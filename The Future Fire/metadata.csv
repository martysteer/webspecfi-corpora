It is every single part of me that makes it so. My love is in the smell of salt from the sea, carried over my Heart River on a summer breeze or a whip of winter wind. Those who come to me for the first time notice it, those who are born here miss it should they ever leave. Since the first lonely wanderer, my wanderer, settled down by my Heart River and called her hut a home, it has been the savory-sweet salt that defined me.",futurefire.net,The Future Fire

Every morning when he walked me up the Candelaría cobblestone to catch my school bus, we passed an old man under the bougainvilleas—clean-pressed shirt, suspenders, rosary beads around his wrist—selling lozenges and chocolates, gums and marshmallow rolls from a leather suitcase on a rough-hewn stump. Some days we would buy, others not, but all days when the bus returned, and my father stood ready to greet me with kisses on all sides, in the old man’s place would be an old woman instead—clean-pressed dress, sturdy shoes, gold cross glinting from the folds of her neck—selling mango slices with a splash of Postobon for added sweetness. Papá would tell me that this was the same person—that some people could transform themselves like this, and more: a sinner, say, by morning, and a saint by night. Just ask the senate, he added with a bitter laugh, as if a child of six understood such things: they made a whole law about it, and called it “peace”. But also, there were people on the streets, he said, who had once been beautiful babies, the lights of their mothers’ eyes—and now look at them, nursing knife wounds with rags and plastic bags on cardboard beds along the underpasses. Such things even a child saw, and knew, and wondered after, but papá’s trick when I was small was to make it look so easy—to be one thing in life, and then another. In practice, though—with him as with so many others—when it came to my own changes, he died before he could see the magic in them, too.",futurefire.net,The Future Fire

I walk behind the counter, and that’s when I see him, on his back, staring up at the ceiling, a pool of congealed blood surrounding his body, soaking into the dusty wooden planks that serve as the floor. He must have been like that for a good few hours, because the rats are already there, licking at the sticky red puddle. If you’re not actively working in K block, the entropy envelops you, devours you. Food, as in meat, as in anyone not strong enough to fend them off, is eaten by the rats.

She found a puddle and squatted down to watch tadpoles swarming through the murky water.

Now shreds of turf were scattered wildly around, some hanging from neighbouring gravestones like wigs. Earth from the grave lay in thick, wet clumps as if whoever had perpetrated this act had done so in a rush, with no care for neatness. A fact that came as no surprise to James, for within the hastily excavated grave was a splintered casket that had once held the Pastor, and within the casket was nothing but the cotton lining that had once comforted the body, and of the body, there was no sign.",futurefire.net,The Future Fire
