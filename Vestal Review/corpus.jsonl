Now a cold, ocherous morning sky follows you all the way to the Tembo Trail, where alone you lean on the icy railing, not sure the elephants will be out, though evidence abounds, elephant snot and mud-smeared Plexiglas, the scent of elephant dung that makes you woozy. But there\u2019s no sign of them, just mounds of sand, and three tall telephone poles rising out the frozen ground, fitted with steel I-beams resembling ribs of an umbrella, over which a dense khaki netting is fastened, dimly reminiscent of yellow fever trees of the Savannah, their silhouettes against a saffron sky, a young Soledad at your side. Alive. You hardly have time to choke back rising grief, to push away from the rail and start home, when Beasley, the trainer, so it says on his nametag, leans in at your elbow like a walking stick, waiting, as young people sometimes wait for recognition.\n\u201cIt\u2019s said,\u201d Beasley says, \u201can elephant won\u2019t pass by a dead elephant without casting a branch or some dust on the body.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any elephants,\u201d you grumble with bilious disinterest.\nBeasley leaves, mercifully, and you notice a hole in a stucco portion of the barrier, a feeding portal, you suppose, hinged wire screen covering, then hear the rumble of elephant steps stopping just the other side.

They swing on vines and eat all of their meals at a long communal table, like civil, smiling Vikings. Victor makes a toast and swashes his apple juice on the person to his left, but it\u2019s ok; The Man on the Scene is nothing if not forgiving.\nEveryone has their job: Sports chops wood for the fireplace; Man and Woman Lead\nAnchors bring home buckets of macaroni and cheese each night for dinner; The Hard-Hitter keeps vigilant watch for bad guys, for there are always bad guys. Victor\u2019s job is to play the banjo while the others gather around and tap their feet. Sports jigs and hambones, and Weather sways like a charmed snake. In his daydream, Victor and the Channel 8 team are just like the Swiss Family Robinson, but much better-looking.\nVictor\u2019s real family doesn\u2019t fit into this scenario. Sometimes, he feels guilty and tries to stick them in. His parents stay in a tree across the way, and he visits them occasionally to eat bowls of cereal and have his temperature taken. His little sister lives with Victor and the news team, but she stays perfectly quiet and still in the corner like a stuffed animal. Eventually, though, his family disappears from the fantasy: they step on a rotted plank and vanish, or the vine they are swinging on snaps and they plummet out of sight.

Sports goes as Magic Johnson, and he looks exactly like him. Man Lead Anchor goes as the Ultimate Warrior, with bumpy muscles all over his arms and legs. Weather goes as a cross between Betsy Ross and a Lady Pirate, and she carries two swords. The Man on the Scene, who is hilarious, goes as a baked potato with sour cream and Baco-Bits. Victor goes as the Ultimate Warrior, too.\nVictor wakes up on his birthday to find the news team has covered the floor with buttered popcorn.

His pulse raced and you had to wonder, is this guy having maybe too good of a time? But foolish me found something infectious in his lively character and found him shaking me awake for a shower at 6:30 a.m. There was a smile on his face as he tore open a new package of Zest. The water ran for a few minutes before he stepped in. The mirror had long since yielded its reflective powers to the steam. His tub was an old clawfoot with a curtain all the way around. A bit unexpected. Given his enthusiasm, I expected something more modern, like a standing-room-only shower, small to keep the heat it in, with a glass door and a high-tech shower head with hundreds of settings. This was quaint. His actions also surprised. This was not just a new venue for groping and petting. He took my hand as I stepped over the edge of this porcelain boat, like a gentleman aiding a lady\u2019s step into an automobile. Felt like a ridiculous act to me, to do nude. But touching. And he let me stand by the water. Turned me around, the water contacted just above my sternum, making divergent paths around both breasts. His fingers massaged shampoo into my scalp, feeling utterly unlike my own fingers in their morning ritual. Yet neither was it like his fingers on my body the night before.He threw open the window curtain and his bathroom flooded with sunlight. His chrome was extra chromey. His tub was extra white and egg-like. I could see texture I\u2019d never seen anywhere else before. The surface of the porcelain had a geography. But when we stepped out, the light was particularly inviting, even given the off-chance that a neighbor would notice our naked bodies through the window. He is so much like a child. He almost believes he has discovered this first. There a conviction as if you\u2019ve never seen a shower before. As if it\u2019s something new and he just has to share. Like the child who discovers a hiding place outside or a new song, bubbling that joy onto his mother. Same with the sunlight. Like it\u2019s his.

I did not realize the earth was quaking, not even as my feet moved side-to-side on a wave of floor tiles. My brother was six months old and the stroller he was sitting in rocked five feet in front of him, ten feet back, and he thought it very amusing. He laughed with his pudgy hands outstretched and flexing. I was in Mexico City, and sixteen.\nOur house was in another part of town, one that was solid because the wealthy lived there, in a place where earthquakes were sure not to cause too much harm. Servants and gardeners, drivers, too, they trickled out of the neighborhood houses and huddled in small groups in the middle of the street. I finished my toast. The television was turned on. I vaguely remember feeling afraid, only because nobody knew where, or when, an aftershock would hit.\nAt school, my teachers had grave looks on their faces and students gossiped about how one teacher had suffered an accident on the metro, the one that had been crushed by falling rubble. It turned out to be a lie.\nI smoked cigarettes in the girls\u2019 bathroom because the earthquake was a good excuse. At lunchtime, I was lonely and hungry, and my mouth was dry. So, I walked into the day, which was gray, and found Teodoro near the tennis courts where the druggies, the marijuanos, sat.\nWe went to our place, the darkest point of the projection room, underneath a table. I stretched on the floor and opened my legs to accommodate him. Teodoro was thin; his body was light on mine. I longed for weight, something heavy to hold me. My hands cradled his buttocks, pulling him onto me, making him heavier, and we kissed. His tongue was thick and covered with a film; it tasted of egg. His hard skinny penis pushed on my belly or along my thigh, it couldn\u2019t decide. And we rocked on each other, our hands in the other\u2019s long hair, our tongues dancing, our breath making the air hot. I moaned, even though I did not like it. My back arched, higher and higher, offering my breasts to his mouth as his hands searched underneath my pants. They were clumsy hands, so I unzipped my jeans, disappointed. It did not matter that it did not feel good, that it was nothing like I had wanted it to be. I moaned anyway.\nI was his sexy woman, rocking underneath his bones.\nI did not like Teodoro. Instead, I had a crush on a boy who would never notice me. Not after lunch. Not even when I pretended to cry and act very touched by the earthquake deaths.

They dove for food or played as if nothing had happened, but the guide knew their paths crisscrossed the spot where the abductors went down, waves destroying the widening circles a scuba rescue team might use to triangulate a dive spot. \u201cRio Dulce,\u201d he told the husband, \u201cmeans River of Death.\u201d He did not say what he thought: \u201cAnother gringo taken means one less of my family will be.\u201d He skippered a tour boat named Pura Vida, which, that night, the husband told the hotel bartender meant \u201cpour me another drink.\u201d\nUnable to get drunk on two cases of cheap lager, the husband stayed awake all night certain that tingling feeling was from little fish that darted up his urethra when he swam in the river. He felt them nose against then nibble on the fleshy tissue of his bladder. In that aquarium, they would erect plastic plants and a mossy sunken pirate ship. They would lay their eggs in his cells. The eggs would hatch, he told the concierge in the morning, and the little fish would reprogram his stem cells, which would divide and replicate into little fish. From the inside out his organs were turning to fish\u2014he could feel it\u2014so he needed a taxi to the river. \u201cTake all my money,\u201d he said, \u201cmy ATM card.\u201d He whispered his PIN and said he needed to be at the river when he became entirely fish, whose millions would disperse to find her, then reunite, school in the shape of his body, and swim her back to land.\nIn a cave of ancient Mayan ruins, the otters keep my friend. There is enough air there for her to live forever. They treat her like a goddess, sacrificing otter virgins and winning athletes to her. They bring her shellfish she cracks open with stones and they praise her ingenuity, though all of them have known the use of this basic tool since youth. She can not hear the inflection of mock-praise in their voices. In other rivers she is otter-myth, woman who swims the Dulce\u2019s length in an hour, who holds her breath for days, who resurrects the souls of all otter dead.

That unexpected bit of cheer brought her out of bed and to the kitchen, where, for the first time, she had a cup of chocolate milk with her father dead.\nYesterday, the grief had caught her in her chest and overflowed her body, filling, then breaking her. She screamed, unprepared.\nAnd yet, as the next morning broke loose she was up. She needed forgiveness for the song. She heard the music evolving inside her, playing her organs, and she listened as if the radio played it. She would have to put her heart aside to play in her head and listen like any audience, to be able to go on.\nAll it took her to learn to walk again was the first day of her father\u2019s death. She would count those days like birthdays. For the dead, her father was a baby, only one day dead. Almost alive.\nThe blues played inside her, a scratched vinyl record that repeated bitter-sweet chords. It was never Mozart or Beethoven, no, Mozart and Beethoven had been her father\u2019s, and Father had taken his classical music wherever he had gone.\nSometimes, a passing scent of warm masculine skin or a dad\u2019s kiss to his daughter broke her, and she screamed in her dreams, and hoped the daylight could glue her pieces together.\nOne morning, the air smelled of the dry southern wind and the nearing summer vacation. Her mother raised her tired eyes, the radio beside her still quiet. She had struggled to save Father and lost, and the radio had been silent since that day.\nThe blues took over the house, disregarding the pop and rock records the girl played too high to be able to hear anything else.\n\u201cTurn it off!\u201d Her mother pleaded.\n\u201cFine,\u201d the girl said. The door closed behind her. She blinked at the sun, but didn\u2019t go back. She hoped that Mother wasn\u2019t crying inside for her long-beloved Beethoven and Mozart.\nThe skin on the girl\u2019s forearm felt unfamiliar and fresh when she crossed her arms. It was summer. She was wearing a short-sleeved shirt for the first time that year. She started running, wildly flailing her arms in the air, and for a brief moment, joy swept away the shards in her chest.\nShe stopped to breathe. The neighbor\u2019s parrot shouted disconnected words with a nasal voice, surprising in a creature without a nose. The woman from the first floor yelled for her son to come home, and he didn\u2019t reply. At the top floor, a dark-skinned mother and her two teenage daughters leaned over the balcony, not to miss a detail of what was going on. Business was as usual.\nShe entered her home and closed the shutters, then, sitting close to her mother, she listened to the silent radio as if it had been playing all along.","source":"https:\/\/vestalreview.net\/blues\/","source-hostname":"Vestal Review","excerpt":"by Avital Gad-Cykman A song about a golden morning played in her head.

Twin upperclassmen from my school\u2019s jazz band inhabit my own. Tiffany wears a red dress and leather jacket. We\u2019re on the dock of a port city. Lamppost light cascades the pier, the boats, the shacks, bathing everything in ochre shadow, a dull shimmer rippling in the black water. We approach a weathered shack. She gestures that we should enter. I hesitate. She notices, smiles with her eyes the way she used to biting down on her saxophone\u2019s mouthpiece. Inside there\u2019s scratchy phonograph music, laughter of self-assured women, clinking glasses, and a host of just-missed secrets, whispers, glances. Outside, silhouettes of men smoke, leaning against the pier\u2019s railing, their deep conspiratorial mumbles falling like cigarette ash.\nTiffany\u2019s never met these people, but she knows them all, and suddenly I\u2019m aware my discomfort brings her pleasure. I suggest we leave; she laughs the way she used to, long ago, when I\u2019d look to her on the morning activity bus heading to some band competition and say, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long day.\u201d Grabbing my hand, she\u2019d sigh, and we\u2019d share a set of headphones until my Walkman\u2019s cheap batteries could no longer be coaxed from the dead with her alkaline voodoo.\nAnother dream: her brother Eddie shakes like Philadelphia ska pumped him full of drugs, left him shriveled, alone, and possessed by deferred fantasies: college, jazz, love. Still the 4-inch pharaoh goatee, the sideburns, the ghost of a gap-toothed grin, he sits beside me in our high school gymnasium. The game is over. We watch a gawky teenager sweep the court in slow, deliberate streaks. Eddie\u2019s misty Chet Baker voice resonates from somewhere above his crumpled heart\u2014the once-familiar tone drowned in gin and \u201cbig city,\u201d so unlike my southern drawl. His words are dammed by a musician\u2019s fury, loneliness, years of collecting urban sorrows he knows I could never understand. Like a Baker solo, he\u2019s on the periphery of spilling everything but isn\u2019t sure he can count on my sympathy, and anyway, could he even begin telling before the sophomore finishes the last streak and the lights come down? So we sit in silence, hypnotized by the glare reflected from the pinewood court.\nIn both dreams, I\u2019m still a teenager, slight and always in clothes a size too large. I\u2019m speechless, numbed at finding my companions so different, like age-enhanced photos of the missing or lost. Many nights I\u2019ve dreamt of them, longing for the flip of her hair, his hand\u2019s grip on my shoulder, the winter scent of her skin, his commiserative confided failures with women\u2014her clairvoyant school bus looks, assuring me she knows my every thought, even the ones I haven\u2019t thought yet, like she knows years later and for the rest of my life, my head will swim with film noir fantasies of her narrow-eyed smile, and her silent ramshackle brother, wasted, and derelict, badly in need of the friend it would take me years of dreams to become.\nDean Marshall Tuck is a writer of fiction and an advisory editor at Tar River Poetry.

Always the red sweatshirt with the hood loose over her head. Always the cream-colored tote.\nShe\u2019d made the mistake of talking to him. He\u2019d leaned in one time and said, \u201cSmells good. Watcha got in there?\u201d He\u2019d been neatly dressed, as always, as if he were returning from an office job, his thin leather coat brushing gently against her. She\u2019d looked warily at him and said, \u201cDinner for my grandmother.\u201d He\u2019d put on a concerned look and asked the girl if her grandmother was sick. Then the girl had smiled and said, \u201cAlways,\u201d before turning away. Her teeth were tiny and slightly crooked, and there was a mole above her lip that at that moment he knew he would have to touch.\nHe watches the girl as she looks around; she\u2019s obviously been trained, knows the dangers of the city and makes sure no one gets too close. She lets go of the pole long enough to push her bangs from her eyes. Her skin is pale, a startling contrast to her black hair and the bright red hood. He\u2019s anxious to feel her skin up close, the soft creamy white that slopes from behind her ear and down the ridge of her jaw. He thinks her skin will taste of freshly baked bread and her blood of cinnamon.\nThe girl inches the sleeve of the sweatshirt down over her wrist. He wonders why the red; doesn\u2019t she know red attracts attention? That it\u2019s the color of whores? It was easy to choose her; she\u2019d taken the train instead of the bus and she\u2019d spoken to him. She\u2019d shown him her teeth, offered up the mole.\nHe\u2019d followed her to the grandmother\u2019s house many times, of course. The watching and planning are some of the best parts, and he prides himself at his stealth. His instincts are flawless and he\u2019ll know exactly the moment to put his plan into action. He\u2019ll go to the grandmother\u2019s house, though he\u2019ll regret missing the girl\u2019s last train ride. He\u2019ll take care of the grandmother first, then he\u2019ll get into her bed and pull the covers over his head. He\u2019ll be still. So still that when the girl comes in she\u2019ll be worried that the grandmother is dead. She\u2019ll pull back her red hood and walk hesitantly toward the bed. \u201cGrandma?\u201d she\u2019ll say through her tiny teeth, and the scent of cinnamon will fill the room.\nCynthia Larsen lives in southern Vermont with her husband and three daughters.

He touches your shoulder so gently, as if you\u2019re not here for the green dollars, and he asks you your real name. Automatically, you tell him; whisper the words in the dark. He repeats them once, and then again, and, suddenly, you hate him. This man in the bed, you hate him now more than all the others that came before, all the others that will come after, all the others combined, because he touched you gently in the dark, because he called you by your real name. Because he said your real name, not once, but twice, as if his green dollars have bought even that; as if his green dollars can buy everything his green uniform won\u2019t let him take. You hate him, this man in the bed, and, as he holds you, you imagine him dead. You hope that, when he gets back to Vietnam, it happens.

They looked for the time when the tide was the lowest, when the water pulled back to expose shiny stones and jagged seashells embedded in the slick mud like mosaic tiles, pinks and corals and ivory cream, when little brown birds scuttled around the frothy baby waves, plucking at the holes bubbling in the mud. His mom liked the shells that were shattered long ago, their once-rough edges polished by the waves breathing over them. The boy liked the shells that were perfect and clean, ones you could buy from a store to place on the bathroom sink.\nIf all the shells on this beach could be ordered in a line, they would guide his mom back home from where she was lost.

A single orange shell flipped over, and the boy ran over to flip it back. And once the boy was back at the end of the line to make it longer, another wave tossed away the gray spotted shell. By the time the water reached where the boy was standing, tucking away half of the seashells that were once exposed on the beach, the boy\u2019s feet were muddied and his toenails caked in sand, and the line he was building was still incomplete.\nThe boy clenched his fists and looked down at his feet. He listened to the waves singing as they danced towards them.\n\u201cShe wants you to know she is still here,\u201d they seemed to say. \u201cShe wants you to know she still loves the sea.\u201d\nThe waves giggled over the boy\u2019s toes.

This particular room in the museum has windows for walls and you can see the weather from anywhere inside it.\nThis is not just me talking, I say. I pause a moment and then keep talking about the weather until I hear myself say, One bolt of lightening and it\u2019s everyone out of the pool time.\nI think I\u2019ve known this woman for years. I think we met in college and have tried for years to get away from each other. The problem is one or the other of us has nothing better to do at any given time.

From the speakers a children\u2019s choir sings in a foreign language that might be Latin.

Why I say this is because I don\u2019t know how she\u2019ll react and I\u2019m curious.\nBetween the choirboys and rainfall the woman can\u2019t hear me, though, and from the look on her face I can tell she\u2019s making her mind up about something, something that might include leaving me here on this bench to go play in the rain, eventually finding her way west to feed the poor of Tempe or Phoenix or wherever it is she\u2019s from and that maybe if I\u2019m lucky she\u2019ll call when she gets there.","source":"https:\/\/vestalreview.net\/everyone-out-of-the-pool\/","source-hostname":"Vestal Review","excerpt":"by Robert Lopez The closest thing to tumbleweed in New York City are the people.I say this out loud to the womanContinue readingEveryone Out of the Pool","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/dpAgukSsr+kKocVTr2OhKBC2kQo.json"}

The night before, I was out on the front porch with a beer trying to look at the sky, one of those nights when the stars \u2026 the moon and Venus together looked like the Turkish flag. There was a garden tool of some kind, a trowel, I remember thinking, on the steps, and it reminded me that I\u2019d told her I would water the snapdragons. But the mint, the damn mint was growing everywhere, and the snapdragons had been dead for weeks.\nI traded in the Buick for that truck, and four thousand bucks, all for a hundred thousand more miles and a ride like a hay wagon. But this is America, right, and if you can\u2019t throw away money on a truck \u2026 I loved that truck. It was blue except where it was rusty, and it pulled hard to the left when you hit the brakes, and the four-wheel drive ground like a nightmare, but I loved it. On the fire roads with her, ponderosa pines and sun-warmed granite. I thought it would be good luck.\nThe doctor appointment was at three o\u2019clock. We got up early, and I looked up where the sliver of moon had crooked toward Venus. There were high cirrus clouds.\nNo, wait, the snapdragons weren\u2019t dead yet. That was when she asked me to water them. That morning. I was thinking, Which flag was it, the one with the moon and the star, or was it really Venus on the flag?\nWater the snapdragons, okay? she said from inside. I was having coffee, and there were high cirrus clouds.\nYeah, I said, and stood there instead listening to her move around in the living room. She picked up this and that. Nervous.

So no, I hadn\u2019t told her I\u2019d water the snapdragons. That was after I first saw the thing on the steps. But it was still there when she said, Water the snapdragons, okay? I think that\u2019s why I forgot to ask her what it was.\nIt was my idea to take the truck. Good luck, I thought. The grinding was in the clutch, not the four-wheel drive, and if I\u2019d paid attention when my dad told me about cars, I\u2019d have known. Anyway it kicked out of gear on Alameda and I jumped a little. We\u2019d been trying for a long time. I was optimistic about this doctor. I was nervous, and I hit the brakes a little hard.

Jane was not amused. When she got really into anything\u2014astrology, raw food, that self-help book with laws about attraction and weight loss and wealth\u2014she was like an Evangelist: single minded and humorless.\nBut I went to the class anyway, because when you\u2019re single or married (or something in between), you take classes, Winter Gardening and Malaysian Appetizers and Beginning Didgeridoo. What Jane didn\u2019t tell me is that Mateo taught class bare-chested, and his skin was smooth and brown and hard and curved. Like that ceremonial effigy vase I saw in the ceramics exhibit last Spring. Come to think of it, that came from South America, too. Those terra cotta curves extended through Mateo\u2019s arms, down his belly, past his belly (not that my eyes lingered there), into his long, long legs. He wore crimson pants made from fabric that clung and shimmered and draped and sang.\n\u201cHe\u2019s gay,\u201d Jane whispered, and I said, \u201cReally?\u201d and she said, \u201cCome on, look at him,\u201d and I did look. Mateo floated his arms and his legs through space, in front and back and left and right and places in between. I did what Mateo did, tried to make my arms and legs float, but I was like a drunken tiger heron, aching to fly. \u201cInhale the moment,\u201d he\u2019d say in that accent, and he\u2019d shimmy his bare brown chest.\nWhen my hair slipped out of its ponytail, I didn\u2019t reach up to shove strands back under the band, not even when it all came loose and the band fell to the floor. The thought I had when I first saw Mateo\u2019s bare chest, Crap, I should\u2019ve worn make-up, drifted off, my willow limbs waving it away. And when he had us do that quiet snapping thing, I said aloud, \u201cIt\u2019s not like butterflies. It\u2019s fireflies,\u201d the tiny force that turns swamps into magic. If it wasn\u2019t for my floating drunk through space like it was just mine, mine, he might not have picked up the hair band after class and said, \u201cThis is yours, no?\u201d, fingers touching mine, and I might not have gone to his loft where walls and windows were draped with crimson that shimmered when we moved. His terra-cotta curves rolled over mine, his fingers above my head and to my sides and down by other places, too, like butterflies or fireflies, snapping.\nLiz Prato plays with words in beautiful Portland, Oregon.

But it felt like being watched through binoculars, and I did my best to avoid him. This tactic fended him off till spring, but John was persistent and smart about some things.

A shotgun poked out of the driver\u2019s window and blasted it point blank, and then the hearse sped away.

On the dresser three My Little Ponies stare with that cocktease expression they have, showing their rainbowed asses. You can guess why the aunt, distracted, hung over, thought I\u2019d make a good gift. And had the girl been five or six, she might have used my comb to brush my synthetic mane.\nThe girl is older, though, too old for this horse stuff, in my opinion.

Now he could wrap his fingers around my neck or encircle my waist with one hand. His thumb alone covered my eyes with little effort. Still we danced, he clasping his growing hands behind him, me reaching, chasing, 5,6,7,8 to grab onto them.\nWhen the music stopped I had to buy yet another set, elastic and elephant, and he pulled them on and flexed as if to say perfect fit.\nWhen his one hand spanned my entire torso from chin to hip, I sewed him a pair myself from all the old gloves, a patchwork of leather as wide as a sheet. Still his hands dangled down from his sleeves, fingers brushing the ground when he stood to kiss me. Each day the fingers, palms, bones, and tendons stretched and stretched until he could hold the house with one and my whole self with just a finger. I would sleep in one hand at night or when he worked; he would look at me with sad eyes as if to apologize for his giant hands and regular-sized heart.\nWe went on like this, my body in his hands, his body farther and farther away in the house while his hands lengthened on. We ceased to speak \u2013 his voice now came from so far away even shouting could not bridge the distance. Eventually, he had to sleep in the attic, and while he rested, his hands spilled out of the house, through the dormered windows, past the second story and the bottom floor, into the garden.\nI would stand near a finger in the backyard and he would stroke me, hoping that it made me happy, but just as often his touch would knock me down onto the patio or into the neighbor\u2019s yard.\nWinter\u2019s storms brought leaves and branches down on top of the tarps I had dragged over his hands, and dirt drifted under and between folds of skin.

I\u2019m lost, I admit, in a world without edges, and when the world softens, when I seem to have gone somewhat or entirely to the bad in my failure to perform my daredevil stunts often enough, or with enough in the way of sprezzatura and arpeggios, then the world\u2019s frames, the outlines for which I have gone to so much trouble, appear to disintegrate, melting, fading, or falling away \u2014 and this, I am not afraid to tell you bluntly, this scares the shit out of me.\nThen it is time to go back. Back to the circus! New stunts!\nMy latest dissolution may be dated precisely. One night, a man I only vaguely recognized kissed me extravagantly under the big top. He wore white greasepaint and spoke with his hands, which I found perfectly charming until I developed a weeping rash that crusted my lips with hieroglyphs so I was forced to speak like him, in pantomime. What I feel I must tell you is this: I have come to believe that when he kissed me, he used his tongue to inscribe under mine something terrible, a curse or the name of God. Yes, the kiss undermined me, and at once I was his golem: a stone monster in sudden animation, haunting the city limits, scaring children and pets, animated with the force of someone\u2019s desire, though I couldn\u2019t say whose, exactly.\nWe were disturbed, protean, rejected. I tried to make him speak, but for all my frantic questioning \u2014 all fingers, all thumbs \u2014 he wouldn\u2019t answer. Where I wanted a world of chattering, he vouchsafed only a tombstone silence: sphinx in my bedlam.\nNow, I\u2019m infected; I\u2019m on the phone, I\u2019m on the wire, I\u2019m talking blunt. The universe shoots like noisy rhubarb from my mouth; from immense heights, I spout prayer, psalms and unsolicited advice. Despite everything I still give coins to clowns and trinkets to men in greasepaint but I have learned to use caution when kissing them under the big top. When performing well, I forget the net and avoid the guidewire. What keeps me in the air, the only rule: transact, transact, transact.\nDiane\u2018s work has appeared in The Laurel Review, The Saint Ann\u2019s Review, Poets & Writers Magazine, The American Book Review, and Art New England.

Coffee last week was only OK, really OK-minus, and that probably should have been enough for her.

She left it a little open- ended and when he called, which she wasn\u2019t sure he was going to, she said yes to lunch.

Let them guess what she does on weekends.\nThen too, it\u2019s a lonely watch, holding inside you the word that, when spoken, will end time. It makes her give the benefit of the doubt to some pretty marginal guys. In Austria in the late Renaissance, she dated the inventor of the comb-over. Well, he was very polite, she would tell you with some sharpness.\nAnd that\u2019s the other thing. She\u2019s not exactly Miss Perky Happyshoes. She can be a little prickly.

Nothing about this man surprises me. He controls an important segment of the rock music industry. He has power while I have none. We are in bed in this fancy Monte Carlo hotel. The halls have birds in the wallpaper and bird chirps that come from a sound system. He has mentioned the chirps annoy him. Our drapes are open and blowing a little from a sultry breeze off the balcony.\nBut you and I are so good, he\u2019s saying. What do I need a Thai whore for, when I have you? He\u2019s stroking slowly between my legs.\nI want to say: Are you for real? That this makes me feel terrible. Is he saying I\u2019m a whore? Has he paid for me? No. Has he bought my airline ticket? No. He has bought me food and will pay the hotel bill. Period. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite the same category as paying for a whore. I almost loved you, my mind is whispering.\nI push the sheet off.\nWhat\u2019s the matter? he says.\nNothing. I have to use the bathroom.\nMake sure you wipe front to back, he says.\nYes, I know about front to back. I was well brought up.\nHe laughs. Of course you were. I just needed something to break the ice.\nI turn and look at him. Naked on top of the covers. He has a full erection. Hurry in there, he says. I need you back.\nNeed. Now there\u2019s an interesting word coming from this man. I continue looking at his erection. Large, and does the job it\u2019s intended for. What does that make him?\nDon\u2019t be mad, he\u2019s saying.\nI\u2019m not mad.\nYou have a gorgeous body. Don\u2019t be mad about the whores.\nI could care less about the whores, I say. But you should worry. You should worry about catching a fatal disease.\nAnd I\u2019m thinking he will never have me again. Not after the whores. I step into the bathroom; towels cover the floor like a damp crooked-carpet nightmare.\nIt\u2019s his thing\u2014spreading out the wet towels after showering. I want to say, But the cool marble feels good underfoot. I may have asked why the towels, at some point. Whether he answered, I can\u2019t remember.\nThe wide bathroom mirror is glazed with smoky vines along its edges. My face in the mirror looks the same. My body. Though the one-piece swimsuit has left an almost obscene bleached version of my skin contrasted against its tan parts. Other than that, I\u2019m the same. Good, bad, indifferent, I don\u2019t seem to alter. Is this some personal flaw? I would like just once for him to see the true me. But I also know it would ruin everything.

The top drawer is where I keep my stationery; the middle drawer contains mainly instruction manuals for my computer, a scientific calculator, and other devices; and the bottom drawer is where I hide things.\nFour years ago, when job stress got to be too much, I hid a bottle of whiskey in this bottom drawer. Hid it, but never touched it. It\u2019s still there, unopened, pushed to the back. After that, I hid a handgun. It\u2019s loaded, sitting next to the whiskey, unused now for three years.\nThis worked for a little while, made things easier, knowing that when depression hit, I had some whiskey and a gun. I could take action.\nIf I wanted to.\nBut for the past year, it hasn\u2019t been enough, and I\u2019ve realized that this stress has little to do with my job. I feel ashamed when I think of the whiskey bottle and the gun, because I know I\u2019d never use them.\nA few months ago, I started hiding receipts for mundane things, like movie tickets, wiper blades, bags of chips, DVDs, everything.\nUntil last week, when I decided to use my bottom drawer to hide more important things, things that deserved to be next to the whiskey bottle and the gun.\nIn a tiny envelope, beside the bottle, I carefully placed my dream that I\u2019d find someone to share my life with. In another envelope, I breathed my sexual secrets, licked the glue along the envelope\u2019s flap, tucked it snugly under the gun.\nI filled the middle of the drawer with pages of conversations written in longhand\u2014discussions, as well as I can remember them, with people no longer in my life. I stapled these together, grouped by association.\nFriend, parent, lover, child.\nI wrapped my love for my children in elastic bands, left it near the front of the drawer, so I could find it easily. So that on very bad days, my hand would touch this knotted bundle before finding the items at the back.\nAt night, when people drifted lazily out the doors to their successful lives, I locked my top two drawers, but always left the bottom drawer unlocked\u2014and slightly open, maybe a quarter of an inch.\nI wanted someone to open it. A nosy cleaning lady. A curious co-worker. Maybe they\u2019d be inspired to add things of their own, wrap little pieces of their lives in stationery, nestle them next to my secrets. Hiding who they really were, who they really wanted to be, just to make life easier.\nBut every morning, I\u2019d come into the office, and no one had opened it; no one had touched a thing.\nLast night, after work, I opened my bottom drawer, leaned over and pushed down with both hands, shoved it all as far back as possible.\nLet them try now. Let them work for it. Let them sweat. Courage takes work.\nBrett Alexander Savory is a Bram Stoker Award-winning editor. His day job is also as an editor, at Harcourt Canada in Toronto.

A mask that matched his favorite jeans. A mask that fooled his boss into believing he was hard at work. The masks he made hung along a clothesline in his basement workshop. Vacation Mask. Mask of Fatherly Concern. He made a mask he showed the neighbors when they remodeled their kitchen. A mask that communicated his undivided attention to his wife\u2019s complaints about her co-workers. He produced a series of masks reserved entirely for his wife: Mask of Romance and Seduction, Copulation Mask, Mask of Unwavering Devotion. The unused masks hung slack and empty in the dim basement light until it was time for him to show them to the world. Workday Mask. Mask of Small Talk in an Elevator. Polite Laughter Mask. Mask of Longing and Despair. He made a mask he wore to the altar for communion, and a separate mask he showed the lord in private.\nWhen the recession hit, he could no longer afford the raw materials needed to manufacture new masks, so he took to re-using old masks for a while, but if you looked closely you could see they were chipped and frayed and peeling at the edges, their colors faded and smeared in places, the skin loose and saggy-looking. Then, he got the bright idea that he could re-appropriate masks that were originally intended for other occasions. He brought his Dinner Mask to work for lunch and vice versa, and once he tried to swap out his Mask of Concern for the Defecation Mask he usually left hanging from the shower rod.\nAs the recession dragged on and his few remaining functional masks fell further into disrepair, he devised a desperate plan to create an all-purpose mask, one that projected the sort of milquetoast affability that would render him agreeable to the general public. So he locked himself in the basement and worked around the clock for days, using only the spare materials he had lying around: an old ball of twine, tufts of animal fur, a dried up wad of chewing gum.\nIt was a modest mask, but it was made with great care. And for a while, it held up admirably and served its purpose well. But eventually, he started leaving the mask lying around the house, where it would gather dust and grease stains and the dog would chew on it when no one was looking. In time, it looked beaten and sun-bleached and its expression had warped into a sort of deranged rictus of a smile. At night when he was asleep, his wife would retrieve the mask from his bedside and wipe it carefully with a wet rag and spruce it up as best she could and return it to his nightstand, where in the morning he would fumble for it in the dark and pull it carelessly back over his skull and go out of his way to avoid mirrors everywhere he went.","source":"https:\/\/vestalreview.net\/maskmaker-fallen-on-hard-times\/","source-hostname":"Vestal Review","excerpt":"By Jamie Cooper He had a mask for every occasion.

Not the downy softness we had superstitiously believed. I have to be careful not to roll too suddenly onto sharp-edged pinions; I already wear the badge of small red scratches. Clouds outnumber angels; silver, ivory, shades of billowing grey, and blue. In that roiling stew of wind-stirred cotton I am the flesh. It is the sound that always wakes me, not trumpets or ethereal choirs, but the ominous rumbling of clouds meeting and the sharp snap and rustle of angel wings flexed.\nArmageddon, people had cried. God has forsaken us. Only true believers need apply. Why angels chose the skeptic, I\u2019ll never know. It was worth it, after admonishing end-of-the-worlders to deal with their lives and stop pinning hopes on fantasies, to see their shocked, reddening faces as I was plucked away. Then again, I was just as surprised.\nWhy, I asked. To see our point of view, they said. So they will stop praying to us. I\u2019m not an angel, I said. My view will always be different.\nThey looked heavenward and yawned perfect yawns. Rather than fly over God\u2019s flock, they prefer to hang in the air, silent, unmoving, as varicolored as the birds. The old painters came closer than modern romantics, who would flinch when angels fight, just like birds, over a thrown scrap of bread.\nI am ready to return. I don\u2019t know which one brought me; there are so many. Even with celestial eyesight, angels rarely watch our world. The clouds are everywhere and they would have to fly too close to people\u2019s prayers. It is their watching that unnerves me. It is like the vulture waiting for the man to die.

I spent days washing clothes, towels, curtains and bedding on hot, and drying each load for two hours. Before bed, instead of our normal silent relaxation, he played on his laptop shooting rogue militia while I sprawled out on the inflatable bed reading Descartes and filling my Moleskine with incoherent ramblings.\nWe waited for the bugs to disappear, setting traps and spreading homeopathic dusts. Each night the distance between our beds grew bigger, as well as our resentment in comfort levels.

He saw that the circles under my eyes had become coal-colored crescents begging for comfort. We had hunted with a vacuum cleaner, a spray bottle filled with soap and alcohol, masking tape, mattress covers and thin layers of diatomaceous earth squirted from a plastic ketchup bottle. He agreed to be bait, and let the bugs, if they were still there, take his body like a canap\u00e9. He slept on the bed, but I woke him just in time to save him from the tiny army of blood-sucking nuisances scurrying away from the light. That night, I dreamt of body invasions and floods of bugs in the sink, bathtub and toilet. My skin felt used, and sizzled at the thought of being served a la carte.\nInstead of caresses and bedtime embraces, we scoured information in the glow of technology, hoping to rid ourselves of the vast distances\u2014living room to bedroom, floor to couch, skin to skin. I wanted to hear his breath and smell the sweat on his pillowcase.\nI tiptoed around our bedroom, glaring at the undressed bed. It was taped off like a crime scene.

Bronx locals, muscled blacks in tanks and low-slung jeans, one leg rolled up. Puny students from the prep school waiting to go home to Westchester and Connecticut.

The sky keeps changing\u2014blue, grey, silver, yellow rays of sun. Earlier it opened, streamed rain. The movement is making me queasy.\nBut the cats on my porch are lying still. The black and white kitten snore-purrs against my arm and the warm, vibrating comfort of her makes my eyes wet.

Most cats are graceful, it\u2019s true, but this one is not. She misses when she leaps, as often as she lands. Sometimes I am embarrassed for her.\nMy son has never met this clumsy cat, nor the charismatic kitten next to me. He is acquainted with only one of the three cats sleeping on the porch of my divorcee\u2019s cottage: the oldest, a dignified striped tabby who mostly keeps to himself (when not pissing on a rug) and who my boyfriend says would vote Republican.\nIt\u2019s been two years since he went to college and his father and I sold our porchless, white-washed house, and already I have two cats my son knows nothing of. Not that he cares. He pretends to hate cats, but he was jealous of any attention I ever paid them.\nNow my son is unreachable, and I have three cats on my porch. Beautiful, composed and ridiculous.

And then everything we owned, starting with the stepladders, then our clothes. The new bassinet and changing table, the toys and mobiles. The couch and TV, the stove and spice rack. We painted everything that exact, perfect color. The shade of us. Eventually the entire interior of the house was the color of skin, a perfect cocoon.\n\u201cSomething\u2019s missing,\u201d you said.\nIt was true. It was too uniform, too monochromatic. \u201cWe need wrinkles. Freckles.\u201d I said.\n\u201cMoles. Fingerprints.\u201d You said.\nWe started again. As you spread the paint, thicker this time, I followed behind, adding detail. Poking pores into the wet paint with my finger, scratching fine laughlines into the corners of the rooms. I tore apart brooms and brushes, and made random patches of hair with their bristles. At times we mixed a little pink into the paint, or added a little gravel for texture. It still wasn\u2019t enough. We stood within our cocoon, but no matter how much detail we added, it didn\u2019t feel real.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a layer. No depth,\u201d you said.\nWe went out and got more paint. Reds as rich as blood, gallons of tendon gray, cans of liver mauve and bile ocher. We painted the exterior of the house all the colors we knew existed within us. You shaded the siding like sinew and muscle; the latticework became chalky white bone. I traced fluid veins and arteries lightly across it all in iron-red and icy blue, the two structures twining around each other, branching into smaller lines until linked together with purple capillaries no thicker than a brushstroke.\nFinally, we finished. \u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d you said, calling me from the front door, a dark red muscle, the passageway into a perfect, four-chambered heart, the screen flapping lightly in the gathering breeze.\nMatthew Smart lives in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan with his wife and four children, where he works as an information technology analyst.

And he has to grab you to keep you from falling. He holds onto your arm a little longer than necessary, you think. He\u2019s probably your age, though hard to gauge in the twilight. When he looks down at his mop after he\u2019s detached himself from your arm, you detect shyness.\nYou unlock your door and flip the light switch. Suddenly the room is illuminated and very clean. The shy man has washed your floors, every black skid and heel mark gone. You can\u2019t remember the last time your floors were washed. And then, you notice something is missing: a candy bar, raspberry-filled chocolate, that was lying on your desk. You were looking forward to unwrapping its shiny red paper and slipping it into your mouth when your classes were finished. As you lock the door and head out, the janitor bows his head and bellows an overly-cheerful goodnight.\nA week later, you are swimming in a pool by yourself, lost in the soft blue glow. A woman eases into the lane next to you. She uses only one arm, the left, for the first five laps, and then switches to the right. You think her motion curious, but say nothing. She finishes her workout before you do and hoists out of the water in one motion.\nBy the time you head to the locker room, you catch the back of her slipping out the door. When you open your locker, you know someone has been through your things. Everything has fallen from the hooks in a heap and you can\u2019t find your underpants. Once they held a shape, suggesting sharp pelvic bones and a hollow stomach. But there has been slippage. Who would want them? You pull on your jeans, their stiffness a little closer.\nYou don\u2019t tell anyone about the thefts. You imagine yourself saying, \u201cSomeone stole a candy bar from my office,\u201d and balk. You don\u2019t report the theft of your underpants, either. No, you won\u2019t officially report the missing items. At first you were disturbed by the intrusions; now you begin to savor them. The world goes on, with its tedious classes and swimming lanes leading nowhere. You encounter the janitor in the cold evenings, lingering near your office with his mop as if he were standing in the center of a field. You swim next to the woman who took your underpants and feel her breath rising. You never speak to either, only give a quick nod.\nLet him eat the candy bar slowly. Let him make the bar last, savoring the tiny bursts of raspberry quivering on his tongue. And let her wear the underpants next to her skin. Let them tuck the stolen items away in a secret cache and visit them nightly in a seizure of rapture.\nMarcia Aldrich is the author of Girl Rearing (W.W.

She doesn\u2019t know how to tell you no, as though the word might crack her porcelain mouth.\nYou visit Josie when Hannah is out of town, with her friends, or otherwise occupied. Josie understands your loneliness like faith. She keeps red wine on hand and you drink out of mismatched glass tumblers, playing The Smiths\u2019 Strangeways, Here We Come on vinyl. If you come by early enough, she makes dinner: stir-fried vegetables and udon noodles, grilled portabellas, pesto.\nOn the couch she doesn\u2019t stop your hands from wandering up her legs.

She trembles under your touch and you feel like a man. Hannah doesn\u2019t tremble the way Josie does. The wine makes you whisper I adore you, I\u2019ll never leave you, you\u2019re the only one who understands me. You know you don\u2019t mean it and you know she doesn\u2019t believe it, but you say it every single time.\nYou ache for her body because it is there. Your hands grip her waist, your mouth clamps down on hers. You are so hard in your jeans that the anguish of want brings tears to your eyes. You put your hand between her thighs, parting them with a twist of your wrist, bracing yourself against her. Her body is sweet and warm in a way that Hannah couldn\u2019t ever be. Josie needs you and you need to be needed.\nYou sleep on your side with her arms around you. The morning is shy and sober; you shower alone and dress before she sees you naked. By then, Hannah has texted you to say she\u2019s ready to see you. You finish your coffee and say goodbye to Josie.

Already drying out in the warmth of tea and body heat of customers, her hair had started to regain its shape and colour.\nIt was after she said something, I forget what, that it happened. She might have said important things like, See you again this time next week, but songs jumped into my brain, nothing decipherable, just guitars and drums, voices, screams, a jammed keyboard, layered and twisted together. I dared to hold my face up, bolted together by its ridiculous nose. I felt like I should get under the table and stay there.\nThe tea had kept the cold off a bit, the shut door, but soon it seeped through the unheated room and gripped us all. The talk filtered out as everyone contemplated the temperature, except me. She said she had to go; snarlings of song, of guitar came out of my mouth at her. She bestowed, through her cleared glasses, a glossy, reflecting look that had our history in it somewhere. The song burst in an explosion down my nostrils, through my throat. I felt her trying to help me, pat my back, call for water.\nShe disappeared into the ice-bound air through a door which when opened rang a bell. As its sound died away, all the muffled customers looked my way. I couldn\u2019t see her go because of the condensation on the window.\nAlan Beard has had stories in many magazines, including London Mag and Malahat Review, anthologies such as Neonlit, England Calling, webzines such as In Posse Review and Taint magazine.

Cousin Deanna stole her first boyfriend. Brother Tim burned her books; father\u2014where was father? Mother, she baked corn muffins and planted tulips and said things like Honey, you\u2019re forgetting yourself. And always she herself, Tanya: boots, tears, stomping, wiping, no-one-is-listening, hear-me, forget-it. She crumples the flyer\u2014ten sessions free for unresolved grief\u2014and thinks. No way is she unresolving anything. She says, No way am I unraveling my onion for nobody.\nBut of course Auntie Sylvia is persistent: Tanya honey, you could enjoy things again; you could actually laugh sometimes. Wouldn\u2019t that be good? A little giggle, a little joy? Tanya calls the number, not because Auntie Sylvia says But things might even taste good again. The therapist quits after three sessions, saying things like no willingness and unbudging.\nSo days pass and there Tanya is again: broken, boots, blackened, thinking This always will be, but also wondering, How long is the lifespan of a grudge, the duration of misfortune? She thinks if there were two of her, she\u2019d tell the other it is long past time to be so clenched. She goes over to the closet, to her long military surplus coat, the wool green one with stripes that mean something, and says, Lets us two go outside for awhile. She hangs the coat on a tree limb, still on its hanger, and rests her bony hands on the shoulders, wondering how to confront a jacket with truth and past and fright. She thinks the coat will cry. She thinks the coat will ask for another chance. She thinks the coat will send out its arms and say, Come to me so we can still be pissed off together. If it does, she\u2019ll kick it so hard.\nBefore she brings herself to speak, a shoulder slips from the hanger as the branch bends. It sways and bounces, while the wind rustles about. The coat is a heavy wool coat. There it is now, crumpled in the dirty snow. You, she says. Lapel still stiff. Stripes in a row.

It was a desperate thought, really. He loosened his tie. Something in him was strangling. She waited on the bed in her underwear,rubbing her feet together playfully.\nDuring puberty and his early \u201920s, he\u2019d read so many books before his nine o\u2019clock bedtime that, he assured himself, without doubt, even though he\u2019d never had one in the flesh, he\u2019d had plenty of girls by proxy.\nHe had been cocky from the first day of their relationship. He had actually asked her out. An old man had tripped on some broken concrete in front of his house. She had come to the rescue and had asked to use his phone to call the old man\u2019s son. He thought, \u201ckindness floated on her like mist over London.\u201d She seemed accessible to him.\nOn their third date she had asked him, \u201cAre you a playful little boy?\u201d\nHe had never been winked at like that before. He could tell she conducted these matters on eye-to-eye ground. Obviously, he was not on that level. But the fact that she assumed he was made him sit straight and smile.\nUp to this point he had likened their relationship to a whitewater river. Tonight, on the way to her house, he felt like he was going over the falls.\nNow, nearly naked, he watched her wiggle and mess up the bed sheets. Those luxurious wrinkles bothered him. He caught the view of the two of them in the mirror above her dresser. In a scene like this, he wondered, how could any man worry? The fact that he worried distressed him even more.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d A stray chocolate brown curl flopped over her eye.\nHe felt like a harried plate spinner. His hesitation to start \u201cThe Carnival of Love\u201d allowing a few plates to fall.\n\u201cWhat about this? Maybe this will speed up the race.\u201d She proficiently kicked off her panties and undid her bra. The sight of her wearing nothing gave him what he called the \u201cRaskolnikov Shakes.\u201d\nHer pubic hair didn\u2019t seem as confined and tamed as it was in paintings he had seen. Her breasts were flatter than all those statues had brought him to expect.\n\u201cYou\u2019re shaking.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I\u2019m not\u2026\u201d He felt more exposed than he would have if he\u2019d actually removed his boxers. Now that all was laid bare, he flashed on their future together. The practicality of the relationship certainly wouldn\u2019t change. But he questioned if she would still smile the same light-bending hello? Would they still have the same coy conversations?\nLike a flash of lightning in a storm, a Raymond Chandler quote occurred to him. \u201cBeyond fear, beyond change.\u201d It was a description of a dead guy.\nThis is Ryan Nelson\u2019s first story to see publication.","source":"https:\/\/vestalreview.net\/reading-sex\/","source-hostname":"Vestal Review","excerpt":"by Ryan Nelson For him sex and romance were literary categories.

Then I came home from work to find her sitting on her packed bags and smoking in the living room. She looked past me through half-closed eyes when she told me that it wasn\u2019t working out, that she was leaving, going back to her ex in Chicago. Oh, and her flight was at eight; could I drive her to Logan?\nI drove her to the airport, because this is the sort of man I am.\nI\u2019d put her suitcases in the trunk; I was too taken aback at her sudden decision to leave to wonder what was in the plastic grocery bag she kept looped over one wrist. I navigated Boston traffic in stunned silence, eventually pulling into the passenger drop-off lane at Terminal B.\nDouble-parked and with blinkers on, I wrestled her suitcases to the curb, and apparently by way of a tip, she handed me the plastic bag: \u201cHere, I was going to make something out of these lemons, but I ran out of time. Use them so they don\u2019t go bad, okay?\u201d And then she turned to a skycap and I was two feet away but miles gone from her life.\nBack in the car, I put the bag on the passenger seat. Five minutes later a cab cut me off, and the lemons spilled onto the floor, rolling around in the footwell all the way back home. They smelled sharp and clean.\nWhen I got home, I fished them from the car and brushed off the sand and road salt. They were perfect: large, firm, that shade of yellow that only comes in citrus and crayons. Their rind was invitingly dimpled and vaguely oily to the touch.\nWith the first, I heeded an old adage and made lemonade. I had to add sugar four times before it tasted right, and then I messed it up by adding too much mint.\nI squeezed and zested the next two to make a lemon pie from a recipe I found in a cookbook I\u2019d never opened before. It turned out quite well, though I couldn\u2019t eat it fast enough by myself and eventually had to throw a third of it away when it got moldy.\nI put the last one under my pillow before I went to sleep. I\u2019m not sure why.\nThree days later I could still smell her cigarette in the living room when I found that I had voicemail from her: she asked if she\u2019d left a bag of lemons in my car. If so, could I mail them to her?\nI pulled the last one from underneath my pillow and sent it overnight express. Because this is the sort of man I\u2019m trying hard not to be.","source":"https:\/\/vestalreview.net\/when-life-hands-you\/","source-hostname":"Vestal Review","excerpt":"By Jack Miller This is the sort of woman she was: when she left me, she actually asked me for a rideContinue readingWhen Life Hands You","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/LmENKimRCjQWm74MEmatPY921yE.json"}

And everything that touches you affects you, marks you. And you remember.\nSo fingers remember the feel of wood, the intoxicating flesh on flesh of a lover\u2019s touch, the burn of extreme temperatures. And this finger in its icy cavern remembers everything. Just because it may appear inactive now, resting, one might say, does not diminish this.\nWater remembers more than anything because it changes so little. It does its job and is washed away, excreted, ending up time and time again in the ocean, misting into the clouds to grow fat and heavy again, coming down to a new reality. It remembers the rivers, the beakers, the cisterns, the bellies, the puddles and ponds. Everything trying to hold it and nothing quite managing to.\nNot until now. Another long rest in the cold. But it knows and understands that there is all the time in the world, that the darkness will not last.\nIt\u2019s different for the finger. The finger has been distressed for some time. If it had any kind of motor ability, it would even now be fighting the cold sleep, rousing itself in a glove of ice and scratch, scratch, scratching on the walls to find a way out.\nMost of all, it misses the ring. Nothing special. It was never going to rule them all, never going to find them. But the finger had grown accustomed to the ring and felt its absence\u2014the weight of it has left a pasty impression at its base, an indentation.\nThe finger cannot see the darkness, cannot hear the silence. All it can do is feel the rough surface, abrasive and icy, on its sensitive tip.\nBrains only get so much information. The stimuli have a long way to go: the length of an arm; the expanse of a shoulder; the busy traffic of a spine, with everything trying to rush there first. I\u2019m hungry. I\u2019m itchy. I\u2019m wearing cotton. I\u2019ve got a blister. Urgent stimuli bruising their way to the front of the queue. So much gets missed. The tip of a finger could tell you so much more.\nIt remembers many things: the shock of the first unaccountably dry thing it ever touched, the shape of building blocks, the hastily wiped-away stickiness, the hair of a dog, the tactile teasing of play dough, the rough gabardine of a school coat. And so much more\u2014the sting of a ruler\u2019s slap, the rough twist of a rope, the fumble of a missed catch, other fumblings.\nBut it is important for the finger to remember the last thing that it touched. Important to hold that information. Important to remember the scratching, to hold his torn flesh beneath the frozen nail. He likes to keep his souvenirs. They\u2019re all here like pale vegetables. One day. One day.\nClare Kirwan has won short story competitions in Dark Tales and The Nerve magazines and also performs poetry with Liverpool\u2019s Dead Good Poets Society.","source":"https:\/\/vestalreview.net\/a-finger-in-the-freezer\/","source-hostname":"Vestal Review","excerpt":"by Clare Kirwan You cannot go through any kind of life untouched.

I gave my love a pair of kid gloves, thin and soft, to protect his lovely hands \u2013 but found my gift was too small: time had passed between the measurement of my palm against his, finger pressed upon finger, wrist flush against wrist, a little warm hollow between our palms.\nI bought a larger pair but after a time his hands were again too big \u2013 five fingers soon poked out the ends. Now he could wrap his fingers around my neck or encircle my waist with one hand. His thumb alone covered my eyes with little effort. Still we danced, he clasping his growing hands behind him, me reaching, chasing, 5,6,7,8 to grab onto them.\nWhen the music stopped I had to buy yet another set, elastic and elephant, and he pulled them on and flexed as if to say perfect fit.\nWhen his one hand spanned my entire torso from chin to hip, I sewed him a pair myself from all the old gloves, a patchwork of leather as wide as a sheet. Still his hands dangled down from his sleeves, fingers brushing the ground when he stood to kiss me. Each day the fingers, palms, bones, and tendons stretched and stretched until he could hold the house with one and my whole self with just a finger. I would sleep in one hand at night or when he worked; he would look at me with sad eyes as if to apologize for his giant hands and regular-sized heart.\nWe went on like this, my body in his hands, his body farther and farther away in the house while his hands lengthened on. We ceased to speak \u2013 his voice now came from so far away even shouting could not bridge the distance. Eventually, he had to sleep in the attic, and while he rested, his hands spilled out of the house, through the dormered windows, past the second story and the bottom floor, into the garden.\nI would stand near a finger in the backyard and he would stroke me, hoping that it made me happy, but just as often his touch would knock me down onto the patio or into the neighbor\u2019s yard.\nWinter\u2019s storms brought leaves and branches down on top of the tarps I had dragged over his hands, and dirt drifted under and between folds of skin. While he slept the gray days away, his fingers rooted in the damp soil, married the dirt and lay there until spring, when his end came.\nAnd then the fingers, knuckles first, pushed up through the greening earth, unfurling their joints one by one to stand straight up to the sun.\nAll day all night they wave to me, calling my name.","source":"https:\/\/vestalreview.net\/hands-and-gloves\/","source-hostname":"Vestal Review","excerpt":"By Judy French From the first his hands fascinated: the delicate wrists, the fine bones and slender fingers, the palms just wideContinue readingHands and Gloves","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/h1kYJ-n8k+ZYApgWLWcv1Pa0JKU.json"}

He is too new to know that this is not new, this is habit. He has only been in the world for four months and it has taken him a while to overcome his wonder at the surroundings. Now that he is older he is registering events, processing them, distinguishing between his parents and others, between smells and noises and colours and where they come from. He knows that his walls are blue, and his sheets are yellow and sometimes green. He doesn\u2019t have the names of the shades, of course, but he feels the differences. He knows that the cat doesn\u2019t like him, that he musn\u2019t bite Mummy when he breast-feeds, that Daddy sometimes smells sour-ish in the mornings and that when Mummy cries he musn\u2019t join in because she cries harder and for longer and doesn\u2019t feed him.\nWhen Daddy has gone and Mummy takes him into the kitchen, sits at the table and lifts her shirt so he can feed, he looks up into her face. He sees the dark patch around one eye shift and change, into purple then green then pink. Then one day there is a new patch, on the other side of her face, below the eye, and that changes colours too. If he touches it with his hand, Mummy twitches, says No, no, baby, and covers his fist in hers. And he knows that if he smiles at her after this, if he smiles at her any time Daddy isn\u2019t there, she will stare at him for a moment, and then slowly, slowly, her lips will move and she will do the same back to him and then she will hold him so tightly and whisper into his ear, We\u2019ll leave, next week, I\u2019ll pack and we\u2019ll go to Grandma\u2019s.

I often tense and stand still, listening, in the kitchen or on the stairs, and last night I heard you, your moth-light fumbling near my door. Why so timid, love? You\u2019ve seen the landscape of my heart: open sand stretching beyond the eye, a dry coast awaiting the flood of your arrival. Your steps should be bolder by now.\nYou come bright-eyed and eloquent, flushed with your latest passion, filming sorrow or outrage no one wants to see. How I love you that way, aflame and high-minded, needing to talk and be touched, and so we fill the night, garrulous and indignant as a mad king and queen, before plunging into the surf that tumbles warm along the ocean\u2019s edge. Come morning, you\u2019re gone. Gone too the water that hissed and trembled beneath us, gone the tight-bubbled foam that frothed along our limbs, sparkling in starlight as the tide peaked and you arched to pull me deeper.\nMy skin feels stiff, crusted and taut. I throw off the blankets, see I\u2019m mapped with white roads, wayward as seacoasts and raised like miniature dunes, glistening here and there, tiny gems flashing in a sun spear of the new day. You and your gentle heart\u2014you\u2019ve left me the salt.\nThey only sting a little, but those white roads will redden; the pain will grow keener. I sit up, brush the salt onto paper, which I curl and tap softly, spilling it into my blue pillbox. Our salt of earth and skin, so precious and potent I lift it to my tongue with a feathered dab of moistened fingertip, tasting crystals so few my fingers outnumber them.\n\u201cHow much longing can you live with?\u201d you once asked, but I couldn\u2019t answer your question. Longing\u2019s simply a fact, like air. As soon as our eyes can make sense of the light, we reach for the kitten or the candle flame. Soft, glittery, filthy, scalding\u2014we want it all. Longing aches so deep in our genes, some build huts in the depths of forests, seek caves in the bare stone of mountaintops, there to live blind, to hear no whispers, to smell only wind, taste dust, touch no one.\n\u201cHow can you let her go,\u201d people sometimes ask, \u201cif you love her that much?\u201d\nI tell them how hard it is. But of course I let you go, and always will. I love you for your wings, not your shoes.\nAbove the clouds today, you\u2019ll ride the sky. Will you perhaps see an ocean instead, flowing tranquil and blue to the very curve of the world? So much calmer than the tide that rushed toward us, then covered us, last night.\nI\u2019ll rejoice every time you come to me. I\u2019ll take what you give me, taste you whenever I can. When you\u2019re gone, I\u2019ll take what you leave me, reach for our salt, and taste you whenever I must.\nDouglas Campbell\u2018s fiction has appeared in publications such as Many Mountains Moving, The Northville Review, Slow Trains Literary Journal, and Short Story America.

She took me to the plot once. We stood in the graveyard, both of us teenagers, our skin smooth and tight over our bones, her hand cool and small in mine. It was fall and the leaves were changing. Most of them were still in the trees, gaudy with their yellows and reds, but some of the brown ones had already fallen and the wind was pushing them around across the graves.\nShe knelt and touched the stone that had her name on it. It was polished granite, very clean. Her birthday was etched in below her name, followed by a dash, then a blank space where her death date would go.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty up here, right?\u201d she said.\nWe were up on a little hill in the southern corner of the graveyard. The woods were deep and full of color to one side and on the other side the tombstones sprouted like petrified tree stumps in every direction. She wanted me to look at these things and smile and tell her that it was a beautiful spot. Instead, I looked at her kneeling there, her hair red and thick down her back, and for a moment I saw that hair dry and brittle and gray, curling stringy out of her dead skull. I saw her eyes sink into their sockets, her face crease and wrinkle like snakeskin. I saw her wither from the inside out inside her coffin, down there where the creeping things sit blind and speechless, down there beneath her polished stone.\nShe and I were young and wouldn\u2019t know each other for long\u2014we never spoke again after high school\u2014but I already knew her life. She could go anywhere, do anything. She could make love to a French poet in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower. She could eat roasted scorpion-on-a-stick on a houseboat in Hong Kong or mother a family of four in Nebraska. Anywhere she went, she would be back here.\n\u201cDo you like it?\u201d she said.\nIn the neighboring plots were stones of her dead great-grandparents and her dead grandfather, and another unfinished one for the still-living grandmother.

I teach for twenty years, off and on. Give me your hand. I hold out my hand and he cradles my thumb between his thumb and forefinger, bounces the hand playfully up and down, taking its weight. To me it seems he has muscles in his fingers. The veins stick out in his forearm, which must be bigger than my bicep. His eyes are small, intense, staring at my hand, staring at me. If you can get hold of the hand, there is much you can do. He twists my arm in a way it shouldn\u2019t go and my whole body drifts toward the bar, a brief shock of pain registering in my elbow before he pulls it back. Or the other way.

They want to steal my bag but I will not let them. All I can do is fight them off, push them away as best I can, keep trying to go forward. I run, I block, push, dodge. He jerks his head one way, makes wild arm movements. I have no control. If I fall down I know they kill me. This goes on for several minutes. Somehow I make it to the end of the tunnel, and I yell. Finally they take off. I make sure that never happen again. He takes another swallow of beer. He nods, as if agreeing with something I\u2019ve said. He steps off his stool and motions with his hands.

Pheromones of night jasmine and ivory frangipani drift from the terrace through open doors. Her soft lips offer the answer just to you, never say never signs from her mouth, and hope takes a seat in the game.\nEarly in the evening, she floats in a blue-tiled pool that dances with plump drops of spring rain. You brush aside her damp hair and supplant the answer with a question on the curve of her neck. Stepping from her pedestal onto the crisp white sheets, she succumbs to the ocean breeze and your Sappho touch. She whispers, how can I live without this. Warm blood flows to thaw a swelling heart and dawn lights your open window. In time you sprawl across the\nmiddle\nof the Ikea bed in her flat off the Fulham Palace Road and talk of love. Around the corner, in the Slug and Lettuce on a Saturday afternoon, you share dry white wine and sparkling words and wet kisses. You walk home, arm-in-arm, and make love until the Sunday papers arrive and sleep long past noon.\nOne summer\u2019s day, you knock on the door holding more than a tooth brush, and lives become one. Your days are full of mingled laundry and laughs of joy, half-empty bottles that clog the bathroom, and cries of anguish. The seasons pass while no one counts.\nOut of the blue on a windy morning, appears breakfast in bed because her fabulous new job begins tomorrow.

He fell, hit his head and they had to operate. They removed part of his skull to relieve the brain swelling.\u201d\nYou walk into the ICU, and you don\u2019t have a clue what to expect. There are four beds in the room, each concealed by a hospital curtain. Four life-and-death stories are being played out behind them. Yours is behind curtain #3.\nYou push the curtain aside, and there he is. But what is he? Asleep? In a coma? Brain dead? The machines that beep, burp and buzz next to him don\u2019t tell you a thing. They speak a language that only doctors and nurses understand. You\u2019re not privy. Another machine hisses at you, telling you, \u201cGo away. You\u2019re too late. I\u2019m breathing for him.

You want to look away, out of respect, to give him a modicum of privacy. There\u2019s no such thing in a hospital, though.\nA breathing tube is taped to his mouth, rammed down his throat. You remember him when he was barely two, baby fat still coiled around his thighs like scrumptious donuts, begging you to take a bite. And the pacifier, like a big, fat cigar, clamped between his perfect cupid\u2019s bow lips.\nHis face is swollen and discolored. It\u2019s smeared with yellows, greens, blues and purples, a painting done by a deranged mind. One eye is swollen shut and buried beneath folds of blue-black flesh. A few metal staples are scattered across his forehead.\nHis head is shaved. Looped across one side of it, from the top of his left ear, up to the top of his crown, and crawling back down his scalp behind the ear, is a giant centipede. You look again, to verify. Jesus Christ, you think, what country, what jungle are we in? What the hell is that? Your mind reels as you look at the hundreds of legs slithering across his scalp like someone, some sadistic madman, has gone off the rails with a staple gun.\nYou\u2019ve seen enough. You pull the curtain closed around him, like a cocoon. You hope that, safe inside, nature will work its miracles and maybe, someday soon, a butterfly will emerge. Maybe not. You leave.\nThe phone rings. It\u2019s no longer an inanimate object. It screams at you like an angry, insistent infant. You resist picking it up, but you know it won\u2019t shut up until you do.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\u201cHey, Kiddo, it\u2019s your bro.

They didn\u2019t know how it happened; no one in the family had ever had skin that wasn\u2019t made of skin before. The doctors said this baby will need to avoid fire and water, but should otherwise be okay. The baby was named Helen, after her grandmother, but her grandmother was afraid to pick her up. The baby\u2019s skin was white white, so white you could see the veins running blue underneath, white like perfect snow, white like sugar, white like the white of the world after you stare at the sun too long. So white that it was hard not to make a mark on her if you were holding a pen.\nI wrote three things on the baby before anyone caught me. I wrote advice to the baby in the crook between her thumb and forefinger, where she would be able to read it if she used a magnifying glass. I wrote a poem down her side, where the people she would love could run their fingers over it. I wrote my three worst secrets on the back of her neck, in between her fine hairs, where she couldn\u2019t see them, but they would be there. I don\u2019t need to repeat them now; they\u2019re out there somewhere.\nHer parents found the words after my second time babysitting, which was the fourth day she was alive.\n\u201dWhy would you do this?\u201d my friend asked, pointing at the baby\u2019s side. \u201cIt won\u2019t come off. This skin is paper.\u201d She paused and cleared her throat. Her skin turned red, her eyes filled up. \u201cI would never ever do this to your baby.\u201d\nMy friend\u2019s husband rubbed on the words to see if the ink would come up, but he just tore the baby\u2019s skin. The baby cried out loud, a scream that ran up and down my spine. \u201cFuck,\u201d the baby\u2019s father said, and put a piece of tape over the tear.\n\u201dI just wanted to leave a mark, you know? Put something out there that I knew would last longer than I would.\u201d I reached out to touch the baby\u2019s arm but my friend jerked her away.\n\u201dFuck you, she\u2019s not yours to leave a mark on. That\u2019s for us to do, not you.\u201d My friend took the baby upstairs and her husband pushed me softly to the door. \u201cI wrote on her, too, under her toes,\u201d he whispered to me. \u201cSomeone comes along that special, you have to do something.\u201d\nWe stood on the porch for a minute and blinked at the darkness together. The stars here are not very bright, and it\u2019s hard to make out any constellations. You just have to be satisfied with the knowledge, my father once said to me, that you\u2019re in the universe with everyone else, stars or no stars.

I grab her bags and hold her hand. When we get to her apartment building, she lets go and shows me how she can use the rail to walk up and down the stairs, just like her doctor ordered. For exercise. Her knobby fingers wrap around the thin metal bar; one foot at a time, she climbs the stairs. On the way down she goes sideways, a clenched hand with blue veins shooting around like rivers on a map, the other hovering over the bar, pale and limp. She thanks me by putting two avocados in my purse and asks god to bless me with one hundred more beautiful years. I wonder how old she thinks I am. I am forty-five, but I look much younger. Thirty-five? Twenty-five? Eighteen, a bouncer guessed; he probably guessed eighteen to dozens of women each night.\nA man sneaks out of his house and into my apartment, where he pins me down on the bed. He breathes out his nose and half grins, biting his lower lip while my insides heat up with resistance. This is all we do together. Tonight the clocks are pushed back and he arrives early, my reading lamp illuminating half my body. Usually he enters a black room, our shadows tangled on the ceiling. He takes his time noting the path my hips take to my legs, which is the most direct route. Then he puts his knees on my knees and digs into my shoulders with callused fingers. This doesn\u2019t last long. His eyes go to the lit side of my body, and he lets up. \u201cYou\u2019re all bruised,\u201d he says, shifting his weight off me. \u201cWhat do you think we\u2019re doing here?\u201d I say. I should be furious; complete sentences are against the rules. But I am surprised: no matter what I do to it, my body has always been soft, dotted in faint yellows and purples. \u201cMaybe we oughta take a week off,\u201d he says, now one leg hanging off the bed, his palms flattening out my puffy comforter. \u201cYou\u2019re not like me,\u201d I say, reaching for the light, \u201cTry keeping your eyes closed.\u201d He rolls back onto me and digs his fingers into my shoulders deeper than ever \u2013 it feels as if my flesh and muscle are getting crammed into bone and never coming back.\nShe was funny. Made it seem like I rescued a drowning baby from a frozen river. All I did was hold her hand and groceries for a few blocks. She waited at the top of the stairs to make sure I knew which way to go, to catch her breath, and I waited for her, our heads nodding out of respect. When I remember the avocados, it has been days and their insides are brown and mushy and stuck to the lining of my purse.\nMichael Don is an MFA candidate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

They have been so central, and now all Cinderella wants them to do is sing sweetly from the oak trees. Trees? They have built dresses and shoes from clouds and air! They have picked lentils from ash in seconds! They have spoken to princes in songs understandable! These are birds with ambition and she has relegated them to ordinary. In the wee hours of the night, they fly into her bedroom via an open window to remind her, as she sleeps, that they put their beaks directly into the wet eyeballs of her sisters and then pressed until they heard a pop. \u201cDo you know?\u201d they sing, gently, \u201cdo you know what kind of fortitude that takes?\u201d She tosses in her sleep; in the morning, she tells her handsome husband that she is sleeping poorly because she just is not used to such a soft bed. She takes to sleeping on the floor. Sometimes, just to feel normal, she dresses in rags. It\u2019s hard to change so quickly.\nHer sisters live downstairs, in the blind quarters. They hear the birds and know better. \u201cEvil beasts,\u201d they mutter. \u201cDemons.\u201d But the birds don\u2019t like that either. \u201cWe\u2019re not evil,\u201d they chatter to one another. \u201cWe just want a role.\u201d Weeks go by, and Cinderella has taken to helping out in the kitchen, which is causing some friction with her mother-in-law, and the birds just leave, because they are birds, with wings, and can fly. They fly to the next castle over, where a little-known queen and king are trying to figure out a conquest of the territories. The birds consult. They fly over blueprints and reveal all the secrets of Cinderella\u2019s castle and moat. \u201cGo here,\u201d they point, with their beaks. \u201cAnd here.\u201d Then, as soon as the new queen and king head out on horseback to take over Cinderella\u2019s castle, the birds flap back to tell Cinderella. She\u2019s making pea soup in the kitchen, wearing a sack. She listens with big eyes and runs to tell her husband, who makes an announcement to all the inhabitants of the kingdom, who arm up and summon their horses. The birds, faster than any of them, fly back to the other king and queen and with fine aim and diving skills, swoop in and peck out their eyes. Turns out eye-pecking is somewhat addictive for birds. The horses balk and courtiers cry and the whole thing stops and the courtmaidens and soldiers rush to aid their weeping leaders.\nAt home, the birds get medals, which they cannot wear, so hang from tree branches. The king is disappointed that he did not use his new sword.\nThe birds continue to cause trouble only to solve things in the nick of time over the next ten years until they are old birds and have had baby birds with lower expectations.\nAimee Bender is the author of four books, including The Girl in the Flammable Skirt and The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake.

The watchman had already swung shut the heavy gates, and I pulled the cork on the cheap cane rum I`d secured in the square during the heat of the day.\nI had no ice, but with a slice of lemon I could manage to swill the stuff tequila-style. I speared a ripe fruit with my Buck knife and sectioned it neatly into eighths.\nI couldn`t make out the words, but it was clear the mariachis were yelping a bawdy lyric. The girl stepped livelier in the torchlight, lifting her skirts with one hand and swirling about the flagstones. By the time I finished the first lemon, the rum was seeping through my muscles like a tonic, and I ached to join her.\nI plucked a second lemon and sliced it less precisely, then tossed aside the plastic cup and began drinking from the bottle. Deep in the shadows, I was unsure whether the girl was aware that I`d been watching her. If she was, she was being coy about it. She kicked off her sandals and loosened the braid in her hair, letting the knotted end whip at her buttocks. The humid night air and the rum brought beads of sweat to my forehead, and the music filled my veins like a slow-acting hallucinogen. I peeled off my shirt and let the breeze trace feathery hieroglyphs on my chest.\nI drew deeply on the cigar, and she suddenly stopped and faced me. She drew a finger to her swollen lips and mocked me, her cheeks sucked inward as if she were drawing me in. I tipped the bottle back and swallowed deeply, grateful that my night had taken a promising turn. The girl laughed loudly and opened her buttons, jiggling her cleavage in my direction. I flicked the cigar butt aside and beckoned to her, and she opened her arms wide.\nThe music slowed to a dreamy waltz. Out of the shadows below me stepped the watchman, and she floated lightly into his arms. I watched in disbelief as they swayed to the slow, sinuous rhythm, both oblivious to the deluded fool in the shadows above.\nI plucked the third lemon and hurled it hard over the wall. A chattered curse answered from the street below, giving the lovers pause for a brief, distracted moment.\nSteve Frederick is a journalist in Scottsbluff, Nebraska. \u201cLa Luna de los Tres Limones\u201d is his first published fiction.","source":"https:\/\/vestalreview.net\/la-luna-de-los-tres-limones\/","source-hostname":"Vestal Review","excerpt":"by Steve Frederick A cluster of fruit dangled like three moons from the lemon tree outside my balcony.

So few were sent out, just me and Estella in the entire community. They marveled at the honor, the glory, and the chance at life that came with it, but I didn\u2019t marvel with them. I didn\u2019t consider myself so lucky.\nI am a simple guy, with few wants in life. Enough to eat and a safe place to sleep and I will be content; if I might be so blessed as to be loved I will never ask for more. And by some miracle love found me, before I\u2019d even thought to ask for it. Her name is Gabrielle, though I always call her Gabby. I\u2019ll never forget the day we met. We were only children then, the tall summer grasses coming up to our bellies, ticklish. Her family had just come from the south, the fields dry with drought. I was shy, but she was friendly; she came and found me and invited me, or rather dragged me, out to play. I remember she challenged me to a race to the chestnut tree and she finished in half my time and I swore I\u2019d be faster than her before a year was out and she laughed. We quickly became friends, and stayed friends as we grew up, until that fateful autumn evening when we were in the wildflowers, watching the first stars come out, and she leaned her head on my shoulder, and we both knew there was something more.\nWe have two children now, and they\u2019re growing up strong. Gabby and I lead our little family together, traveling when food becomes scarce, and fighting when we need to. The land is fertile here and the predators few, and those few have mostly learned to leave us alone. I love my family, and I love my life. I cannot imagine myself happier than I am now. Why, then, should I answer this summons? Married by appointment to the cold, heartless Estella, my beloved Gabby gone from my life forever? Why should I consent to this?\nBecause she will be gone anyway, is why. In a few hours, it will all be gone. Everything I know, everyone I know, all the world will be gone. Save Estella and myself, assuming I go. The two of us, and all the other pairs, chosen by whoever sent these summonses as the best, the brightest, the most beautiful of our kind, to live on in misery while all those we care for die. All at the behest of some unknown being, claiming command over our life and death to some unknown purpose.\nThe rain is falling, Gabby tells me; you must go. Let them go, I tell her, I want no life without you. She smiles at me, a happy-but-sad smile, and leans her head against me, and our horns touch.

She took along a small bouquet of roses, white ones, and laid them on the grass in front of the headstone. Knowing she needed this time alone, I waited by the car and smoked a cigarette. I fully admit that I was indifferent to her plight, but I had no desire to upset her further, and so kept myself at a distance where I would not have to become involved.\nThe person who died I did not know. But to Marianne it was someone important, which I guess made her important to me. It was sunny and cold, and a breeze made Marianne\u2019s long, blonde hair swirl and dance like the clouds of smoke I pushed from my lips. It was the only thing distinguishing her from one of the monuments: she stood perfectly erect, head bowed, hands clasped in front of her waist. Dressed all in black\u2013the heels and the stockings, the peacoat and beret\u2013she seemed only more pale.\nAn hour passed that way, but I was not impatient with her. The cemetery was not unappealing to me: aesthetically, I had the deepest appreciation for it. The exactness of the monuments, the obvious care that went into their making, from the grandest mausoleum to the most modest grave marker, spoke of a sincerity that had seemingly disappeared from our lives. It had retreated here, to a place where cynicism could never intrude, where the source of all our dread and bitter joys was memorialized, spreading out beyond the edge of sight, in every direction, to a place my eyes could not reach.\nWhen the sun had fallen lower, filtered gold through the bows of the oak trees that dotted the grounds, I summoned the courage to speak Marianne\u2019s name. But she made no answer, and I could see then that she was already too far gone, that no matter what I said or how I pleaded, she was simply not ready to leave. Perhaps she would never be ready. Coming up behind her, I leaned in and kissed her one last time on the cheek. Her eyes remained fixed on the headstone as I got in the car and drove away, leaving her to recede in the rearview mirror.\nRandall DeVallance is a writer living in Pittsburgh, PA.

Foot\nWe sit side by side on the unused bed in my room, a week after we first met. Already, all I want is to ask him questions, always. I noticed that when he swims, he wears his red and black converse sneakers. Yesterday, the grey sky settled on the bottom of his shoes as he dove with his legs sticking straight up into the air. Now, I can ask him why. When I ask, he lifts his foot and points at a little notch of raised skin. Once, some creature stung him at the bottom of the ocean, so now the darkness of the water scares him. In the middle of an Alaskan bay, he guarded his feet from sea urchins.\n2. Hand\nI trace the circle of a scar that sits on the skin between his forefinger and his thumb. And this one? \u201cThat one,\u201d he says. He was driving with a friend, driving nowhere in particular. She mentioned that she always dreamed of branding someone with those cigarette lighters that come in cars. He offered up his hand as a sacrifice. She left her mark; it hurt like hell. I can understand why he let her do it; that\u2019s one of the things we have in common. In some ways, this annoys him\u2014that I can relate, that I didn\u2019t gasp in horror. \u201cYou remind me of an Alder tree,\u201d he blurts. \u201cYou grow anywhere, even where there\u2019s no soil for roots to take hold.\u201d\n3. Wrist\nI\u2019m still holding his hand, looking at his bowed head, at his tousled brown hair, and smelling his smell, a mixture of cinnamon and sweat. Something tells me to flip over his hand, so I listen to this ancient call and I discover a mountain range raised up along his wrist. I try to touch it, but our atoms repel one another. When? I ask. \u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d he says. How could he forget that kind of blood? But then again, if I look into his eyes on a night like this, maybe I could believe him. In the morning, I thought, Damn, those eyes are beautiful. But at night, I remember where that gold comes from, that his eyes are the color of fireball whiskey.\n4. \u2026\u2026..\nHe pulls his hands from my grasp and cups my face. \u201cI don\u2019t like to hold hands anymore,\u201d he whispers. I feel cold. I picture myself as a little girl building a snowman with my mom. How did I end up here, older now, sitting next to him? He was once a child too. But this moment feels inevitable, planned. And in this moment, I\u2019m content to be another scar. His lips hug mine. His lips teach my lips that kisses and words are interchangeable, that some are less true than others.\nAmanda Gain graduated from Loyola University Chicago with a B.A. in English.

He was wearing his running shoes, a t-shirt and shorts. She could imagine him pounding the pavement, the sweat dripping from his hair, the iPod buds in his ears. He would play Aerosmith and the Rolling Stones while he ran, all those musicians so much older but so much more alive than he was. She laughed at this, too. Charlie Watts was even older than her father-in-law, and they both were still alive, gray-haired and breathing.\nShe laughed and laughed as she pulled out the half-empty bottle of Gatorade that was held upright between his thighs.

It\u2019s a flash, an image. I cup my hand over my eyes, but she is gone\u2014a mirage.\nNext outing, bitter cold, the trudge up Arcadia Road is arduous. Murphy\u2019s fur ripples against his flanks in the wind. I wonder, for the millionth time, how different life might be, had the child been born. I shiver with cold and my dark thoughts.\n\u201cBetter take a quick whiz, Murph,\u201d I say. The wind shakes the trees, making a whooshing eerie rustle. The dawn skies are flat and gray.\nOn the road an injured wren huddles, motionless. I hold Murphy back as I swoop it up. It struggles only a little. I move it gently to the grassy shoulder where it sits, immobile, while my mind battles between leaving it to survive in nature, or taking it home. Murphy\u2019s interest has been captured by a movement in the trees.\nThe baby appears again in the fir. No mistake. She is perched naked and rosy on an outer limb. The tight curls of her hair are honey-colored, and her face dimples with mirth as she waves her tiny fist.\nIt begins in my chest, and explodes in my ears, filling my mouth and nose. My head rings with the screech of wind and cries that must be born in my own constricted throat.\nFor years I\u2019ve wondered what she\u2019d look like, this child of mine. She gaily waves and I lift my hand in response, as if our fluttering fingers spin a thread, forever connecting us. She waits, I now know.\nThe vision of her fades in and out of the dappled foliage of the woods.\nAt my feet, the bird takes a few faltering steps, and I swipe my wet face with the sleeve of my parka. When I look back, the empty branches, heavy with needles, sway, waving.\nThe wren lifts off in a dazed and haphazard little circle. Then, buoyed by wind, it soars up into the trees.","source":"https:\/\/vestalreview.net\/the-dead\/","source-hostname":"Vestal Review","excerpt":"by Beverly Jackson We walk every morning, our pace well suited\u2014old dog and old woman\u2014a leash uniting us in silent journeys downContinue readingThe Dead","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/Q1yu0w9ZwF3uFnZltHr9umuw4tA.json"}

It is indifferent to what it carries, unburdened equally by flowers, or corpses, or shit. Some girls wade in up to their waists, calling out names when a face is recognized. It\u2019s routine now, just another chore, like grinding millet or weeding the garden.\nIt looks like the rebels visited the village a few kilometers away, walking in at dawn, just as families were stirring. They might not have heard about it for days, but the river doesn\u2019t wait to bring them the news. They spend their lives learning this lesson\u2014of the remorseless strength of the river\u2019s pull; of the slow, unrelenting current carrying everything down to the sea.\nForgetfulness is easy to come by. The bush creeps in to erase the burned traces of homes; the red bus that used to stop there will soon drive by without slowing down. A bride stands on the shore, pretty in her western-style dress, gripping her flowers tightly. To her it feels like any other small catastrophe\u2014a drunken argument between relatives, an inopportune rain shower\u2014impossible to predict, nobody\u2019s fault. The minister does not falter as, behind the wedding party, the flotilla of death drifts by.\nPain comes in drips; grief is paid in installments. On the bank of the river, the boys stop fishing out of fear of snagging a corpse, snapping a line, losing a hook. They jostle and push each other, roughhousing until the water is clear again. They have even stopped rejoicing that it wasn\u2019t them, that they have another day next to the stoic river, that once again they have been left alone to die in their own time.\nOld men sit drinking bitter coffee, trading gossip. The shop girl brings them napkins and a few bits of news. It\u2019s all the same, intrigue and betrayal told in cheap bits, each new detail burying the last. Colonel Tsiba declared himself a prince and was murdered by his officers. The AFC split from the ARC; the FNL joined the PLF. Nobody knows how it will turn out, except that it always turns out the same way. They used to mark the spots with small wooden crosses, but that ambition has long left them. These days, communion is served with a nine-millimeter round, and everyone dies for someone else\u2019s sins.\nFear swells the heart; it begins to feel like love. Where there is no tenderness, brute force will do. The wedding ends with another minor disaster. The bride\u2019s veil has blown away, skipping mischievously down to the river. The minister, ever gallant, volunteers to retrieve it. The wedding party watches with trepidation, afraid that he might slip in the mud and ruin his best suit. Like a heron, he picks his way toward the veil, stepping carefully over the dead.","source":"https:\/\/vestalreview.net\/the-pull-of-the-river\/","source-hostname":"Vestal Review","excerpt":"By John Haggerty The river, where its surface can be seen, is a muddy brown.

The second child, repulsed by external demands, pushes his crayon past the lines, appends the shapes, finds forms within forms, births a certain wildness heretofore unseen. The third child does not color at all. She has become distracted by the softness of her crayon, its hint of liquescence in the heat of the sun.

Is it the one who heeds the given, who tries to forge a brightness in limitude? Or is it the one who voyages beyond?

Cheryl gave James a blow job when they fooled around again an hour after the panty stain, just like she gave Tom at that Christmas party and Steve at the beach. Tom also rubbed his dick between her round, wet breasts (he\u2019d poured Chardonnay between them); Steve stuck his fingers so far up inside her, she remembered her next doctor\u2019s appointment. All of them licked her and rubbed her and squeezed the cheeks of her ass. They did everything they could think of\u2014after all, they weren\u2019t inhibited\u2014everything except fuck.\nThe laundry room is empty now. Cheryl lifts the gray silk panties from the small pile of delicates and holds them to her face. She tries to smell James, tries to remember the thrilling skip of her breath when he reached for her hand beneath the table, tries to remember the look in his eyes she thought meant he wanted her. As in really. Cheryl breathes deeply, and though the panties smell more like the musty bottom of her bathroom hamper than anything else, she remembers James\u2019 skin. She remembers her face pressed into his neck when he told her that she couldn\u2019t spend the night. And when at last she tosses the gray silks into the washing machine, another stain has blotted out the first.\nMaryanne Stahl lives on a lake in metro Atlanta with her husband, son and a variety of other animals. She does not own any gray silk panties. Her first novel, Pool of Light, will be published by New American Library (Penguin-Putnam) in fall 2001.","source":"https:\/\/vestalreview.net\/new-millennium-sex\/","source-hostname":"Vestal Review","excerpt":"by Maryanne Stahl No one wants to fuck Cheryl anymore.

He crosses himself, a half-forgotten gesture he once knew well, picks up the broken girl from the tiled floor and carries her to her bed.

We talked pleasantly of old times, and it wasn\u2019t until we stood to go that Nemos spoke of his parents.\nWhen the old couple were too feeble to care for themselves, Nemos and his wife had brought them down from the mountain and into their home, not dreaming of any trouble. The couple had been pious and respected all their lives, but taking them away from the village of their birth seemed to have been a mistake. Nemos could not remember a time when they had ever raised their voices at one another, but now in their son\u2019s house they warred constantly. Whether the window should be open, how strong to make the coffee, whether the bed should be made with the pillows on top of the coverlet or underneath\u2014all manner of trivia were matters for loud and bitter contention all day long. Even with the door of his office shut, Nemos would hear their voices at the back of the house. He found it hard to concentrate on the medical articles he was editing. But what could he do? His sister and brothers were all unsuitable as care givers. He resigned himself to his fate.\nThere came an afternoon when his wife was out on some errand and Nemos went into the kitchen to make his lunch. Much nearer to his parents\u2019 room, he could hear not only their voices, but their words.

I lay with every man I wanted while you tended the grapes. She began to name them. Six names. A dozen. Then Nemos heard his father begin to shout the names of village women he claimed to have had in the vineyard. They went at this, shouting names back and forth, recounting the intimate attributes of their supposed lovers, saying names that Nemos had not heard for years, going house by house through all the nearby families, falling silent only after Nemos, embarrassed at the thought that they might come discover him, had crept back to his office. He could not believe any part of their confessions had been true, but after that day and for several years until his father died and his mother followed a month after, there was peace in his house.","source":"https:\/\/vestalreview.net\/tertsa\/","source-hostname":"Vestal Review","excerpt":"by Bruce Holland Rogers During our visit to Crete we stopped by the home of our old friend Nemos in Tertsa.

The tree was rooted in sand. Nobody tended its leaves, which dragged like a dirty beard. Rain had fallen twice that year.\n\u201cWhy do you think it\u2019s still alive?\u201d I asked my husband one day.\nHe shrugged, saying, \u201cWho knows? Everything\u2019s crazy in Dubai. Why should a tree be any different?\u201d\nWe kept to ourselves; busy grieving for dead relatives. We could not afford to go home for the funerals. Every day, I looked out my bedroom window. A mosque stood about two hundred yards behind Crooked Old Man. Five times a day, the muezzin called out for prayer. The calls resounded, filling the air. At times it seemed as if they shook the tree\u2019s leaves, which grew oilier and larger with time. They shone; defying drought, abandon, the yellow sand. I cursed it. \u201cIf you died, it would be acceptable at your age,\u201d I said, thinking of my aunt who had died at forty-three.\nMy husband did not know the night she died, I snuck out with a kitchen knife. I walked to the tree and stabbed its trunk, but the blade curved. Angry, I yanked its leaves, surprised milky discharge did not leak from its veins. Sweaty from the heat, I returned to our flat and flung the knife in the bin.\nThe next morning, I rescued the knife and tried to straighten the tip with a hammer. The noise ricocheted off the ceramic walls. I kept at it all morning, but dents pockmarked the blade. My ears hummed. I hated the tree for ruining my good knife.\nWhen the midday call for prayer sounded, I squinted, trying to catch a glimpse of the muezzin, but Crooked Old Man got in the way, blocking the minaret. I only saw the mosque\u2019s dome, looking white and blurred, like a mirage.\nYet from the corner of my eye, I saw a herd of goats approaching. Rhythmic, pounding the sand into clouds, they surrounded the tree. Some jumped on branches and grazed on the leaves. I laughed. Stupid tree, I thought, let\u2019s see how you survive this. The tree answered, waving its branches like a complaint.\nI watched the goats eat the tree. By late afternoon, little was left. Shredded bark. Yellow sapless wounds. Branches like twigs. Leaves like feathers.\nThe evening call for prayer began, bottomless, solemn, rumbling in the sky. I don\u2019t know why I ran to save the tree then. Panicked, I rushed through a crowd of men traveling to the mosque. I tripped over their robes but carried on, hearing their laughter follow me to the sand plot. Screaming and flailing my arms, I bounded into the herd, but the goats only jumped a bit. Their mouths stuffed, they seemed to mock me as the men had. I embraced the tree\u2019s trunk, feeling its torn bark scratch my cheek. Realizing it was too late; I held on tightly and wept.\nTrained in Fine Arts and Education, Zett Aguado found her true calling four years ago when she wrote her first short story.

Their eyes lose their faded gray and turn blue.\n\u201cAfterward, they made us go to the camp. I thought I\u2019d seen everything when I was in Stuttgart and I had to put identity tags on the bombing victims. I was twelve then, and I had to get up every morning and collect handfuls of tags from the woman in charge of our section. I was trembling inside, but I didn\u2019t dare show it. I\u2019d been raised from birth not to show the slightest fear.\u201d\n\u201cHa! You think I don\u2019t know that? I was put in the same mold and pressed out like a little cheese. I followed orders without the slightest hesitation because I never once truly heard what was being said. I was like a dog. Does he truly know what the word \u201cSit!\u201d means? Someone could train him to react to the word \u201cWrite!\u201d and the dog would still crouch. We were trained to react, not to think.\u201d\n\u201cIs that your excuse?\u201d\n\u201cMy heavens! How do you think that I lived all these years? I walked through the concentration camp, too. I held my hankie over my face and I refused to look. A soldier tore it out of my hands. His face was the most terrible face I\u2019d ever seen, all black, with lightning flashing from his eyes. I was fifteen and thought that it was the devil himself.\u201d\n\u201cI want to stop talking about it.\u201d\n\u201cMy mother fainted. I heard a thump, and I turned around to see her lying on the ground. I thought that the black devil would kill her, but he picked her up, slapped her cheek until she came around, and pushed her back into line.\u201d\n\u201cI wish we could stop talking about this.\u201d\nSilence. The women shrink, their hair turns white and their backs hump into the stoop of old age. A voice speaks from behind them. It says, \u201cWhere you go next will depend on your answers. Did you realize what was happening to the neighbors who disappeared?\u201d\nThe women look at each other.\n\u201cOf course I knew,\u201d says one. \u201cWe all knew about it. No one said anything aloud, but we knew. The smell was borne on the wind. That\u2019s all I have to say.\u201d\nJennifer Macaire is an American living in France.

Late at night, when the carnival music played slightly out of key, the kissing-booth woman brushed flecks of the booth\u2019s red paint from her forearms, flicked the hook and brought the shutter down. The booth would open again the next morning. She never missed. Even when she was sick, she\u2019d be there, leaning forward on the counter, her nose rubbed pink from tissues and her lips chapped and peeling under her lipgloss. Kisses were at a discount on those days, two dollars instead of three.\nShe kept a jar on the counter for payment. Teenage boys stumbled forward, the bills squeezed in their hands like wilted bouquets, and the blush on their necks making a dash for their chins.\n\u201cUm\u2026can I?\u201d the shy ones stammered.\nOr, if the boy was cocky, his bills would be crisp, and he\u2019d say, \u201cGive me.\u201d\nThe kissing-booth woman rested her fingers under their jaws where, no matter how fearless they\u2019d acted, their pulses fluttered like caught moths. The boys tasted the same, all of them. Maybe it was something in the milk of the city\u2019s cows that made them taste this way\u2014like butter slightly turned. She gave her nicest kisses to the shy boys, figuring the braggarts would like it better if they felt she was holding a little back.\nOne slow afternoon when the tilt-a-wheel had broken and tipped, leaving its riders dangling and waiting for a tall ladder, the teenage boys\u2019 mothers marched up to the kissing booth accompanied by a minister and a list of signatures. The mothers looked like their sons only older and more pinched. The kissing booth woman matched them up by faces and was amused to find that the shy boys had cocky mothers, and the cocky boys had shy ones. The shyest boy\u2019s mother slammed the list of signatures on the counter and began to yell about youth and lips and some man named God.\nThe kissing-booth woman laid hands on the mother\u2019s pinched cheeks and drew her in. The other mothers gasped, the shy ones clamping their hands to their mouths, the cocky ones balling their fists on their hips. The minister swept off his funny black hat, drew it over his chest, and worked his mouth in a series of dry prayers.\nAs they kissed, the mother\u2019s pulse beneath her fingers was brave and fine, like the hoof-beats of a horse she had ridden as a little girl. Her breath tasted of cloves. The kissing-booth woman was not surprised when the mother opened her mouth and, for a moment, let her tongue slip in. Only after the funny black hat had floated to the ground did she release the mother, who smiled shyly and paused before pulling away, giving the kissing-booth woman time to whisper in her scrubbed shell of an ear, \u201cThis is the life for you.\u201d\nKatie Williams has been published in Indiana Review, Subtropics, Austin Chronicle, and has a story forthcoming from Prairie Schooner.","source":"https:\/\/vestalreview.net\/the-kissing-booth\/","source-hostname":"Vestal Review","excerpt":"By Katie Williams All day her lips received kisses\u2014pecks, smacks, presses and startling suctions.

He looked out the side window, so black it revealed no out, only a reflection of in.\nI stood and walked over to his side, careful not to look at the darkened pane. I slowly pulled the cigarette out of his altered and needy hands, then I placed it upon his soiled desk and rolled it gently while he watched. He started his third person narration. He said, now don\u2019t get upset, you have been a joy, and Lawrence will always remember who helped him through a difficult time. He continued watching the cigarette. It was growing longer, thicker, as I rolled it over and over. The color changed to a pale pink. I could feel the texture, like dough under my palms.

It will kill you dead, and thus you may want to have a party, an after-rain soiree that includes close examination of the ground, just for this purpose, and you should invite all the people in the world that you hate.\nMathis, your death angels are springing forth from the ground even as we speak. The rain falls from the sky, travels in runnels down the leaves of the huge spreading oak in your yard, drops onto the acidic soil, and grows. Overnight it will become as big as a garden rock, but right now it is a tiny fillip of fiber, so small you will need a flashlight and tweezers to find it. Your wife says the same thing about you when she yaks with her friends. She is the first person you invite.\nThe second person you invite is Matty, your best friend, your wife\u2019s lover. You imagine that Matty and Mathis are close enough in the ear-breathy sex-syllabics that when your wife moans in pleasure under one or the other of you, whatever name she mutters is okay by whomever.\nMatty likes cars and psilocybin and women, not necessarily in that order, so he is unpleasantly tight when he arrives late, pupils dilated\u2014dreamy and fulsome and annoying\u2014chattering in his Carlos-Castaneda-used-car-salesman way about his \u201969 Camaro. It shines redly in the slick of water pouring from the sky. Matty goes over and takes your wife by the elbow and leads her to the corner of your deck, where the rain drips down onto her neck. She squeals all girly-like and you wish you had two of her to introduce to more friends, so that they all could know how good you have it.\nThe third person you invite is your mother, and the last your father, so as to get the Oedipals out of the way.\nThree is a magic number, says the children\u2019s ditty. You\u2019ve included one to grow on.\nDeath is not the end, Mathis, but it\u2019s a good start, you think, and it is time now to search the lawn for these puffballs of doom, these little white shrooms, and you are on your knees in the deep wet of your unmowed lawn, the smell of grass and dirt in your nostrils, and your own fate in the trowel you hold, digging.\nRusty Barnes cofounded and edits Night Train.

A bloated brunette appeared in the paper under the headline: Woman Pregnant with Unidentified Object. I read it with my sister, whose own empty uterus kept her balled up on the sofa. Six months later, the headline read: Woman Gives Birth to Diamond Watch. By then, the strange pregnancies were everywhere.\nWhile the details remained mysterious, scientists and poets agreed that reproduction had become divorced from sex, and now required only love. In the best cases, the things were small: a handful of fabric-covered buttons, a pair of jade earrings. But sometimes there was danger. A zookeeper in Montreal nearly died giving birth to a pair of Bengal tigers.\n\u201cAren\u2019t they beautiful?\u201d my sister said, watching the cubs on the evening news.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cWe have to be careful now.\u201d\nI averted my eyes, focusing on a brass lamp I had never liked. We were all learning to be careful. New courses on \u201cSafe Love\u201d were added to the high school curriculum when a rash of teen pregnancies swelled little girls up with bean bag toys and pop CDs. \u201cNot looking for love?\u201d advertisers asked. \u201cBuy this fair-to-middling book.\u201d \u201cListen to our special mix of mediocre music.\u201d\nWe kept our heads down. We quieted our feelings. We pulled back our wandering hands, put down forks.\nExcept my sister. One morning I walked in on her staring at a picture of her ex-husband, Alex, whispering, \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\u201cStop!\u201d I yelled. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I love Alex as much as those women love touch-screen cell phones?\u201d She gestured to the birth announcements in the open paper.\nI left. I wanted to help, but it was too risky to talk about love.\nDoctors stopped looking for solutions. We learned not to love. Our flat bellies became a sign of our self-control. There were abortions, lots of them. At first, they were mostly for big things: palm trees, piles of fresh laundry, rocking chairs. But more and more women decided that the discomfort of pregnancy wasn\u2019t worth it for a piece of fried chicken. There were still a few girls with strange shapes in their bellies and shame on their faces.\nFinally, after five years, the number of object births dwindled almost to nothing.\nMy sister was one of the last. She became pregnant with a set of antique sugar spoons, like the ones our grandmother had. They jangled inside of her, poking her when she moved. Only when she lay on her right side did they nest quietly inside one another.\nI waited in the hospital as she gave birth. They were small spoons; there wasn\u2019t much pain. She showed them to me after the doctor rinsed them off\u2014eight in all. Their scalloped edges gleamed in the flat hospital light.\nNow she keeps them in a box in the attic. I polish them once a year so she doesn\u2019t have to.\nAubrey Hirsch holds an MFA in Creative Writing from the University of Pittsburgh.

It didn\u2019t matter that some ideas were tiny, like pebbles, because he valued them as well. No idea, he thought, was too small.\nOne fine day, as he counted his ideas until he could no longer keep track of how many he counted, Yerkovitz lost his balance\u2014I think it was on Twenty-third Street where this occurred\u2014and fell face forward onto the pavement. It was a hard fall and he cracked his skull. As a result, his ideas, every one of them, instantly jumped out of his head and began bouncing down the street like so many red rubber balls.\nPeople to the left and right of him, seeing what happened, froze in amazement. Others, full of envy and wishing they possessed some of the ideas, ran hurriedly after them and tried to claim them for their own. When the ideas, all of a sudden, started going in different directions, heading this way and that, some people became confused. They didn\u2019t know which idea to run after first. If a person was lucky enough to catch up with one, it was often to no avail, as some of the ideas were not so easy to grasp and, once picked up, would very quickly slip out of the person\u2019s hands.\nOne idea, which bounced all the way down Sixth Avenue and came to a rest on Thirteenth Street, appeared to be the biggest, most coveted of all. It was truly incredible, as anyone could see. Though it looked heavy, it was the essence of lightness. A few close friends of Yerkovitz\u2019s\u2014at least those he recognized, perhaps mistakenly, as his close friends\u2014got to the idea first and fought viciously over it. They yelled at each other, pushed and shoved, and before long their anger escalated into a huge brawl. In the midst of it, they failed to perceive that the idea, jostled in the melee, bounced away, down one street and then another, and then another after that, until it disappeared altogether. No one ever found out where it went.\nYerkovitz, meanwhile, who was in bad shape, was taken to a local hospital, where doctors worked on him day and night. Although he received the best medical treatment available, and eventually recovered from his head wounds completely, he never had a single idea again.\nDennis Pahl is a professor of English at Long Island University.

The millstone led the way down. It was a beautiful day, even below the river, with sunlight daubing everything as if to hold this moment forever: pebbles, moss, darting shapes. The stone tumbled along the floor, kicking up sand that bloomed brown and flowed past my eyes. It rolled a foot or so and then stood, tilted slightly against the strong current but refusing to topple. I was bound in a fetal position, pressed warmly on all sides, attached to the millstone with the light at my back. It was like being in the womb again.\nHey millstone, I said. Where were you born?\nThe millstone said nothing.\nWhen will you die? I asked.\nThe millstone refused to answer.\nWhat have you done all your life? I persisted. What did you do before you were a millstone? Were you part of a great mountain? Were there monsters? Ancient skeletons in your womb?\nLight speckled the millstone, giving it a curious expression. But it didn\u2019t move. My hair, I noticed, was flowing behind me, as if it still believed I was falling.\nO millstone, were you sad when you were separated from the land that birthed you? Or was it an exciting new life? Was it a smaller existence or a freer one, or both?\nThe millstone listed slightly to the left. What this meant I couldn\u2019t tell.\nDid you crush the grain because they forced you to, or was it something you took joy in? Do you feel any guilt at all about your life? Is this the first time you\u2019ve ever killed anybody? Would you like to make confession?\nFrom its silence, the millstone implied that it would not.\nAnd when you\u2019re done with me, where do you go next? What does the future hold?\nThe millstone shuddered\u2014or perhaps that was my eyes growing weak from lack of air\u2013but declined to answer directly. I thrashed a little so I could face upwards, toward the light, as the weight of a riverful of water rushed past my face and the universe, which had once seemed so expansive, narrowed to a tunnel that grew darker and darker, until all I could feel was the tether from the millstone, tight against my belly, tense and eager for release.\nDavid Ellis Dickerson is a regular contributor to \u201cThis American Life\u201d and the creator of the YouTube series \u201cGreeting Card Emergency,\u201d which has led to a lot of interviews on public radio (Weekend Edition, Studio 360, Talk of the Nation, et al.)

Natural and forceful, but purposeful and somehow right. It\u2019s the only way we can remember stories, she says, with pieces fitting together neatly and following the rules of behavior and decorum.\nThat\u2019s not the only way the story happens, not in those other universes.\nIn one of the universes I don\u2019t live in, the woodcutter makes plenty of dough and no one winds up in an oven. There\u2019s one in which the man\u2019s wife doesn\u2019t die; or the children\u2019s stepmother doesn\u2019t hate children; or she does, but she seethes alone and never acts on it. Eventually, her bile consumes her from the inside out.\nIn one universe, far away from here, the cranky old woman never takes up residence in an old cottage, never decorates with gingerbread.\n\u201cOthers are grisly,\u201d the woman tells me. She talks about the one where a bear devours the abandoned children under a full moon. In another, the bear gobbles up Hansel, leaving Gretel to wander alone in madness, wondering Why me? And vice-versa. There\u2019s one where the children are deranged, where they misunderstand the crone\u2019s intentions. They\u2019re tried for murder but hang themselves before the sentencing. There\u2019s one, mostly like the original, where the old lady just can\u2019t get the damn fire started and runs out of matches. Gretel runs for help, but then she can\u2019t find the cottage again and never saves her brother, whom she left in the cage.\n\u201cAgain with the mad wandering,\u201d says the soapbox, street-level pseudophysicist as she shakes her mop of hair.\nShe says we\u2019d never remember the damned siblings if they hadn\u2019t won in the end. \u201cSure, sure,\u201d she says, flapping her hands, as if she\u2019s reciting something, \u201cday to day, we devour the savory details and illogic of local news stories, devoid of sense, but those stories don\u2019t stick. It\u2019s only the ones with a sensical ending that we tell to our children, and they to theirs, and so on and so forth to the infinitudes of time.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the probability,\u201d she rasps, bringing it home, \u201cthat the story happens the way you know it? It\u2019s so close to zero that it might as well be zero.\n\u201cSo there,\u201d she says. \u201cYour damned Hansel and Gretel is impossible.

In this moment, the shark catches a glimpse of the dark water chopping below, but between the crests sees himself in murky geometric glimpses that are constantly moving and disappearing as the water recollects, expands, and thrusts upward again\nThis is death, the shark thinks happily, seeing the glimmering stars through his flat black eyes, feeling numbness. He is a night song of gaping white speed. He imagines he can hear the gulls crying as they fly from their disturbed sanctuaries, water dripping from wings, calls curdling the sensitive jelly canals he uses to detect electrical fields when he isn\u2019t leaping out of the water.\nBut the shark cannot hear the gulls as they truly sound, and cannot fly.\nThe shark falls.\nHe scans.\nIt is an automatic process, seeking the electricity generated by other predators or prey.\nIn his head, in the jelly sacs preceding his brain, the shark instantly registers and dismisses hundreds of signals. The shark is skimming under the surface of the water, preparing to dive down to build the speed for one last jump when he feels It, and he straightens out to a flat cruise at the moment when only a skin of water separates him from the moon.\nHe feels it again.\nThere is another creature, something that does not move in any way that he understands. The shark knows by the electricity in muscle contractions that it is struggling.\nIt feels far away yet, perhaps only a memory freshly stirred from the shark\u2019s encounter with death.\nPerhaps wishful thinking. Perhaps.\nBecause the shark never sleeps, he dreams while he swims, and his encounter with death has brought him new dreams to consider.\nHis eyes are only half-focused as he passes currents of varying temperature and electrical fields and several times the smell of blood.

Her sister, Phenrum, is as luscious as a grape, but Buromi is ascetic, penitent, friendless. While Phenrum incites officers to duels in riverside establishments, Buromi sits alone in her tower, reading of saints and fakirs.\nYet it is Phenrum who will grow to be a wise ruler, who will keep her head when the Skalish invade the north, who will sponsor the arts and institute land reform. Phenrum pays careful attention to who thinks what about whom; she inspires loyalty more often than resentment, deals firmly with her enemies, and will be smart enough to let her best generals run the campaigns, to let lovely young scholars infatuated with Justice draft the principles of the land reform bill \u2014 but midwife, herself, a final version with the great landowners and the peasant party representatives.\nThe people will love Phenrum, speaking chidingly but with secret pride of her wild youth, for Phenrum is like them: a pragmatist, with no stomach for nonsense, who loves a friendly and orderly city and can throw a good party.\nAnd it is pious, dutiful Buromi who will run away; who will ride at the side of the barbarian chieftain Chukrafideritochs; whose soft hands will wield merciless knives; whose quiet throat will erupt with the shrieking battle cry; whose virginal womb will bear the young of Chukrafideritochs, sworn enemy of the white city.\nFor Buromi will conclude \u2014 from her prayer and study, from hearing Phenrum laughing and trysting in the gardens below her tower, from wandering in the market in disguise, seeing the slave auctions, seeing the begging street children \u2014 that the city is a denial of death and thus is the antithesis of freedom. Buromi will conclude that the only good in human life is freedom, and the expression of passion. She will long for a people that divides its food equally among all, where any can win honor with courage alone; and she will conclude that surplus is the enemy of such honesty and good will, and that the city is nothing but a machine for the hoarding of surplus.\nSo in the harvest time, when the barbarians ride into the grainlands, when they burn the villages and take the farmers\u2019 children and kill the farmers who resist, Buromi will be among them, pregnant, her hair unbound, riding bareback on a black charger, her long knife bloody and unsheathed. And the people of the city and its villages will hate Buromi, whom they used to revere when she was praying in her tower, who betrayed them and their idea of the world.\nPhenrum will send her dragoons to kill Buromi\u2019s husband and bring Buromi back in chains. But when they come back without her, having lost again the trail of the crafty Chukrafideritochs, sometimes Phenrum, for all her pragmatism and poise, will not be able to help herself. Sometimes Phenrum, queen of the white city, will quite inappropriately laugh with glee.\nBenjamin\u2018s work has appeared in the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, Strange Horizons and Writer Online.

Eric staggers in the headlight\u2019s shine, his knees buckling but his fists still raised. \u201cI ain\u2019t licked yet!\u201d he yells. I help him back into the car, and we speed off. I honk the horn, a final, cursing goodbye to all this drama and small-mindedness, goodbye to my stepfather\u2019s precious hunting dogs, their howls and pen-rattling frenzy receding by the time we fishtail onto the road. The speedometer\u2019s swift climb testifies to my deliverance from this hell.\nSilvery clouds shroud the moon, and with the cool, heavy scent of the green fields rushing over us, I know I\u2019ve never been more alive. I hold a T-shirt to Eric\u2019s bloodied face, and the fact that the asswipe has busted my boyfriend\u2019s nose matters less than knowing that Eric won\u2019t stand for anyone, not even a half-drunk bear who outweighs him by a good hundred pounds, cursing me or making me cry or peeking in at me through the bathroom keyhole. When I show him my stepfather\u2019s wallet, Eric tosses it out the window, saying he wouldn\u2019t take a million dollars from the jerk-off. This is my kind of love, a two-fisted and bloody adoration, the kind of love people write songs about. The kind of love people die for.\nWith a twist of his chin, Eric works his face away from the sopping T-shirt. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me he could punch like a mother fucker, darling,\u201d he says in an airy, pinched voice.\nI put my lips on his and kiss him. The gearshift stabs my ribs. Our wheels veer onto the shoulder, the gravel pinging beneath us in a hundred chunky notes. Blood coats our tongues with its coppery taste. \u201cDamn, girl, you are something else,\u201d Eric says when I pull away. I settle back into my seat and place a hand over the thumb-sized baby floating inside my belly. The night road hums beneath our speeding tires, our car a God-sent chariot taking us anywhere, anywhere but here.","source":"https:\/\/vestalreview.net\/so-this-is-love\/","source-hostname":"Vestal Review","excerpt":"by Curtis Smith Eric swoops down our unpaved lane, a scene of fury and kicked-up dust not witnessed this side of gladiatorContinue readingSo This is Love","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/j0hpExnuy5qUT6iJIFd1SmdymXo.json"}

After the nurses had cleaned him, they brought him to her, wrapped in a blanket, and placed him in her arms, just as if he were a real baby. Then they shut the door and left her alone. She stared down at the tiny monkey face, the veined eyes shut as if sleeping, and wanted to weep, but couldn\u2019t.\nNot long after the funeral, she and her husband split up and she moved to an apartment near the park. Most afternoons she walked there. One day she thought she saw a dead cat lying in the shallow end of a pond. Walking closer, she saw that she was mistaken. It was not a cat at all. It was a brown shoe, a man\u2019s, waterlogged.\nIt kept happening. She\u2019d see a dead mouse or a dying gull, wings flapping, and a sick feeling would rise in her throat. She\u2019d fight back the nausea, walk closer, only to see a piece of wood, a plastic bag fluttering\u2014and slowly the terror would subside.\nShe stopped walking in the park. Things returned to normal. Then one day, while on an errand, she saw a dog, its lifeless body slumped next to a parked car. Droplets of sweat beaded her forehead. Someone stopped to ask if she was all right. She could only point to the dead animal. The man shrugged and walked on, kicking it with his shoe, except suddenly she saw it for what it was: a bundle of tied-up newspapers.\nShe stayed inside. Because she worked at home\u2014she taught piano and her students came to her\u2014there was no need to go out. Sometimes she asked them to bring her things\u2014milk, soap, a box of tampons\u2014and she deducted the purchases from the lessons they owed. She was content, until late one night she tripped over a dead pigeon outside the bathroom. She ran back to bed and sat up all night, arms around knees, trembling. Morning showed the pigeon to be a gray sock from the hamper.\nOver the next few days, the animals took over. She canceled her lessons and confined herself to the bedroom, bringing food from the cupboards\u2014cereal and crackers and cans of pate\u2014and storing them under her bed. Once or twice a day, she\u2019d dash out to use the bathroom.\nThe animals crept into the hallway. She stopped sleeping altogether. Her food supply was getting low, but she didn\u2019t dare leave the bedroom. Soon there was nothing left to eat.\nOn the first of the month, a neighbor coming home late noticed the woman\u2019s lights still on and knocked. When no one answered, she peeked inside.\n\u201cI was so startled,\u201d she told the police after the ambulance had left. \u201cAt first all I saw was a heap of clothing on the floor.

He blinks twice before answering, which I consider to be significant. Either he has never entertained the possibility, or does not want to. He is young. I suddenly wish we had asked for someone older.\nNo, he finally replies. It doesn\u2019t work that way.\nBullshit, I think. If women can choose to forget the pain of childbirth in order to guarantee the continued populating of our planet, then surely we can choose to forget other memories, before they convene and decide amongst themselves which will go into hiding, which will grow blurred at the edges, and which will stay within reach. So I make a list.\nNote to Self:\nTo Forget: Having the person whose lunch you are eating walk into the office kitchen as you stuff the last bite of their sandwich\u2014pickle and peanut butter\u2014into your mouth. She does not believe that you have a \u201cglandular problem\u201d; it is written all over her face that you are the worst sort of miscreant. There is no recovering from this, and saying \u201cI thought it was mine\u201d only makes the situation worse.\nTo Remember: The first time he kissed you. Not so much the kiss itself, which was very fine, like falling into something deep that you couldn\u2019t see the bottom of, but the smell of the air that day: pi\u00f1on burning somewhere in the distance, the must of dried leaves, the lingering smoke of a campfire clinging to his wool shirt. You fell in love by sense of smell.\nTo Forget: The look on your son\u2019s face when you accused him of taking fifty dollars out of your purse. You were so certain; nothing he said could sway you. You watched his face crack open and your world shifted, but you convinced yourself that in this one case, principle was more important than love. You were wrong.\nTo Forget: Your best friend\u2019s husband, after a year of too many disappointments and an evening of too many glasses of wine, pulling you close in the hall closet when you handed him his coat. How you kissed him back for a split second before pushing him away so self-righteously. How you thought about that moment for far too long afterward.\nTo Forget: The first time you couldn\u2019t remember where you were: surrounded by cars, any of them could have been yours; the noise in the parking garage amplified and muffled at the same time. Like being dropped on a foreign planet, in a new skin, you cannot recognize yourself. How can you travel so far away from your life so fast?\nTo Remember: How frightened your husband looks now, hearing what will likely become of you. And still he holds your hand, running his fingers back and forth across every inch of your skin, like trying to memorize a page written in Braille.\nTo Remember: That someone loved you this much.","source":"https:\/\/vestalreview.net\/note-to-self\/","source-hostname":"Vestal Review","excerpt":"By Tracy Guzeman I ask the doctor if it is possible to choose what I am going to forget.

There, beneath an ochre moon, amid hills of slumbering geraniums and clumps of poisonous oleander leaves, Myra turned on the hose. As if blessing herself, she sprinkled water in a trickle until her hair hung like seaweed, her nightgown heavy as fog. She lay down on the cement and waited for her body to catch cold.\nDeep yellow daylight streamed through the shutters in Myra\u2019s room when she woke, and she could tell it was afternoon. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d her mom asked.\nWhen Myra said nothing, her mom tried again, \u201cHoney, you\u2019ve been asleep for almost two days.\u201d\nNo answer.\n\u201cWe found your wet nightie in the washer.\u201d\nNo answer.\n\u201cHoney, what happened?\u201d\nSilent and stubborn, Myra crimped shut her eyes and imagined oleander leaves in her mouth, the poison bitter and cruel.\nHer mom sighed. \u201cAt least your fever is down.\u201d\nMyra rolled over. She had learned that catching a cold was not like catching lizards or butterflies, things to be studied and released. A cold would not go away at will. Because she felt so ill, nothing much mattered to her. Was this nihilism, she wondered? It did not matter that she missed the exam in government class, for which she was unprepared. There would be a make-up test. Nor did it matter that she missed an announcement by her ogress of a gym teacher that from now on, students would have to take full showers instead of spit baths, something Myra was loathe to do since she considered herself fat, and ugly. Any exposure terrified her. She would hide, or claim she was on her period, dissemble illness, lie, and otherwise avoid showing her body, soft and white as sandwich bread.\nAt the moment, Myra focused on the lazy flow of motes that swirled in the band of light above her head.

Olivas\nMar\u00eda kept her eyes trained on the silver cigarette case that Dr. Templeton clutched in his right hand. She studied the Byzantine design on the case\u2019s surface. At first, Mar\u00eda believed that she saw the outline of a horrific, satanic face but, after a few moments of concentration, she discerned the contours of a rose, an overblown and sensuous example of the flower. In one fluid movement, Dr. Templeton popped the case open, withdrew a cigarette, snapped it shut, tapped the cigarette on the smooth back of the case, and slid it back into his jacket for a tweedy hibernation. The doctor then snatched a wooden match from a weighted leather cup on his desk and struck it on a rough patch on the side of the cup. The flame billowed red and blue and then subsided to a flicker before he drew it near the cigarette.\nTaking a deep drag, the doctor lowered his head and looked over his glasses at Mar\u00eda. He allowed the smoke to leak from the corners of his mouth and then, as if in irritation with the mechanics of smoking, he blew the remaining smoke from his nostrils with all the strength of his lungs so that he looked like an angry dragon. The plumes of smoke rose and then lingered about the doctor\u2019s unruly bush of red hair that seemed to spring from his head as if trying to escape.\n\u201cWhat else?\u201d asked Mar\u00eda in English.\nDr. Templeton looked sad, fatigued. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else, really. The cancer has gone on too long for us to do anything.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the time. How much did you say?\u201d\nThe doctor sighed. \u201cSix months to a year.\u201d He put his hand on Mar\u00eda\u2019s shoulder and he was surprised that she did not shake, but stood rock still. The nurse tried not to make much noise as she went about picking up and putting away medical files in the back of the office.\nMar\u00eda averted her eyes from Dr. Templeton\u2019s. She stared at a beautiful calendar that hung over the doctor\u2019s massive oak desk. At the top of the calendar was the year \u201c1943\u201d emblazoned in bright blue ink, with little Easter bunnies peeking from behind the numbers while colored eggs rolled about the foreground.

Imagine that feeling through your whole body. That\u2019s what it\u2019s like being wood again. You don\u2019t know how much you\u2019ll miss a thing like blood, or fingernails, until it\u2019s gone. You might never think about your regenerating skin cells, or the slosh of fluids in your stomach, or hiccups\u2014but imagine the constant chaos of your body suddenly going stiff. Being a real boy means being a good boy, she whispered beneath my thoughts. For years, I spent each day behind a desk, while the drone of flies mixed with the teacher\u2019s wandering voice, sunshine condensing into stuffy heat. And every evening I helped Gepetto hack up chunks of oak, despite the psychological implications. Chores and chastity and this aching boredom: the cost of borrowed flesh and bone.\nBut it\u2019s hard to stay good when the air is caught between seasons, tasting half of watermelon and half of pumpkin, and she\u2019s looking at you with those well-deep eyes. Did the fairy think I\u2019d stay a boy forever? Did her moon-blue skin just flush hot as a kettle when she peered down and saw me unbuttoning Carolena\u2019s skirt?\nI\u2019ve relearned how to use my Jenga-block fingers and clacking jaw, but not everything has a puppet approximation. Carolena tugs at her hair-bow like she\u2019s tolling a bell, and glances at my etched hair, my outdated, painted-on lederhosen. The breeze swirls up a kaleidoscope of leaves, and she plucks them from her hair, though they look like they belong there, nestled in her like-colored curls.\n\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d\n\u201cNot exactly.\u201d I don\u2019t bother explaining how it doesn\u2019t hurt, which is worse. Her blouse is pressed so well the shoulders are still relaxing out of the little peaks left by the iron. She\u2019s going to college someday, you can just tell. The sun is catching in my horse-hair eyelashes, rainbowing my vision, when she clasps my hand suddenly.\n\u201cMomma told me this could happen. She said making love too soon stunts your growth.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is what she meant, exactly.\u201d\n\u201cWell, what difference does it make, what she meant exactly?\u201d\nI can see perfectly the kind of woman Carolena will become, how she\u2019ll carry herself in lecture halls, the meals she\u2019ll someday prepare for her family. I can see her rushing miles ahead, and know somehow that it would have happened just the same, either way.\n\u201cDo you still love me?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cForever,\u201d I say, but my wooden heart doesn\u2019t even beat.\nMaia Harrison\u2019s work has previously been featured in the Orlando Sentinel and Touchstone Literary Journal, where she served as Editor-in-Chief from 2009 to 2011.

Dazed, she circles the garbage, rescuing random items \u2014 a doll, a book, a necklace, a feather \u2014 and clutches them to her, as if to staunch a wound.\nA dismal drizzle leaks from the darkening sky. Her eyes seek out the apartment window on the second floor. Her upturned face is wet. With rain or tears? You aren\u2019t sure. She raises her arms to you. In accusation? Supplication? You shrug, draw the curtains and pour a celebratory Scotch.\nNaturally, she\u2019s upset, but you know she understands.

Earlier, each of us had a separate session of our own. Now, the therapist sits in our circle, trying for eye contact to reassure us that she is with us for the long haul.\nTo be here, my husband needed to inform his secretary to hold this time open, to arrange a continuance on the Haythorpe case, to leave work without a bulging briefcase that keeps him in our downstairs study past my bedtime, preparing briefs and citing precedent past midnight most nights, lights blazing.\nTo be here, our daughter had to deign to emerge from her bedroom whose canopied bed is hung with mosquito netting she refuses to discuss, emerge from behind dark glasses, from under headphones, arms crossed over a Marilyn Manson t-shirt, one of thirty on the floor.\nTo be here, our son was subjected to another fatherly, lawyerly outburst no longer effective, although my husband hasn\u2019t figured this out yet, so I threatened cancellation of the DSL line, and the withdrawal of help with college applications scattered around his bedroom where he sleeps beside his monitor, all lights on.\nTo be here, I needed to make the appointments, write my husband a reminder, watch my daughter write the time and place on the palm of her hand, and stick a post-it on my son\u2019s computer. I needed to leave my rosewood desk where I write my weekly column on new restaurants, to forego meditation, to leave my book on the guest room bed, where I frequently sleep or daydream of the ghost who wanders through the house, long skirts swishing against hard-edged Danish furniture, lantern held yearningly high in her search for something or someone. I needed to entice the family to assemble, cajole us to arrive today at the same time to hear just where we go from here.\nBut first, the therapist says, she has one other thing to say. Then she laughs, a tinkly laugh she surely would have stifled had she realized how dismissive she sounds about the only thing she could have said to send us out of her office forever, not cured\u2014cured of what, anyway?\u2014but a family again.\nGiggling, my daughter rises to announce, \u201cThat settles that.\u201d Her brother follows her out the door asking, \u201cWas it pearly white?\u201d and then their father stands and looks around as if precedent has somehow failed him, but he\u2019ll give it another chance. He follows the kids, calling, \u201cLet\u2019s all go to lunch.\u201d The therapist is clearly feeling left out, but what can I do but eventually pay her bill?

When she first walks on the moon, a breeze is blowing and leaves are rustling all around her. Her father brushes them off the stage, then hands her a small American flag on a stick. It flaps quietly as she walks the perimeter, gradually picking up speed. Once the stage starts revolving, it\u2019s as if she\u2019s walking in a straight line, taking an afternoon stroll across the surface of the moon. Behind the stage, her father has installed a big screen, onto which he projects footage from NASA\u2019s most recent lunar mission. In silence, these images play across her face, making it appear like she\u2019s walking not on but through the moon, then disappearing into another dimension entirely. Soon the moon in the backyard becomes a portal, and she approaches it gladly, knowingly, well aware that passing through it means leaving her father behind, perhaps forever.

Momma leaves and I sit on the couch and read. Momma comes back and goes into her room. I hear the shoebox scrape across the floor and the rattle of diamond on metal.

The air drafts toss them to the four corners of my one-room world.\nAt night, Momma talks. She talks about the way the streets smelled that day. She talks about the fountain in the park filling up with coins and bubbling over. She tells me how a man in the bodega thought he won the lottery. He checked his scratch off and totaled the numbers up and yelled. He\u2019d won. The excitement overwhelmed him. His chest tightened. The man clutched at his sternum, tried to pull the bone away from his spine to give his heart more space. He went down on one knee, about to offer up one of those beautiful rings, and then he rolled back, quiet. When the police came they looked at his scratch\u2013off for evidence. The man had misread it. He was one number off.\nWhen Momma left yesterday, I read, I chased the light, and I napped with my head on the couch\u2019s arm rest and my chin tucked in. I woke up and she still wasn\u2019t back. The rings started to shake. I could hear the cha-chaka-cha-chaka-cha, a metallic maraca\u2019s rhythm. I stood in the door frame and watched the box slide from under her bed. The box had never moved for me before. When I opened it, the glow from the diamonds shone across the apartment. I grabbed two fistfuls of rings and squeezed.","source":"https:\/\/vestalreview.net\/momma-like-a-magpie\/","source-hostname":"Vestal Review","excerpt":"By Adam Straus Like a magpie, Momma is drawn to shiny things.

Does she write the forbidden words\u2014love, love, love? Does she write words even she won\u2019t send, words that make her mad and hopeless and bereft? Letters crumpled, one after another, as she writes to bring you to her, to make you speak her name before all others.\n***\nMom\u2019s writing another letter. She tells me that it\u2019s homework for her college class, but I don\u2019t think homework starts \u201cDear One\u201d or ends \u201cLove, love, love.\u201d I think it\u2019s gross, to be so out-there for \u201cDear One.\u201d I wonder if he\u2019s someone who\u2019s come to the house or if he\u2019s the one she calls, twisting her hair like my sister does when she gets all moony over her latest heartthrob.\nSometimes I pick up letters she thinks she\u2019s shoved far down enough into the garbage to be invisible.

It\u2019s disguised with scent, as if it\u2019s personal, but it\u2019s not from another one of his floozies. I know that. He\u2019d never date anyone who wouldn\u2019t take the time to buy stationary. This one\u2019s written in code, on a piece of torn-out notebook paper. The words are filled with portents. Like the last one, \u201cDear One, please come back.\u201d It\u2019s clearly an encrypted message. He\u2019s in the spy business, my Dear One. He works in The Blue Cube. Everyone says it\u2019s just an army base but I know otherwise. Harry says he\u2019s a supplier\u2014he ships goods overseas. But I know what that means. There are lots of different kinds of goods. And all words have hidden meaning, don\u2019t they? \u201cI need you\u201d just means there\u2019s a job that takes him away again. And \u201clove, love, love\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s the universal code for \u201csurrender.\u201d Ask any woman. Harry reads the letter quickly, then folds it away as if it burns him.

She had a desperate compulsion to stargaze-an unromantic, obsessive impulse to memorize the constellations as they swept across the blackness of the expansive prairie sky. At her lowest, she took salted baths. But by her early twenties, she was nearly oblivious to the constant motion. She rebounded from dishwasher to dinner table, accustomed to the whirl and tilt.

I press myself beneath a canopying rock, listen to the patter, try to fall asleep.\nMy grandfather was in the army. He told me that they told him that when you can\u2019t sleep, you should raise one arm straight up into the air, that you\u2019ll get tired eventually. I try it, but it doesn\u2019t work. I wonder sometimes how much they tell you in the army is just to make a fool of you. I wonder the same thing about school.\nI set a trap for Santa, but then got scared and took it down. It was just a camera that I pointed at the tree and rigged with a timer to take a picture every five minutes. But Santa doesn\u2019t come if you pay attention, and I thought that might include hidden cameras.

She calls me her Little Man, and says that she doesn\u2019t have room in her life for any other men.

I wonder if this is cheating, so I try to stop listening, to fall asleep.

A wind blows and the rain turns cold. In between the raindrops is a stray snowflake, here and there. The rock is cool where I lean against it, comforting.

A low caliber, but their quarry was fragile. It drifted roughly where her brother had said, high above the ground. Its two wings beat in slow, lazy flaps, each feather golden.\nHer father\u2019s voice was hot against her ear. \u201cLook for where it\u2019s gonna be. Not where it is.\u201d Hannah took aim, held her breath.\n***\nIn the car, Dave told her about the first time he went hunting. \u201cIt was a big bull, eight wings and just covered in eyes, all fire and geometric sound. He saw me aiming at his choir\u2014it was just him and a couple of two-wingers\u2014and charged at me. The noise was like nothing else. But I stayed calm and raised my gun and shot him right in the neck. He was still singing as dad and I drove up but didn\u2019t sound so pretty anymore.\u201d\nHannah stared at him with wide eyes. \u201cJust one shot?\u201d\n\u201cJust one.\u201d Dave had cried when they\u2019d found it dying, but he didn\u2019t need to tell his sister that.\nTheir father watched the exchange in their truck\u2019s rearview mirror, his eyes crinkling. \u201cThey go down easy. That was the deal we all made with God. We got metal, they got to speak His language.\u201d\n***\nHannah pulled the trigger and felt the powder ignite, the bullet rattling its way up the barrel. It left the rifle in a flash of fire, long before the concussive sound had reached her ears, and spiraled through the air in a perfect spinning arch, climbing high above the ground before Hannah had even realized the gun had fired.\nAs the bullet approached its target, the contrast between the two grew starker. The bullet was heavy and dark, notched and pitted from the speed of its journey, light enough to travel through the air but heavy with earth and the finality of its destination. It was singular, brutal; there were no hidden depths to a bullet.\nIts target was everything that the bullet was not. Shining gold, so light it seemed to fade and flicker with the air, each wing a tern\u2019s arc making paddle wheels in the air. Its body was perfection, radiant in its seamlessness, each limb screaming the flawlessness of its whole. On the surface it was organic, but beneath that paper lantern skin stretched inner architecture, columns and escherine stairs that formed veins. It was math given form, inexplicable and wonderful.\nHannah\u2019s shot was just a little off. She clipped one wing, scattering golden clothoid feathers in a red spray of blood. The angel went down in a slow, weak spiral, its other wing fluttering pathetically. It didn\u2019t scream or flail. It didn\u2019t even break its song. She felt a burst of sorrow\u2014they were so pretty\u2014but by then the dogs were after it.\nCooper Gelb is an emerging writer from Chicago, where he lives with his cat, Linus, and works full time as a content editor.

Harry answered that he didn\u2019t know for sure, hadn\u2019t ever thought about it, and didn\u2019t care. When Professor Ratermann asked about Flaubert\u2019s La Tentation de Saint Antoine, he replied that he was not a Christian and was not troubled by Temptation and that, besides, he thought that the illustrations and the tribulations were grotesque.\nProfessor Neuenagel threw up his hands in despair and queried Harry about Mariology, the ideal of Courtly Love in the Arthurian Cycle, and the quests of Perceval on his white horse with long lances and banners. Harry answered that this had nothing to do with him, and that he wasn\u2019t much interested in Sir Perceval\u2019s girlfriend. All were in despair around a long oak table.\nIn the early afternoon, Harry drove through slush and snow to the supermarket, where he was able to find six sturdy packing boxes. Harry then drove to his rented room in a stranger\u2019s house. He carried the boxes up to his room, in which there was a bed, a chair, a desk, and shelves of books and essays he had written about those books. He placed the books and essays randomly on the floor, and then sorted them into five separate piles, according to century. Harry would put the essays he had written about those books into a separate pile, and into a sixth box.\nIt was now about four in the afternoon, and the sunlight was beginning to fade. In two hours it would be dark at Lake McBride, and Harry didn\u2019t want to drive back to Iowa City in the snow and perhaps over black ice.\nThe lake was frozen solid. Visitors had been there, but now were gone. Their tracks leading to and from the lake were undisturbed in the foot-deep snow. Harry was alone in the park.\nBy the time he had finished carrying each box of books and the box of essays about those books down to the frozen edge to abandon them there, the only light remaining was the last of an orange tinge on the snow and lake ice, and on the lids of the boxes of books, and on the lid of the box of essays. Harry would be driving back in the dark.\nTo have come with so many books and essays, and then to leave with nothing at all, seemed a pity. He put his hand into the box of books with titles concerning French Literature of the Nineteenth Century. Even in the near darkness, he saw the blood-red letters set against the light beige cover of the book that would not remain in the deep snow by the lake edge.

I want to ask her, but I don\u2019t. It is a miracle everything in the world isn\u2019t leaking. Why don\u2019t they make condoms out of what they make the water pipes out of, if they don\u2019t want leakage? Ha! A big lead condom, that really would stop Billy wanting to lie down.\nSo I told Billy we cannot trust the condoms and he made a big show of being all disappointed, but I don\u2019t think he was, not really. He always says they suffocate him just when he needs to breathe the most. He talks some shit sometimes, he does. So I told him there would be no lying together until we\u2019d got some way of making sure against babies. I told him there\u2019d be no more standing up behind Ma Palatour\u2019s lean-to either, and that got him thinking pretty good.\nSo the next day Billy comes to me and he says he\u2019s got it!

I know it was that time because the toothpaste stung like crazy and we didn\u2019t lie down again for weeks.

How he got in was anyone\u2019s guess, but the foundation was hardly impregnable, the floorboards prone to cracks, inadequate border walls for small, flexible spines. Though the initial glance was fleeting, a dark blur glimpsed behind the bookcase, that night she came down with a flashlight and lay on the floor in her nightgown, searching, the ray of light cutting through the dust balls until he stood revealed, a small field rat cowering beside the sofa leg, whiskers quivering.\nAn exterminator was out of the question. Their household was vegetarian, their toothpaste and shampoo cruelty-free, and so the quest began for a humane trap. The only one available, designed for squirrels and skunks, proved ineffective, the rat\u2019s weight too slight to trigger the release.\nOn the second day she named him Randy and started visiting each night, preferring the couch to the tired springs of the marital bed. While the rest of the house slept, she soothed him by singing old Tori Amos songs and serving dime-sized slices of organic cheese on a paper plate, a teaspoon of rice milk and three Craisins offered as dessert.\nShe cherished the routine. Trading the flashlight for the warmer glow of a candle, she watched him scurrying around his sanctuary, his furtive movements calmed by the sound of her voice. Within his eyes, she found poetry and grace, empathy for the creeping stigma of her aging body. Randy understood her, she was certain of it; he soon became her ally in face-offs with her teenage daughter, a sympathetic ear for her gnawing frustrations. He supported her tirades over societal injustices, complemented the blonde highlights meant to mask her frizzy grey. Her husband, normally patient but rat-phobic and irritated, retreated to the basement, the living room now off-limits to all but her and Randy.\nWhen the ultimatum came, she feigned indifference (Let those fascists on the Board of Health just try, she thought), but cognizant of society\u2019s abundant cruelty, she sensed their time was short. Her astrologer urged surrender, but when the witch doctor offered an alternative, she waited not a breath. She swallowed the powders, ingested the eye of newt, and shrunk herself Twinkie-sized, scurrying under the couch to take refuge in his lair.\nAt first, she was cold, her unclothed body not meant for window drafts and hardwood floors in winter, but as she cuddled against him in his nest, the old rumpled tissues proved adequate bedding, his fur a natural quilt.\nThe black droppings on the floor suggest the couple is doing well.\nChuck Augello lives and writes in New Jersey.

He escapes from his messy, loud days, but not because of any wonderful thing he didn\u2019t expect to happen\u2014but by the opposite. Tragedy and dread have brought him here, though he hasn\u2019t gone anywhere since the accident occurred. It hasn\u2019t happened all that long ago.

He tries to will the damage upon himself, but all he can do is watch as the forces of nature tear his family apart. He\u2019s horrified by the cruelty of the equations he\u2019d written on chalkboards. All thoughts of bodily needs and monetary expenditures and his longing for peace and quiet are gone. He wants to go back to the time of squalling children and short-tempered wife. He wants to revel in the sounds of anger and concern, and if that isn\u2019t possible, he wants the accident to continue for all eternity so that at least they can be together. The car is still shredding itself against the stony precipice and his loves are gone now, he can feel it, and he\u2019s never heard such quiet in all his life.\nThe tumbling continues and he knows he\u2019s alone and that the violence won\u2019t come for him unbidden, and so between impacts he opens the car door and unbuckles his seatbelt and the jaws of nature clamp down on him and pull him out into the maelstrom. He tastes rock and dust and the steely gush of blood, and then suddenly he\u2019s back in the car, driving the winding mountain road, the sky going yellow and silhouetting the pines and the guardrails and the rocky ridgelines, so that everything seems to be tall and two-dimensional and lovely. He wipes the tears from his cheeks and sits up straight and drives carefully. His young daughters are fighting over the last bag of potato chips and his wife is shouting at them to behave themselves, to please, please, please at least try to pretend they are civilized human beings, and there are tears and wails and accusations and all the usual racket of life, and he\u2019s the happiest man who ever lived, to hear it.\nTerry DeHart lives in California with his wife and two daughters.

She had been in a park where the leaves on the sycamore trees were bursting in color, reds and oranges like candied apples and pumpkins. The mother had been in the park with her daughter, who was wearing neon shoelaces, which disappeared from sight as the mother chatted with a friend on a bench under the sycamore trees. The sky was clear blue and a family of birds swept by, on their way to warmer lands. A man in a long yellow coat spoke nonsensically through a megaphone; perhaps he was homeless. A swarm of kids in pink, gold, blue and green scrambled to the swings.\nThe girl had been crawling in a tunnel, which the mother felt must have turned into a spaceship. Every night the mother lay in bed imagining her daughter crawling through the tunnel. Once she submerged inside, all the noises from the park\u2014yelping, laughter, whistles, chatter, wind shaking the trees\u2014must have come to a halt. Was her daughter afraid? Did she scream out for help? Was the tunnel hollow, or thick with a steel-like ring to it? Had all been dark around her? Did she scream for her mother? She must have wished there was light to guide her forward. Her every step, every crinkle in her coat, must have rung out in the vast silence. Her daughter must have wondered how long the tunnel was. Every night the mother wondered how long the tunnel was.\nThe mother put up child missing signs and wept in her husband\u2019s arms. She looked at pictures for endless hours, which seemed to mark a past that had hauntingly halted with no forewarning. The child kept crawling through the tunnel until she reached a door. To her astonishment, it led to a hallway. A lady with deep forehead crinkles and too much powder on her cheeks sat at a table at the end of the hallway sipping tea. Her hair was tied back in dark coils and her lips left red lipstick smudges on her mug. Perhaps she acted like a mother to the girl. Perhaps she fed her and gave her a warm bed to sleep in. Some days the girl looked out the window at the stars. Perhaps from this high up in space it was always dark and the stars never told if it was night or day. Perhaps at the same moment the girl looked at the stars, the mother popped up in the dark, waking up from a nightmare of a woman with dark red lips pushing her daughter out of the spaceship into the open sky of stars, and her daughter, arms flailing, falling against the bright, clear orbs of light. Some nights the mother would wake up in a sweat with an image of the man in the park with the long yellow coat and the megaphone. Where was her daughter now?

Small island, small people, small apartments, small bathrooms. Her bathroom is four feet square, to be precise. She sits in the tepid bathtub, knees to chin. The tub is deeper than it is wide; it\u2019s like bathing in a drinking glass.\n\u201cTonight I will be at Brendan\u2019s,\u201d she thinks, closing her eyes. \u201cHe will get me ice cream.\u201d The thought is almost unbearably pleasant.\nShe meets Brendan at a stand bar that\u2019s the size of a Greyhound bus-station bathroom. She sits hunched over a plate-sized table to keep from knocking her head on a low-hanging Styrofoam lobster. Brendan is Welsh. He has a large head and a beaky nose, and he talks about football. She knows nothing about football. She lets him talk for the requisite hour, nodding. Then she touches his thigh with her knee and says the same thing she always does:\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to your place.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a beautiful warm night, low and purple. She leads the way, like a dog pulling at a leash. He chuckles at her back.\n\u201cYou\u2019re always so eager,\u201d he says, and pride at his assumed prowess brightens his tone. He doesn\u2019t understand. He wouldn\u2019t be flattered if he did.\nBrendan\u2019s apartment is on the top floor of a pre-war building built of red cedar and white pine. She squeezes past him, running up the narrow stairs, waiting for him on the landing, wiggling with anticipation. He unlocks the door and she kicks off her shoes. She hurries down the wood-panelled hall and slides the shoji screen to one side.\nSix tatamis glow up at her. Twelve feet by nine feet of gleaming space, devoid of furniture, empty. The beauty of it makes her stomach twist.\nShe stretches herself out on the gleaming floor, extending her feet and hands as far as they can go. She closes her eyes and smooths the backs of her arms against the slippery woven grass.\nBrendan stands in the doorway, looking down at her. He half-smiles as he unbuttons his shirt. The profundity of impending loss electrifies her.\n\u201cIce cream,\u201d she says.\nHe frowns.\n\u201cAgain?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a warm night, wouldn\u2019t it be nice?\u201d\nHe rolls his eyes, but he buttons his shirt back up.\nShe hears the clutter of keys and the shuffle of heavy feet down wooden steps. She closes her eyes. She breathes, in and out. It is a delicious effort, moving air through the great space around her.\nIn ten minutes he\u2019s back. A pint of green tea ice cream bulges in a white plastic bag.\n\u201cHard as a rock,\u201d he said huskily, pleadingly. \u201cNeeds time to sit.\u201d\nShe sighs. Fair is fair. She opens her arms to him.

He\u2019s driving without maps and only moving in a general direction because he has no idea where it will happen, next. The plain is gray as the wings of a spider-wrapped moth. Rusted barbed wire along the road, the fences filled with trash. Paper cups and plastic straws and slimy burger wrappers and cigarette butts and beer cans, the color faded completely out of them because the old days are gone.\nThe land is without contour as far as he can see, and the sky blends without definition into the earth. The road is straight and cold and patched with tar that the tires thump against and whine against and fight against.\nIt seems a culmination of days. The one, long day that will never end. The man is tired but he continues to drive. There are no other cars. No pedestrians, no hitchhikers, no range animals, no wildlife, no homes. Only the road and the barbed wire and him.\nAnd then there\u2019s a flash of color on the horizon. The man stops the car and gets out and hears the prairie wind in his ears. The light is now a fireball rising in the distance. Lovely reds and oranges and purples expand to color the world. He can hear the breeze blowing through the dead grass. The column of color rises and spreads. The man is very far away and it takes a long time for the shockwave to reach him. He has time to light a cigarette and lean against the car. He watches the mushroom grow and he waits for it.\nWhen it comes, it doesn\u2019t hit all at once. It\u2019s like a rogue wave on the seashore. The air grows still and then it swirls and eddies, though there are no terrain features to channel it. A warm puff on the face at first. The breath of a lover moving closer. He blushes. And then there\u2019s a gentle slap. His hair stands up and then lies flat again, as if somebody opened and closed a gigantic door. He gets an adrenaline thrill, but he doesn\u2019t take cover. The roar comes like an approaching train or a column of tanks or a stampede of wild horses. The rumble is long and loud and the overpressure rocks the car on its springs and the man puts out his smoke and the wave pushes him back a step. And then it comes with full force, wild and hot, and the man leans into it at an impossibly steep angle. He screams as the colors penetrate his body with their hot packets of energy.\nWhen it stops, the man pitches forward onto the road. He rolls onto his back and breathes in and out.

Except my mother would never have been in a public library fifteen years ago and certainly not today. She is not much of a reader, and when she does read, she\u2019ll buy the hottest new bestseller in hardcover and let it sit on her nightstand for weeks, a little pedestal for her Klonopin and glass of water. She is more likely to be thumbing through Architectural Digest or watching reruns of TV shows from the early 90s. She can\u2019t fall asleep without the television on. The low drone of the laugh track a soothing kind of ambient noise machine; the glow of the screen, and the Klonopin, gently lulling her into slumber.\nThis woman in the library was like my mother, had my mother grown up outside of a major city in a home with a yard and a maybe an older brother. This woman was a reader and a free spirit. She looked like the kind of woman who had a big dog at home, a faithful dog that gave her sloppy kisses and wagged its tail in the front hall. Oh, yes, certainly, she had a front hall and maybe even one of those organization stations that they sell at Pottery Barn, with the coat hooks and the mail tray and the little box for your keys.\nThis woman was my mother, had my mother played high school volleyball or become a teacher or married her college sweetheart, never had a divorce, never took diet pills, or did juice fasts, or chain-smoked at a health spa. No, for this woman, health was not about weight but a truly balanced life full of whole grains and soy milk and dark leafy greens. This was a woman who could be affectionate, a true communicator, someone who would write you letters that expressed genuine sentiments rather than serially reporting the events in her social calendar in a stream-of-consciousness rant. And when she listened to you practice the violin, she would probably look up from paying the bills or chopping an onion to tell you how beautifully you play.\nI watched her weave her way in and out of the non-fiction stacks. She had nice posture and good walking shoes. She seemed clear-eyed and focused, not flighty, not the type of woman who changed the subject before the subject was ready to be changed. She was the sort who most certainly made eye contact and her face bespoke a kind of emotional intelligence.\nI ran into her on my way into the ladies\u2019 room. I tried to catch her eye, to see if perhaps she recognized something in me, some unnamable psychic connection, but she was blotting her eyes and readjusting her glasses, and I noticed that tucked underneath her arm was the library\u2019s copy of Healing Self-Hate: A Personal Journey.\nSari Edelstein teaches in the English Department at Skidmore College.

You are a couple only here, this place with pool cues in a barrel in the middle of the barroom and Bessie Smith on the jukebox.

But you only have to put your ear to the ground for a few moments to realize that the whispers are insistent and unanimous: Jackson is your man; his forgeries are flawless; his technique is unsurpassed; his equipment is the most modern that money can buy. The rumors say that Jackson has had his cameras and scanners smuggled in from America. This in itself, the whispers intimate, is proof enough of the greatness of his powers. But most of all, the whispers say: look around. Do you ever see or hear of anyone who has been stopped at the borders with a Jackson passport? A Jackson forgery is like magic. You will melt away like a ghost in the morning sunlight.\nSo we have gathered our meager savings and come to this lop-sided alleyway and knocked on the door just as the whispers have instructed. And a man with a face that is 80 per cent beard and 20 per cent spectacles has clapped us on the shoulder warmly and hustled us inside. We have sat in a back room, snug in the thick embrace of the smell of printing inks and nervous tension.\nWe have had our pictures taken with cameras that look complex and searching, and seem more related to X-ray machines. We have watched our faces be flipped and magnified on screens. We have watched Jackson\u2019s fingers ripple over keyboards, work minutely with paintbrushes, rub delicately at shiny foils and complex papers with watermarks deep within them. And, finally, we have held in our hands those precious blue books that are our tickets to freedom, our talismans which, we hope, will make us, too, melt away at the borders like so many before us. We are soon back out again in the alleyway, with our ears still tingling with Jackson\u2019s whispered instructions as to how to make the passports as old and weathered as we are ourselves.\nAnd so now we stand nervously in line, afraid even to breathe too deeply lest it disturb the fragile atmosphere that surrounds the checkpoint. We finger the corners of our passports nervously, a last opportunity for some last-minute weathering on the little blue books. Out here, in this line, we are beyond even the reassuring hum of the whispers that once spoke of Jackson\u2019s greatness.\nIt is then that we feel a clap on the shoulder, heavy and cold and somehow familiar, and it is then that we realize there is another explanation as to why nobody with a Jackson forgery is ever seen or heard of ever again.","source":"https:\/\/vestalreview.net\/the-greatness-of-the-forger\/","source-hostname":"Vestal Review","excerpt":"by Nick Parker Things being what they are these days, you can imagine that nobody exactly hangs out a shingle saying: forgeries here whileContinue readingThe Greatness of the Forger","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/blvMpt3uaLdjcKy2pwQZbUsJERs.json"}

For instance: the tall, gaunt waiter with graceful hands (does he spend his evenings at the piano, in a cramped apartment he shares with his mother). And the elegant woman two tables away, who has a little brown dog tucked into her jacket (is she wearing a silk blouse of the same fine quality as her tweed, or does she hold the beast against her bare skin, a secret pleasure she enjoys in public). There\u2019s a young man (of course there is) at the extreme of your periphery, who\u2019s reading the book of poetry you read last week, the one you loved, the one you felt was written just for you.

He might welcome a casual comment or even invite you to join him (this is the fantasy) because he is not looking for a beauty but a soul mate, someone with astute insights into rhythm and tone. You turn slightly in your seat (in case the young man should wish to engage you in conversation) and gaze across the boulevard. There is an apartment for rent on the opposite corner; a sign hangs from a balcony in front of shuttered windows. Below, a tall wooden door stands slightly ajar, offering the slim view of a courtyard garden. You imagine yourself a resident of this city, the inhabitant of a third-floor apartment with windows facing the park, a habitu\u00e9 of this caf\u00e9 (the waiter would greet you daily with a friendly jut of the chin, would have your usual order at the ready).\nIt is not until the bookish young man stands up, drawing your eyes away from the shuttered windows, and greets a long-haired fellow in a tomato-red scarf\u2014they do not speak, but kiss on the cheek once, twice, three times\u2014that you recollect the story (prosaic, inevitable) awaiting you in another city on the other side of the ocean. Getting to your feet, you hoist your leather bag onto a shoulder, and stride off, head down, toward the river. You forget the cotton sweater slung over the back of your seat, and though the waiter (whose mother is long dead) calls after you, holding the sweater aloft, you do not hear him (there\u2019s a musician drumming on upturned buckets at the street corner), nor do you see the young man (who is mute; he cannot shout, but he can run) pluck your sweater from the waiter\u2019s grasp and sprint after you, much to the amusement of the elegant woman (who is fully dressed, but not quite sober), so you don\u2019t turn around until he taps your shoulder, breathing hard, his face aglow and his eyes telling you what he cannot say.","source":"https:\/\/vestalreview.net\/this-is-the-beginning\/","source-hostname":"Vestal Review","excerpt":"By Lili Flanders You are in a foreign city, seated at a round metal table outside a caf\u00e9, pushing the flakes ofContinue readingThis is the Beginning","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/oHw12v1gOmKyvDP9GBEqFIQ4PUE.json"}

Weaver\nTwo people were sitting in a caf\u00e9. A man and a woman. It is tempting to say they were having coffee, but hardly any women drink coffee anymore. Even fewer are willing to meet you for it.\nIt\u2019s the invitation\u2014Would you like to have a cup of coffee with me?\u2014it implies something that getting a beer does not. Coffee drinkers are serious people; they want to talk about serious things and brood. The stakes are higher with them. Women know this. A man who asks you to coffee may be secretly in love with you. He may have hopes that a romance will bud. Beer drinkers are watering a different plant.\nYou go to bed with a beer drinker and the worst that could happen is you wake up with a hangover, naked and alone, for beer drinkers are apt to sneak away while you\u2019re still sleeping.\nCoffee drinkers get out of bed frequently during the night, but it is usually just to go pee or to fix themselves another cup of coffee.\nLook into a beer drinker\u2019s shifty eyes. He wants to make you laugh. He\u2019s trying to think of a good bar joke, while the dream-gazing coffee drinker seems to be always in the midst of concocting a love poem. He\u2019ll write you one, and read it to you at your wedding. And later he\u2019ll say it was fate that brought you together that day at Caf\u00e9 La Rochelle, because he\u2019s a coffee drinker and coffee drinkers generally believe in fate.\nAnd so there they were\u2014the man and the woman, a pair of porcelain cups between them, sharing a window booth at a nice little place on West Eighty-fifth Street. He had asked her to coffee, and she had said yes. Whatever their involvement had been prior to stepping inside, whatever terms had been set beforehand, the very fact of her presence was reassuring to the man: a sign that her feelings ran deeper than a pint glass.\nMight she be curious about the next level of the relationship? What if she dreamt about him? What if he was present in that motorcade of ghosts that passes just before sleep? And what if she wasn\u2019t so broken by the things behind her to not try again? Or was it presumptuous to think she had ever been broken? Had she ever even been chipped?\nThe man brooded while he sat there and sipped his coffee. Today he was not a beer drinker.\nHe looked up at the woman. She was looking at him, so he quickly averted his eyes to the window. He studied the architecture of a cargo van. It was double-parked in front of a bodega across the street, delivering cases of beer.\nAfter a while, he looked back down at the tabletop. Then he noticed them: coffee rings. Circular biographies of a boy with no saucer. Of course, there were none on her side of the table. She was having tea.","source":"https:\/\/vestalreview.net\/two-people\/","source-hostname":"Vestal Review","excerpt":"By D.C. Weaver Two people were sitting in a caf\u00e9. A man and a woman.

But he was in quarantine again, and felt that he was entering the final phase. So I buried Babylon in the flowerpot on the balcony in which I otherwise keep the sweetpeas. So the sweetpeas had to die. Have you noticed that death breeds faster than life?\nThat night, I dreamt that Babylon pushed open my bedroom door and was clawing at my stomach, growling Babymama, Babymama. Naturally, I informed him there was no way for him to get back in, but dead dream things so seldom listen to reason. In the morning, I planted the flowerpot with garlic, just to be on the safe side. I would not wish for him to turn into a vampire. I owe him that much.\nThen William came back, and was in a foul mood because he was sure next time it would be the end of him. But this mood passed, and one twilight in autumn, William woke up and said that the smell of Babylon was gone. I tried to convince him that I had only given Babylon to the landlords for safekeeping, just until the plague was over; they had a bunker and would throw food scraps in. But William only laughed\u2014he is an atheist; he does not think the plague will end\u2014and demanded that I tell him the truth. I insisted that the truth was even deader than god, but he dug up the flowerpot anyway.\nNow Babylon was all bones. I told William to be glad, for in this way, Babylon had fed many. We could plant anything on him, to feed on him: cedars, chrysanthemums, leeks. But William is full of taboos, and we had to go to a cemetery. I warned him, but he insisted.\nWilliam carried Babylon in a plastic bag, and I made a fine cross out of old gas canisters for the camping stoves.

The air was Sticky-hot and small beads of sweat glistened on her upper lip. A line of tourists strolled past, reeking of cologne and suntan lotion. San Antonio in June was packed with throngs of tourists, a boisterous and tedious bunch.\nA group of mariachis slowly moved along the narrow path. Their fat-bellied guitars thrummed through the thick air and the horns blared tinnily. Jamie used his fork to pick at his enchiladas, stirring the sour cream until it pooled and melted into the guacamole.\n\u201cWell, girl,\u201d he said, motioning for another drink. \u201cWhere next? Fancy a trip to Buenos Aires? Rio? Cancun?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d rather leave the Third World, thank you.\u201d Samantha\u2019s voice was as frosty as her glass. \u201cI don\u2019t want to catch some nasty sort of disease and die in one of these revolting countries.\u201d\n\u201cThis is America; it\u2019s hardly a Third World country.

I want to go home to Mother. You can die in one of these disgusting ratholes, for all I care. Just give me a share of the money.\u201d\nJaime said with icy calm, \u201cYou can\u2019t have any of the money. Do you think I want you going back through customs with a case of cash? You can keep everything that\u2019s in the bank at home and the flat as well.\u201d He had to raise his voice in order to be heard over the approaching musicians. He\u2019d taken everything out of their joint account already. Silly bitch.\n\u201cI hope you die,\u201d Samantha said. \u201cPreferably with shit running down your legs and Montezuma\u2019s revenge tearing your insides to bits.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m too lucky to die,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cAnd too rich. If the tax men can\u2019t find me, what makes you think Death will?\u201d\nThe mariachis strolled up to the table, the music deafening. Jamie waved them away, knocking the fresh drink onto his lap.\n\u201cDammit,\u201d he said. He rose from his chair, tottering.\nThe mariachi holding the largest guitar turned slightly, as if to avoid an oncoming tourist. The bulbous belly of the guitar struck Jamie across his side. Jamie cartwheeled his arms, struggling to catch his balance, but failed. With a slick splash, he sank into the tepid waters of the river.\nThe musicians played on. Jamie did not surface. Gradually, the mariachis strolled away. Samantha watched mutely. A silver concho shaped like a skull gleamed on the back of the guitarist\u2019s costume.

In fact, she would not have to do anything at all. Mrs.Winter said that Charles would not wake while she and Mr. Winter were out at the movies. He was a very sound sleeper, she said. No need to have a bottle for him or anything. Before the Winters left they said absolutely please not to look in on the sleeping baby because the door squeaked too loudly.\nHarriet had never held a baby, except for one brief moment, when she was about six, when Mrs. Antler next door had surprisingly bestowed on her the tight little bundle that was their new baby, Andrea. Harriet had sat very still and her arms had begun to ache from the tension by the time Mrs. Antler took back her baby. Andy was now a plump seven-year-old, older than Harriet had been when she held her that day.\nAfter two hours of reading all of the boring mail piled neatly on a desk in the bedroom and looking through a depressing wedding album filled with photographs of dressed-up people in desperate need of orthodonture (Harriet had just ended two years in braces and was very conscious of malocclusion issues) while flipping channels on their television, Harriet turned the knob on the baby\u2019s door very tentatively, but it seemed locked. She didn\u2019t dare turn the knob with more pressure because what if she made a noise and woke him and he started to cry?\nShe stood outside the door and tried to hear the sound of a baby breathing but she couldn\u2019t hear anything through the door but the sound of the occasional car that passed by on the street outside. She wondered what Charles looked like. She wasn\u2019t even sure how old he was. Why had she agreed to baby-sit when Mr. Winter approached her at the swim club? She had never seen him before, and it was flattering that he took her for being capable, as if just being a girl her age automatically qualified her as a baby-sitter.\nBy the time the Winters came home, Harriet had eaten most of the M & M\u2019s in the glass bowl on their coffee table: first all the blue ones, then the red ones, then all the green ones, and so on, leaving, in the end, only the yellow.\nThey gave her too much money and didn\u2019t ask her about anything. Mrs. Winter seemed to be waiting for her to leave before checking on the baby. Mr. Winter drove her home in silence. When they reached her house he said, My wife. He hesitated, then he said, You understand, don\u2019t you? and Harriet answered Yes without looking at him or being sure what they were talking about although she did really know what he was telling her and then she got out of his car and watched him drive away.\nKatharine Weber is the author of the novels OBJECTS IN MIRROR ARE CLOSER THAN THEY APPEAR (1995), THE MUSIC LESSON (1999), and THE LITTLE WOMEN (forthcoming in September 2003).

On the counters lay patient fists and arms, like stones from abandoned quarries. Wait, they said, in autumn, the harvest will cry for help, needing those who bend and chop and tie. That season gleaned only people, standing in lines like withered corn, the illusion of summer\u2019s wealth in their hands. By winter, all pretense was fled, along with the sun.

My dad wanted to kill a white cat, a halfbreed albino that lived by night. She must have had some Siamese blood, the way she screamed. He\u2019d stumble through the dark house and damn her mother, who\u2019d been our barn mouser, and her unknown father. He\u2019d fumble with his shotgun and cup his hands around his eyes at the windows. Sometimes she\u2019d be plain in the elm, floating like a ghost, her lambent eyes locked on his before she vanished.\nI loved the way she ticked the old man off. I thought of her as his personal scourge, vengeance in a veil of white fur. I didn\u2019t hate my dad, not much. I only hated the way he fit into the life I loathed, early mornings and country music and the stripe the heavy grain bucket left in my hand when I fed the pigs. I was bristling, my muscles pulling tight, my bones aching as if they contained all my desires. When I was restless in the night I liked to hear the voice of the cat, its ripped-tin edge of murderous love.\nI never told my father her lair was under an old truck among the weeds. I\u2019d climbed out a window to find her one night when her cry came sideways to the wind. I saw her move across the corral like blown snow to her path through the weeds, carved by many passings.\nThe day my dad decided to start that rusted truck he hadn\u2019t used in years, I kept quiet. Our hands dug through the dusty engine in the morning steam and came up skinned and greased. At noon we washed at the hydrant but the black still lay in the life-lines of my palms. My hands had grown long-boned and thick like his; I hated that.\nAfter lunch I followed him back to the truck. He stepped onto the running board and into the cab. I saw scraps of his face through divots in the dusty windshield. The engine kicked but its sound was sliced by a scream that struck me before it fell within the reach of my ears. Then there was only the sputter of the truck. The left side of the hood folded back like a beetle\u2019s wing beneath my hands. The cat\u2019s body lay deep in the shadows, her hair darkened with blood. Her head circled in and out of darkness on a wing of the fan, every circuit bringing the black slashes of her eyes around to face me.\nMy dad cut the engine. I looked into his eyes through pawprints in the dust.","source":"https:\/\/vestalreview.net\/the-white-cat-2\/","source-hostname":"Vestal Review","excerpt":"by Gordon Grice Summer, and me thirteen.

Your favorite one, with the lace edges and sheer bodice, found in the bargain bin, crumpled against all that slick nylon. The one I wore for you the day you got out of prison, the first time, when the sun sank so low in the sky that it seemed to disappear. You said, You look like a black valentine, Baby, and kissed my neck.\nThere was no time for toiletries. I had my little green suitcase, child-sized and pleather, found at a thrift store in Iowa, and inside I had folded the gown carefully. It wasn\u2019t heavy enough to make my hand sweat, the handle just big enough for my fingers to wrap around. I clutched the suitcase as you drove, your knuckles brushing my thigh.\nI should have known, when you made me wait five minutes in the car outside the drugstore, a cement and neon monstrosity. We\u2019d already checked into our room, something that stank of stale cigarettes and Plasticene, the bedspread a slippery vinyl with burgundy flowers. You wanted to go to the drugstore, and I agreed. You said, Happy Anniversary, Baby, and kissed my cheek. I held my green suitcase with my right hand.\nYou were in the bathroom for five minutes, the water running. I stared out the window into the drizzle. You coughed as if you were choking on air. When you came out I could smell the sick days of my childhood on your breath. I could see your dilated pupils like little black suns, the loll of your tongue. Our anniversary punctuated by you downing cold medicine in that yellow light, and me, looking out the window onto wet pavement.\nSo I turned to face you in silence. Your heavy body in the doorway watching mine from on the corner of the bed. You licked my shoulder, and said something about Love, and I felt the heat of your breath travel down my arm. Watching you leave a sticky film on my stomach, rose colored. And after all this, you wandered out in the rain and I slept on the bed that smelled of someone else.\nI woke the next morning to your cherry-pucker, the smudge on your lips that tasted like candy. Your hair still damp from the rain, darkening the white pillowcase. How I couldn\u2019t shake you. How I turned the key in to an aging woman with sparse hair, her hands stained by nicotine. How I held you gently in the afternoon light, tilting your head to receive sips of water. How I never opened my suitcase that night.\nMany thanks to Cate Marvin for her gracious permission to use the line from her poem.\nErica W.
