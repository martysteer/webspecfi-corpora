# webspecfi-corpora

This data repository contains scraped stories from some old and new web zines.

These are or were all public pages, either from the live web or the internet archive. All rights should remain with the original authors and/or the magazines in which their imaginations were published. 

There are some amazing stories in these corpora. Please use them fairly and transparently, and cite your sources.

All these corpora should roughly be the same JSONL and CSV structures, and so can be combined into a larger corpus by concatenating all the corpus.jsonl files together.

Here is the current shape:

The data was scraped using wget and trafilatura, then the automatically detected metadata was manually cleanup a little bit. Some notes of the commands used to produce these are in the README.md files, but I got a little lazy repeating myself over and over, and I have cleaned a lot of my working notes and files out, so I can publish this corpus for others to use. It was created in 2023, so some of the live magazine sites will have newly published literature not contained here.
