The neighborhood grass glows green. This doesn\u2019t look at all like the cyborg farm.\nMy boyfriend is driving. I sit in the backseat with the laundry. I wear human clothes, just like him, and I sort our wearables as we rush onward.\nI also glance out at the many doors, facades, and driveways of our new neighborhood. The houses look the same, except varying in their pastel colorings and differing slightly in height.\nWe arrive at our new house.\nMy greatest hope is that my boyfriend, who of course is a human, will select me for marriage. He says he might, because I have a Protestant work ethic. I once asked what that meant. We women from the cyborg farm do not know about Protestants or other religious sects.\n\u201cIt just means you work hard,\u201d he had replied. I still want to know more, for I find philosophies fascinating.\nWe unpack and settle in and I hope he will tell me. But whenever I allow my recursive brain structures to ponder and explore, and state aloud my queries, he turns on the television.\nI used to write poetry at the cyborg farm. One of my poems went like this: I may be more than half robot, but I have a heart and feel love. When my boyfriend purchased me, he told the owner of the cyborg farm that time is money. I didn\u2019t ask what that meant; I still don\u2019t want to know.\nIn the new house, we have two human housemates. A brunette woman and a blond male. I wear a wig. Otherwise I look perfectly human. But around the housemates, my boyfriend acts differently toward me. He tells them, \u201cWe\u2019re just friends.\u201d\nBut that\u2019s not true. We sleep together most nights, except the nights he rejects me. Then I shiver and cry in my own room, on a narrow bed. I don\u2019t like that room, because there are no lights and it\u2019s very dark. There are no decorations, but I\u2019d like to add some for the nights I have to spend there.\nWatching the three humans play out in the green yard on weekends, I feel my dreams slipping away. I press my face against the window\u2019s cool pane of glass.\nMy boyfriend doesn\u2019t like it here. He calls it \u201csuburban hell.\u201d But I like the yards with their children, dogs, and sprinklers. It\u2019s much nicer than the cyborg farm, stuffed with straw and machinery and factory belts. Perhaps happiness is a fa\u00e7ade, like the one a house has, I tell myself. Once you get past the front of happiness, there is quiet and sadness and doubt.\nI drive to a large building and work there on weekdays. There are engineers, and marketing and science personnel. My boss is a round-faced, complacent man. He meets me daily in the front lobby, and takes me to my office. \u201cProcessor Drone One, it\u2019s good to meet you,\u201d he says to me each time, as if I\u2019ve forgotten. I follow him upstairs and get plugged in to my networking port. I don\u2019t have time to write poetry anymore, not like at the cyborg farm.\n\u201cYou might have noticed half your paycheck is missing,\u201d my boss told me at the end of the first month. \u201cIt\u2019s because we paid that half to Mr. Billingsley.\u201d\nMr. Billingsley is what the world calls my boyfriend. I still work even though my boyfriend gets half my check. I guess this is why he likes my Protestant work ethic. Out of all my tasks at the office, I enjoy writing instruction manuals because I feel the work is more human than machine. Also, when I work on them, I get to sit and look out the windows at the small and tender trees that encircle the building.\nIn the spring, we attend a wedding. My boyfriend tells me he thinks the ceremony is a rather dull proceeding. But I find the exchange of vows and overall atmosphere painfully exquisite. I hold back tears.\nThat night, when he reaches for me in bed, I feel a supreme melancholy. I think: I will never be his wife.\nThe next week, I get a raise! I feel like flying and don\u2019t know what\u2019s next. The sky seems forever blue when I walk on my lunch break. When I go home and tell my boyfriend, he says that he can afford to kick out the housemates, which he then does. \u201cNow there\u2019s no need to pretend between us,\u201d he says. I am glowing. I am really, really hoping for things to be different.\n\u201cI am happy to be a good citizen,\u201d I tell my boyfriend. I trim the trees in the backyard. I cook dinners. He is so tall and handsome, my boyfriend. When he holds me, and I listen for his heartbeat, I feel I can move mountains. I think, one day soon, he might give me an engagement ring. Then I will feel the sort of happiness I only imagine in dreams.\nLate on a Sunday, we are resting up. \u201cI want to go to school, to a real university,\u201d I tell him.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d he says.\n\u201cI can work better if I learn more,\u201d I reply.\nHe frowns. \u201cTrue, but the university is very expensive.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I sigh, and am filled with sadness.\nThen he leads me up to his closet. He opens it. \u201cLook,\u201d he says. Books clutter the closet \u2014 many of them. \u201cThese are my books from engineering school. You can learn all you want,\u201d he says. I jump for happiness.\nHe watches TV a lot. I listen to Brahms and Bach and Hank Williams, trying to understand emotions. Emotions are a curious thing. Do I feel music? When I play music, when my boyfriend is turned away from me and watching television, I feel disturbed by unknown vibrations in my soul.\n\u201cI want for us to get married,\u201d I tell my boyfriend one day. \u201cBecause I like to feel as if I am moving forward, and that makes me feel powerful. If we were married, I would feel as if our love is moving forward too. Perhaps I can even get another work promotion, because I am so happy.\u201d\nI don\u2019t think too much when I say this. But, after those last words emerge from my mouth, he gives me the most curious, sly smile.\nA week later, an engagement ring appears. Six months later, we get married. It\u2019s a civic ceremony, so I never meet his relatives. But I feel, at last, content. My new husband is the world to me.\nOur marriage wears on. Something strange happens to me. I start to forget about my husband a little and start noticing other people again, even more than I used to. I notice the poetry in the lives of people in my busy neighborhood. The elderly Indian couple who hold hands as they walk. The teenage girl who reclines under the weeping willow with her book. Children playing at the park. They shine in their beauty.\nI go out to simply watch. I can\u2019t have children of my own. Now that my situation is stable, and I do not have to be returned to the cyborg farm, watching the children and other people is a relief to me.\nOnce a cyborg is married off, she\u2019s hardly ever returned. Hardly.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Rebellion and fire sweep across the land, the ash settling \"in soft drifts and mounds almost up to the windowsills of the old folk\u2019s home.\"","hostname":"fabulistmagazine.com","source":"https:\/\/fabulistmagazine.com\/ministry-of-presence\/","sitename":"The Fabulist Words & Art","text":"In the mornings the wind would blow the ash in from the east. It would settle in soft drifts and mounds almost up to the windowsills of the old folk\u2019s home.\nMalika began each day by lining up the residents in their wheelchairs at the windows facing west. They would never know of the way that the grayness could settle into your hair, the folds of your clothes, into your very lungs. They never went outside. To them this country could remain as it was, decades in the past. The lush, beautiful island to which the wealthy came to retire.\nIn the evenings, the winds came in from the west. Malika lined the chairs up at the eastern windows. \u201cLook at the sky,\u201d she would tell them. \u201cIs that not a milk-glass sky?\u201d\nThough she had never seen milk glass.\nShe had cared for these same residents since she was ten years old. They all had been in their eighties. Thirty years had passed; they were all now well into their hundred-and-teens. It was said (by certain of them) that it was because Malika had a gift.\n\u201cA gift?\u201d she had asked back when she was sixteen. \u201cA gift for what?\u201d The residents had taught her English over the years, given her many books, and the girl had developed a surprising fluency. She spoke in a high, clear voice with a lilting accent.\n\u201cA gift for describing things,\u201d the old woman had said, \u201cto one who is losing her memories. Which is the truest death, my dear.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cHere,\u201d she handed Malika a framed photograph. \u201cDescribe this.\u201d\n\u201cWell \u2026 it\u2019s you when you were young. Walking down the gangplank of a ship. You\u2019re wearing a long pleated skirt and a silk scarf tied at the throat. The scarf is lifting in the air.\u201d\n\u201cAnd?\u201d The old woman asked, her blind eyes eager. Hopeful.\n\u201cAnd \u2026 there are gulls in the sky. The sky is full of iridescent light. You are giving out light. You are looking around you like you have landed at a distant, wondrous place. You see beauty. Your face reflects it back. I can hear those gulls, their cries ring like crystal. The wind is cool and gentle. It carries away your laughter like delicate glass bubbles, rising\u2014\u201d\nThe old woman nods with her eyes closed, smiling mistily. \u201cIt is almost better to experience it in my mind\u2019s eye. To experience it through your eyes, my dear. When you make me a gift of my own memories, you give me more life.\u201d\nThe old woman, whose name was Rosemary, did not regain her eyesight, but her skin took on a rosy glow. Her appetite improved. She gave Malika, for a gift, a trunk full of embroidered linens and a china service for six. She said now that she was living the life of the mind, she had no need for these possessions anymore.\n* * *\nThe others, too, would ask for her to describe their pasts. Some were easy.\nDescribe my childhood winters in New Haven.\nThey were gentle and hushed, with snowy trees like friendly dragons, and frozen lakes like pools of quicksilver.\nSometimes the requests were more difficult. Describe Baked Alaska. Describe sailing on a topsail schooner, full rigged, right into the bay. Describe highballs on the south lawn at dusk.\nIf she didn\u2019t know what a thing was then she would simply make things up. It sets your jaw tingling with its crackling contrasts. It is like soaring through a tunnel. It is so gentle and honey-sweet it makes you weep. But even then, they didn\u2019t mind. Even then, it gave them pleasure. And it gave Malika pleasure, too. It was like weaving a beautiful dream together, and it felt, to everyone, true.\nTell it to me so that this time I can truly appreciate it.\n* * *\nIt was late in the evening. Malika sat in her own home, at the wood-plank table with her cousin Mira. The laundry was folded. The plates and cups were clean and put away. Malika and Mira and their extended family lived all together in the same blocky, concrete complex.\nThe children and the elderly parents were all asleep. Malika sipped from a cup of bitter, grassy tea and sighed. At forty she still looked much younger. A short, broad woman with golden-brown skin and strong, able arms. She unbound her plaited hair, let it spread along her shoulders, rubbed at her temples to dispel a headache.\n\u201cThe fires have been coming closer today,\u201d said Mira. \u201cThere\u2019s been talk of another coup. But I\u2019ve lost track of all the coups. Sometimes I can\u2019t feel bothered try to make sense of it anymore.\u201d She refilled Malika\u2019s cup. \u201cI worry about you, cousin. You work too hard.\u201d\n\u201cI need the money.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not paying you well enough \u2014 for what you do.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s my duty.\u201d\n\u201cBah! Old rich, spoiled people. They don\u2019t appreciate you.\u201d\nMalika put her head in her hands, took a breath. \u201cThey aren\u2019t so well off. They don\u2019t have much anymore.\u201d\n\u201cThey came to our island back in the colonial days when everything was beautiful. Sopped up all that was good. But when things got bad their people abandoned us \u2014 abandoned them. Called our island dangerous, politically unstable. I can\u2019t believe anyone would leave their elders behind, if that\u2019s the way they see us.\u201d\n\u201cThey can\u2019t help what happened to them! And they rely on me!\u201d\nMira disregarded her with a flip of her hand. \u201cI can\u2019t help my feelings. Those people make me mad! They say anyone ignorant enough to burn down their own country deserves the misfortune they get!\u201d\n\u201cOh, who says that?\u201d asked Malika quietly, shaking her head, but thinking of the shouting, the looting, the winds of ash. Thinking of the glow of fire in the horizon.\nMira reached across the table, cupped Malika\u2019s chin. \u201cCousin. It is a fact that those people you care for should have passed on a long time ago. You keep them tied to this earth and it isn\u2019t right. The natives won\u2019t go near that building. They think you\u2019re a witch. That\u2019s the only reason the place hasn\u2019t burned.\u201d\n* * *\nAll the next day Malika felt preoccupied. Indignant. Replaying Mira\u2019s words in her mind and feeling anger like a hot coal in her gut.\nAs the residents were eating lunch, Malika heard someone enter through the main door.\nThe front foyer was still impressive despite its shabbiness. The windows were tall and stately, though they rattled. The marble tiles of the floor needed polishing. Backlit by the sun, she saw the silhouettes of two men. Family members visiting loved ones? That was something she hadn\u2019t seen in years.\nThese two men were dressed in slacks and button-down shirts, but no ties. One carried a slightly frayed nylon briefcase. Both had their hair buzzed close to the scalp. When they greeted her and shook her hand, they spoke English.\n\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d\n\u201cYou are the caretaker here?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cMay we observe?\u201d One, the smaller one, gestured to the dining room.\nMalika felt the stirrings of dread. She wasn\u2019t used to outsiders. \u201cFeel free, but may I ask why?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard wonderful things about you, and just want to observe your good work.\u201d\nShe felt puzzled, and unnerved. But the two men merely stood in the doorway of the dining room, watching. The taller one was unsmiling and sharp eyed. The smaller one, however, watched the elderly people dining together with a soft, open expression on his face, fondly smiling.\nAfter some minutes, they turned away and came back to Malika.\n\u201cAre you the only one that works here?\u201d\n\u201cWe have a cook and the boy who stays overnight.\u201d\n\u201cWe count six residents.\u201d\n\u201cThere used to be \u2026 oh I would say twenty, when I was a girl. But when the troubles came, and things started to change, people thought it was dangerous. Many took their loved ones out.\u201d\nThe men nodded. The tall one said, \u201cMuch has changed, with the new order.\u201d\nMalika felt beads of sweat dripping down her back. \u201cAre you inspectors of some sort?\u201d\nThe smaller one shook his head, took a business card from his pocket and handed it to Malika. Jeff Mallard. Fenway Logistics Agency.\n\u201cWe have heard about you, Miss Malika. We know you have special talents, and you are reliable.\u201d\n\u201cWe are a recruitment agency,\u201d said the tall one brusquely, looking her in the eye boldly. \u201cWe could offer you an opportunity to make far more money than you do now. Three times the money \u2014 if you\u2019re willing to travel overseas.\u201d\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Malika frowned at the card and shook her head. \u201cI know what kind of operation you are. You work for your government, don\u2019t you? And you come to all of the poor countries to recruit cheap labor! I\u2019ve known people that got involved.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d said the smaller man. \u201cThis is something different. We\u2019re interested especially in you. \u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not interested in flipping burgers on your military bases!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what we want you for,\u201d said the tall one, firmly.\n\u201cWe want \u2026\u201d the small one sighed. \u201cWe want you to do the same kind of work that you do now. The same thing you do here.\u201d He took out a sheet of paper from his briefcase and wrote down a figure. \u201cThis is what we would pay you. There are no tricks. You will have a real work permit. If you change your mind, airfare will be provided home.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to work at an old age home?\u201d\nThe tall one glowered. \u201cWe must keep the details confidential. I will just tell you, that someone has requested you. Specifically.\u201d\n\u201cSo you won\u2019t even tell me what exactly you want me for? I\u2019m sorry. Goodbye. I\u2019ve heard enough.\u201d\n\u201cPlease,\u201d said the small one. \u201cKeep my card. Think it over.\u201d He zipped up the briefcase. \u201cWe\u2019ll come back in a couple of days to see what you decide.\u201d Each man shook her hand. She walked them to the door, shutting it firmly behind them.\nOf all things, she muttered. She and the residents were happy in this world they had created.\n\u201cPlease, Miss Malika?\u201d asked the old man who she had just helped settle into an armchair.\n\u201cWhat is it, George?\u201d\nThough wizened, his body was delicate and beautiful, nearly weightless in Malika\u2019s strong arms. \u201cI\u2019m having trouble. I can\u2019t remember my wedding night. It\u2019s slipping away from me.\u201d He gripped her arm.\nMalika smiled. It was a delicate balance. The secret was not to try to hard. The secret was not to be too direct. If she would look askance, the feelings and the images would rise up on their own. It felt to her like coming home.\n\u201cAh, George. Your wedding night. You are young, your collar is loose about your neck. The ring cold and new on your finger. You and your bride walk down a long hallway, wallpapered with watermarked rose silk. She has rice in her hair. At last you open the door to your room, where you turn to her and remove her tiny dove gray hat with its spotted veil. Her face is a brand new vista. And you are looking straight into it, standing in your new, stiff, shiny black shoes.\u201d\nShe had done this so many times before. So why now was it bringing tears to her eyes? Why was her throat catching so she couldn\u2019t continue?\n* * *\nThe evening sun stained the sky tangerine. Ash blew in tufts, flickering at the edge of her eyesight like large flapping birds. When she arrived home she was surprised to find her younger brother Raj sitting on the crumbling steps. Between his knees was a green bottle of whiskey with a gold-ribboned neck. Expensive. He never told them how he got such things.\nShe sat beside him, and he smiled at her. His face was pointed and foxy, and the knife scar on his cheek made him look dashing. His eyes were feral, his fuzz of black hair like fur. She missed her little brother. He disappeared for weeks at a time. It was always a happy shock to find him arrived at home again.\nHe offered her the bottle. She rolled her eyes, but then took a quick sip. It tasted of oak and amber. A warm tawniness, like the sky. Like the moment.\nThey sat quietly, looking at the glowing sky, drinking from the bottle, and Malika felt loose and easy. She asked, \u201cGuess what happened today?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cTwo men came to see me at work. English speakers. They offered me a job overseas.\u201d She giggled.\n\u201cDoing what?\u201d Raj scowled, leaning back on his long skinny arms.\n\u201cWell, I suppose being some kind of caretaker like I am now. They were awfully vague.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re vague because they want to trick you. Trick you into slave labor, for third world wages! Tell me you kicked their asses.\u201d\n\u201cThis is different, I think,\u201d Malika wasn\u2019t sure how to explain. \u201cThey said they knew who I was, and that they wanted me for something special. They aren\u2019t asking me to apply or pay a fee. This actually seemed for real.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t believe it, sister. All tricks.\u201d\nIt was a mistake to have told him. Raj was young and angry, passionate in his convictions. Though they never discussed it, she knew he was one of those who burned buildings, threw homemade bottle bombs into windows.\n\u201cWell, maybe they do know who I am! And I do have a gift. I keep my residents alive and vibrant and happy.\u201d\n\u201cAt what price, sister? You live your life for them. What do you have to show for all your devotion?\u201d Raj chuckled. \u201cChina service for six? Pearl choker? Brandy snifter?\u201d\nShe squared her shoulders, put her hands on her hips. \u201cShut your mouth! I don\u2019t ask for those things. They give them to me as gifts. Because I\u2019m good at my job!\u201d\nHe called as she walked away: \u201cIt\u2019s like you don\u2019t even know who the enemy is!\u201d\nMalika sat on her bed, glowering. Her brother\u2019s youthful idealism made her feel old and dull witted and foolish. Her anger \u2014 at nothing, at everything and everybody \u2014 had been growing all day long.\nHer room was spare and simple, a single bed pushed up against a bare wall. But it did also contain the box full of china. The steamer trunk that held the embroidered linens and the silken wedding trousseau. Another flat box, under her bed, held the odds and ends. The riding gloves, the opera glasses. The rings and necklaces. All of it looked like something raided from a tomb. Such dead, inert objects from a time long gone. But somehow full of the possibilities of life. Someone else\u2019s life.\nShe was wrong, keeping them alive all this time. Prisoners of time. They didn\u2019t even know what lay outside their window. Tears sprung to her eyes for the second time that day. She unwound a string of pearls and coiled it into her hand, burying her hot face in their soothing coolness.\n* * *\nThe next afternoon Malika was straightening up the games room when she felt a presence. She turned and saw one of the men from the day before. The smaller one, the one she liked.\nShe gave him a cold little smile, not stopping what she was doing. \u201cBack again, I see. Can\u2019t take no for an answer? They sent you to break me?\u201d\nHe shrugged, leaning in the doorway. \u201cI just wanted to see if you had thought it over.\u201d His hands were in his pockets, his briefcase at his feet. \u201cYou know, I also wanted to assure you that this is a legitimate offer we are making. We do know you. A member of our staff has a family member living here.\u201d\n\u201cWho? Whose family member?\u201d\nHe did not answer. After a time he said, \u201cI can pull out the contracts. We can go over them. Just you and me. What do you say?\u201d\nShe looked at him, pursed her lips. Was about to cut him down with sharp words. But then she surprised herself when instead she said, \u201cI could sit down with you. For a short time. If you come back in the evening.\u201d\n* * *\nThere were sure to be reasons, many reasons, that Malika found herself, gate pass in hand, sitting in a hard plastic chair at the tiny airport. The words were there, but she could not articulate them. She sat resolute and straight in her chair. Her face looked set and defiant. The hand that held the piece of paper gripped it tightly and damply. Every once in a while her lips quivered like a jolt of current shot through them.\nDon\u2019t bother to explain, she\u2019d said to the man the evening that he came back with the paperwork. You don\u2019t have to tell me where I\u2019m going. I don\u2019t want to know where I\u2019m going. I\u2019ve decided to leave. To know any more might cause me to change my mind.\nAt long last it was time to board. She had no family to tell her goodbye, they were all too upset by her decision. She followed the other passengers into the cabin of the plane. She carried nothing but a small canvas bag. She had checked her one small suitcase \u2014 vintage, embossed calfskin that a 115-year-old woman had given to her, in exchange for Malika lovingly describing the trips that the suitcase had been on.\nShe had never been on a plane in her life. It felt cramped and somehow alien. She closed her eyes and pretended she was on the dusty city bus.\nThe plane pulled away, slowly, and it was okay. But when it started to gain speed down the runway, Malika became afraid. It gave her a queer sensation of instability, as though her atoms were coming apart. She wrapped her arms around herself and closed her eyes.\nThe take off into the air made her feel sick in her stomach. I could die, she thought. I could die today. Surely it could not be natural to be so high up. There, down below, was the chain of islands that had been her home. First it tilted up alarmingly, and she could see the lush trees, the ruined, burned out condos and hotels along the beach.\nOn the other side, the slums where her family lived, tiny and distinct. Then it began to grow smaller and smaller, and then it was gone.\nShe had thought that this was what she\u2019d wanted, but she instead felt paralyzed. The old folks would surely not understand or forgive.\nIn times of greatest fear and confusion, images of her mother would often come unbidden into her head. She had drowned herself when Malika was ten; her father said it was because she was a whore, and ashamed of herself.\nHer mother had been a maid at one of the beautiful hotels on the white-sanded beach. For her job she always wore the regulation dress made of stiff black fabric, its skirt standing out like a lampshade. Stockings and square toed shoes. A beautiful woman. Men loved to look, to touch her on the arm. The timid smile never left her anxious face. No one could believe she had it in her. When she washed up on the beach her expression looked so different. It was one of stunned surprise and wonder.\nThese were things Malika tried never to think about. It was so pleasurable to live through other people\u2019s memories that she didn\u2019t ever have to contemplate what it had been like \u2014 to see her own mother wrapped in blankets on the kitchen table, the family weeping, her father looking away to spit on the floor. Malika herself sitting in a corner, numbly focusing on a stray orange seed that was pulsating with ants.\nShe opened her bag and took out at her travel documents. The employment papers. The letter of authorization. Her passport. She held these things, stroked them with her finger. These things were all that would give her an identity from now on.\nShe lay her head back and closed her eyes. Dreaming of gunfire and shouting in the streets. Breaking glass and ash drifting in the wind.\n* * *\nWhen her plane landed, she felt disoriented. Everything was seen through a haze of unreality. A young girl in full army fatigues was gesturing to her. Whose daughter was this? She was red haired, snub nosed. The military garb and the gun on her slim hip seemed a joke. She was fresh faced, smiling, motioning for Malika to come.\nShe helped retrieve her bag, then led her to a waiting minibus. It was full of civilians, but no one spoke. Malika looked out the windows. They were moving through an urban landscape, it was dark, the streets were empty.\nTheir destination was a large metal building behind an electric gate. Inside there were partitions and paper-covered beds. Women in medical scrubs circulated with clipboards. Malika had her blood drawn. Her lungs were listened to. She received a series of shots.\n\u201cWhat are these for?\u201d\n\u201cYou need these immunizations for when you fly out tomorrow,\u201d the nurse told her. \u201cMeanwhile, you\u2019ll rest here until we get everything in order.\nAnd she did sleep, on a cot in a row of other cots with other people, men and women, all speaking different languages. She pulled the rough blanket over her face and willed it all to go away.\nIt was hard to tell when morning came, as there were no windows. Everyone was told to prepare themselves, it would be time to board soon.\nMalika felt a leaden heaviness in her chest. Homesickness. Before she made another step, before time and events hurtled forward again, she just had to do one more thing.\nShe saw the girl who had picked her up from the airport and raised her hand. \u201cExcuse me? Would it be possible for me to make a phone call before we leave?\u201d\nThree rings. Four. Maybe no one would answer. The phone, which was on top of an empty desk in a tiny office, felt strange and oversized in her hand.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\u201cMira! It\u2019s me. I just wanted to check in because I don\u2019t know where I\u2019ll be tomorrow. I am safe, everything is okay!\u201d\nSilence.\n\u201cPlease, say something Mira. Does anyone miss me? Though it\u2019s only been two days?\u201d\n\u201cOf course we miss you, cousin.\u201d\n\u201cAnd \u2026 I was anxious to know, they had a new woman. To, you know, take over my job? Have you heard anything? I hope she is trustworthy. And things are going well?\u201d\nThis time the silence was longer. Then Mira let out a long sigh. \u201cI hate to tell you this. The old folk\u2019s home is no more.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Her heart pounded.\n\u201cBecause the residents are no more. The new caregiver arrived in the morning. She claimed that they had all turned to dust in their beds.\u201d Mira whispered her words, they sounded dry and brittle in Malika\u2019s ear. \u201cShe screamed so loud they heard her in the streets. She opened the windows, she said, to let their spirits escape. The dust, according to her, lifted and blew into the wind, mixing into the clouds of ash. No one was there to witness. But the islanders are satisfied. It\u2019s best for all concerned.\u201d\nMalika\u2019s mind went bright and blank, her eyes lingered upward on a spiderweb hanging from the fluorescent light tubing. The phone\u2019s mouthpiece slipped from her fingers with a thud. Still she could hear a voice calling, \u201cMalika! Can you hear me?\u201d\n* * *\nThe final flight was on a small rickety military plane. But Malika saw nothing, heard nothing. Instead, she was trying to remember the chill of a long-ago Connecticut winter. The smell of oil on a horse\u2019s saddle and its smoothness under the hand. The pastel paper petals that fell from the ceiling at a debutant ball.\nAll of these things and others she tried to breath life into, so that they would balloon out, larger than life. She tried and she failed. The magic was not there anymore. These memories were turning to dust, as had their source. She couldn\u2019t believe it. Nothing else in her life had been permanent: These things had always seemed to be.\nThe rest of the trip went by in a blur of jumbled images. Trucks, barren highways, barbed wire fences. She was like a blind and deaf woman, lead forward by those around her.\nAll that she knew was that she was on a military base. She sat with others on plastic chairs in a large tent. At one point an ID tag with her own face on it was hung around her neck by yet another young girl in uniform. \u201cIt\u2019s your time now. You will be working with the chaplain,\u201d she said quietly as she led her out.\nShe was taken to another large tent. It was odd looking, with wooden doors on the front painted to look like stained glass.\nInside was a man in camouflage, standing facing away with his arms behind his back. Then he turned. He had large black eyebrows, a large curving nose like a scythe. Eyes that were liquid and dark, startling in their look of wounded vulnerability. On one side of his chest was stitched a name, Edwards. On the other side was an embroidered cross.\nAn expression of earnest hope spread over his face. His brow quivered and puckered upward. \u201cMiss Malika?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d She felt stymied. What did this man expect?\n\u201cYou can call me Chaplain Mathew. I\u2019m so glad you decided to come. \u201c\n\u201cAre you the one that requested me?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nShe laughed.\nHe looked gravely into her eyes. \u201cI run what I call a ministry of presence. And I felt that you would be the best one to assist me. I do what I can, as much as I can, for the people who need me. But there are some, so far gone that I can\u2019t reach them, and I thought \u2014\u201d\nHe clasped his large hands together, looked down at them. \u201cMaybe you would help me. Help us.\u201d\n\u201cHelp who?\u201d\n\u201cHelp them. They\u2019re so young!\u201d He put an arm on her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll show you.\u201d\nHe took her to another, larger, sprawling tent that seemed to go on for acres. This was the hospital. There were physicians and nurses rushing around between the nylon flaps that divided the rooms. There were computer screens of bone scans. There was the whirring and clicking of dozens of machines.\nThey walked through a maze that twisted and turned until Chaplain Matthew finally stopped. He sighed and opened a partition and motioned her in.\nThe room was very large. And in it were rows and rows of soldiers lying on cots. A few girls, but mostly boys. None looked older than twenty. Mere children. But there was an unsettling stillness about them. It didn\u2019t seem natural for one so young to have such a heavy inertness. And the eyes. Those young, clear, bright eyes seemed to have been fogged over. As though the shock of seeing something unthinkable had seared away their vision. They looked ancient. Each lay in state like a sarcophagus.\n\u201cWe have so many of them now. No one knows for sure what it is. They are testing for toxins, gas, but I feel it is a more spiritual malaise.\u201d\n\u201cAre they suffering?\u201d\n\u201cThey are having neurological problems. They are losing their memory. Growing more far away every day. I can\u2019t get through to them. I need you to help them remember.\u201d\nMalika approached one. A boy still young enough to have acne. Large ears, a stalk of a neck. And yet those eyes \u2026 they swiveled up to meet her own. There was something weathered and desperate in them. In this boy\u2019s head were the eyes of a man who had lived centuries.\nThe Chaplain took her by the arm, looking rather desperate himself.\n\u201cI think, maybe, these children have seen too much. And I know that you, too, have seen too much. And I pray for you and your country and I wish I could \u2014\u201d he stopped, running out of breath. \u201cWhat I want to ask is. Will you? Have mercy on us, in spite of it all? Help them to remember who they are?\u201d\nShe gave the Chaplain a long look, pressing her lips together. She looked around at this room with white billowing walls, the young bodies lying prone and silent. She thought of home and her family. They things they would say to her, another dirt-poor islander used by the enemy. Her little brother would look away in disgust!\nShe thought of the old folk\u2019s home, swallowed by flame, the wicker chaise settees and gracious wheeled tea caddies and the residents themselves \u2014 all ash now, everything that was gentle and gracious now blowing away in the hot wind.\nShe leaned again over the boy. In one pink, big knuckled hand he held a St Christopher\u2019s medal. She put her hand over his, was overcome by the sensation of being knocked down by a wave. She felt the need of the young\/old boy flare up her arm, through her veins. Her soul felt as though it were falling forward, and at the same time hurtling into the past.\n\u201cYou are ten years old,\u201d she whispered to him hoarsely. \u201cIt\u2019s a summer evening. You are lying on the grass. Your parents are murmuring nearby over drinks. You are able to see the setting sun and a pale sliver of moon, both at once. You feel gravity pull you tight and safe to the earth. At the same time, you see distant stars emerging, and hear the singing of planets. The moment is perfect. The moment is your friend.\u201d\nThere was a catch in her voice, her eyes shift and falter, but just for an instant.\nShe squeezed his hand, almost pleading.\nLeah Erickson has had her work published in a wide array of literary magazines and journals, including The Saint Ann\u2019s Review, The Summerset Review, Forge Journal, Eclectica, and The Coachella Review.

The first virtual child has been put into cold storage.\nLara Barta-Fougere (VC), the first virtual child and debut product of now-defunct MaMaSolutions, has been tranferred to a server storage facility in Niagara Falls, according to a spokesperson for Karachi, Pakistan\u2013based DataConclude. The subject of the \u201930s Barta-Fougere scandal is, virtually speaking, no more.\nIt is difficult to conjure now the world that produced Baby Lara in 2031. The legal latticework, the VC school programs, the VC social stacks\u2014all of this was yet to be.\nBecause the virtual-child industry was unveiled to the public (and Congress) as a sophisticated therapy for mothers who had miscarried or lost their biological children, its critics were few. (It was also, for a time, presented as an environmentally sound alternative to a carbon footprint\u2013producing human child.)\nBut insiders at MaMaSolutions soon leaked what many had quietly suspected from the start: Most of the clients were very affluent women in their 30s who couldn\u2019t find a suitable partner or who simply wanted to \u201ctest-drive\u201d parenthood.\nJeremy and Catherine Barta-Fougere (now divorced), each extraordinarily successful as a maverick venture capitalist, used their own money to start MaMaSolutions.\n\u201cIt was an incredibly exciting time, a really beautiful time,\u201d said Mrs. Barta-Fougere from her home in St. Kitts. \u201cWe were bringing in geneticists, people from the virtual-pet space in Japan, child development specialists, hologram artists from the Rhode Island School of Design. To have them all at one big table interacting, the buzz was just incredible. We knew we were on the brink of something truly revolutionary. I wouldn\u2019t trade that time for anything.\u201d\nThe power couple submitted their own DNA for combination, and the code for a physically probable baby, embedded with a normal human growth-trajectory algorithm, was attained within six months.\nThe legal birthdate of the first virtual child, projected via hologram into the company\u2019s main conference room in Manhattan, was March 11, 2031.\nTwo months later, Mrs. Barta-Fougere learned she was actually pregnant.\nAnyone alive in 2036 knows what happened next: Au pair Zehra Demir filed a complaint with New York child protection services alleging that the Barta-Fougeres had, for all intents and purposes, abandoned their biological son Thomas for their virtual daughter.\n\u201cThey would just take off,\u201d says Demir, now an associate professor of regional planning at Istanbul Technical University, via telephone. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I was a live-in. They wouldn\u2019t even bother calling me after the fact. I\u2019d wake up, Thom would be crying, and the place was empty. I\u2019d have to go onto [the Barta-Fougeres\u2019] media accounts just to see their coordinates, and then you could see: Not only were they on some other continent, but they were spending all their time with Lara.\u201d\nDomestic scandal was not only speed bump in the couple\u2019s lives at that time. The industry that MaMaSolutions had spawned now presented that company with fierce competition from virtual-child firms and products offering a more personalized parenting experience: fewer bodily functions, the ability to edit out flaws of character or appearance, and the ability to mute VCs\u2019 emotional needs.\nIn 2037, Demir began proceedings to adopt Thomas Barta-Fougere away from his parents. By 2039 she succeeded, and returned with the child to her native Turkey.\nNow known as Mehmet Demir and an Islamic scholar in Ankara, the Barta-Fougeres\u2019 biological son was not available for comment. However, his adoptive mother reports that Mrs. Barta-Fougere has repeatedly tried to reach him in the past year. Zehra Demir declines to state whether Mehmet has responded.\n\u201cYou know, you try to talk to these people,\u201d says the former au pair. \u201cYou try to say, look, you\u2019ve got a completely distorted view of reality. But [the Barta-Fougeres] are the kind of people, if you don\u2019t have money, they just can\u2019t imagine you could have anything intelligent to say.\u201d\nMaMaSolutions spiralled into insolvency in 2040 after being sued by the family of Rebecca Liu, one of a handful of women who did purchase a virtual child for purposes of grief therapy following several miscarriages. Liu\u2019s depression instead worsened, culminating in her suicide in 2038 at age 29. The Barta-Fougeres won the case, but by then, similar stories had begun to surface and gain press coverage. The reputational damage to the company was irreversible, even as other VC firms were experiencing exponential growth.\nSources conflict as to why the couple gradually began neglecting their virtual daughter as well.\n\u201cI think the \u201930s were just an incredibly difficult time for them,\u201d says Dahlia Mangrove, CEO of Mangrove Capital Group and a close personal friend of the family. \u201cNo parent is perfect, so I\u2019m certainly not going to judge. I think as time went on, though, they started to associate Lara with failure. I mean, Lara was MaMaSolutions in a way. When the company went under they had her transferred to another one, but it was never quite the same, as you can imagine. Imagine the humiliation! I support Jeremy\u2019s decision to cold-storage her. You have to move on.\u201d\nMedical and academic criticism of the virtual-child phenomenon has since evolved into a formidable body of work, but for now the VC cold-storaged last weekend\u2014as of this month an attractive, college-aged young woman seemingly capable of expressing independent views, just as her parents had programmed her to evenutally do\u2014has changed our landscape forever. Few prep schools are without a VC program (Choate Rosemary Hall, in fact, reports it is their only growth area of enrollment, and they are not alone) and the VC playgound spinoff industry alone is worth $2 trillion as of last fiscal quarter.\n\u201cYeah, I guess there was always some moral hysteria around the whole thing from day one,\u201d says Mr. Barta-Fougere from his estate in Montauk, New York. Following his divorce and the MaMaSolutions bankruptcy, the entrepreneur then turned his talents to the burgeoning VC auxiliary-needs market. He has since remarried. \u201cBut come on. We\u2019ve made so many tens of thousands of people happy. I have no regrets. None whatever. This is about evolution.\u201d\nFloral tributes to Lara Barta-Fougere (VC) and memorial donations to ChipEd, which works to bring hologram-based charter schooling to Cambodia, may be sent to DataConclude, 500 Industrial Parkway, Niagara Falls, New York.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Fallen branches crunched underfoot. A honeyed sunlight spilled in through the trees, glazing the forest in an amber glow.\nThe air was redolent with that easy blend of charcoal and pine. She listened to her favorite album as she walked, but her thoughts had drifted when it got to the best part, so she skipped back to the beginning to start fresh.\nIt was always like that for her. No matter how eagerly she awaited something, she never enjoyed the moment once it arrived, because by then she was already waiting for the next. Sometimes, the anxiety of missing out led her to overcorrect, to ground herself so sturdily in the present that she lost sight of anything past her nose, like the massive spider web \u2014 and its resident massive spider \u2014 ahead of her, glinting threads unnoticed until they were wrapped across her face and \u2014\nThe air was redolent with that easy blend of charcoal and pine. She listened to birdsong as she walked, careful to avoid the spiderwebs that spiraled between the trees at eye level. Though she had a proclivity for identifying patterns, she found no semblance of order in the birds\u2019 scattered jigsaw melodies. It seemed more like the disjointed free-for-all of an orchestra tuning up before a rehearsal. Still, there was a kind of accidental beauty to it.\nWhen the lakehouse was in sight, she texted her mom that she was almost there \u2014 just enough notice for everyone to frantically dive behind the furniture. Surprise parties were more fun for the conspirators, and she wanted them to have the thrill of pulling it off by the skin of their teeth. She approached from the north side, so if her shock didn\u2019t seem genuine she could always admit she\u2019d recognized Janelle\u2019s grungy Corolla parked down the road. But after she walked in and they exploded from their hiding places, nobody questioned her practiced squeal of delight. They would all have a better time if they believed it was genuine.\nIt helped that everyone was already a few drinks deep. Which is why she hadn\u2019t originally noticed the stumble in her father\u2019s step when he swept her up into a spinning embrace as he crooned half-remembered lyrics from Dylan\u2019s Forever Young. Her buddies from undergrad didn\u2019t give her a chance to dwell on it. They swarmed in for a group hug that would have toppled under their joyous momentum were it not for the support of her sober footing in the middle. It was as much their celebration as hers. She was the last in her circle of friends to turn twenty-one\u2014despite being the first to earn her degree\u2014and now the whole gang could hit the bars together.\nShe didn\u2019t often mix friends with family, so watching the crossover of these separate worlds felt like living out a surreal dream. Her dad was loving it, though, whipping out all his classic dad jokes for the new appreciative audience that had gathered around the grill.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not the best sausages I\u2019ve grilled,\u201d he quipped, \u201cbut I\u2019ve done bratwurst.\u201d\nShe and her mom never looked more alike than when they rolled their eyes in unison, as they did now. They\u2019d both heard that one so many times it was almost funny.\nWhen the sausages were ready, her dad made a big show of crafting her sandwich to perfection\u2014extra mustard, extra sauerkraut, just the way she liked. \u201cHere ya go, Giuseppe,\u201d he said as he so graciously bestowed it upon her. Everybody was a Giuseppe to him in those days, from the talking heads on his cable news programs to the squirrels who stymied his efforts to defend the birdfeeder from their pillages. One of his charming idiosyncrasies forever tainted by hindsight. On many sleepless nights to come, she would audit every memory from that period and speculate over the missed hints of early symptoms, finding red flags everywhere.\nSomebody had brought a bluetooth speaker, but it was low on battery and missing its charger, so they ate in silence as the food overtook the conversation. She hated the sounds of eating. The ugly, chugging rumble of ingestion that exposed the latent machinery of the human body and always triggered her into fretting over the flimsy assemblage of wires and ducts inside us that can so easily break down like a\nSomebody had brought a bluetooth speaker, and fortunately she had a spare charger in her bag. She showed her mom how to pair it with a phone, and in doing so condemned herself to a lifetime serving as the family\u2019s resident IT specialist. \u201cSo that\u2019s the kind of top secret intel you\u2019ve been studying at the lab, eh?\u201d her mom said, only half joking. Her research was a subject of great mystery to the family, but there wasn\u2019t much point in explaining the vast and \u2014 one would think \u2014 obvious differences between quantum physics and basic tech savviness. For all they knew, the entire landscape of scientific studies was a single field that centered on the recovery of forgotten iPhone passwords.\nOnce the party\u2019s central glob of attendees trickled out into smaller conversations, she and the gang made their way to the lake. Most of them still needed time to digest and stayed on the shore to nurse their food comas under the narcotic sunlight. Gordon kept proposing boozy twists on classic swimming pool games, and she eventually bet him a shooter of Fireball that she could hold her breath underwater longer than him.\nWith Matthew judging from the dock, they dove off at his count of three. She let herself sink all the way to the bottom and concentrated on the silky ribbons of mud threading between her toes to distract from the panicked urge-to-live stampeding in her lungs. Then she realized that the muck had formed a suction grip around both her ankles and tried to shimmy free, but the more she thrashed, the deeper she sank, until her flailing hands caught at the dock and she tore herself upward, choking on the dirty water in a coughing fit so violent that\nWith Matthew judging from the dock, they dove off at his count of three. She resurfaced immediately and gave him a wink. Then they all had a laugh when Gordon splashed out almost a full minute later to find her lounging in a deck chair, sipping her drink at a leisurely pace.\nTheir laughter grew even louder back at the lakehouse, where her mild, oatmeal family was listening to Odd Future\u2014apparently the result of her father\u2019s hapless search for an oldie\u2019s playlist on Spotify. It was just perfect. The sight of her parents trying to make the most of it with a slow dance \u2014 and her friends swapping in to show them some new moves \u2014 was a memory she would cherish for the rest of her life. Everyone was thoroughly tipsy by that point, so Janelle brought out the pack of floss she carried everywhere. She was studying to be a dental hygienist and would often use these sort of shindigs as an opportunity to hone her skills. And no matter how many times a friend flosses your teeth to the beat of Tyler the Creator, you never do get used to it.\nSweaty and sated from dancing, she and Matthew sprawled out on a hammock at the edge of the woods to watch the sun set. The sky obliged them with a flashy ripple of psychedelic whorls. They started talking about their post-college plans, and Matthew admitted that after spending most of his time bouncing between majors, he had no idea where the future might take him.\nThen he noticed her eyes and asked what was wrong, so she made up a hasty excuse about the pollen count. There was no easy way to explain how much she envied his blithe, linear unknowing. One more addition for the teetering heap of secrets she could never share with the people she loved.\nShe continued to lay there long after the sun dipped behind the mountains, watching as Gordon and Mae giggled away from the party and snuck into the backseat of his car. She didn\u2019t bother to intervene this time. That was one mess that would need to work itself out. Even the lab director would have to admire the Herculean restraint she exercised in this rare act of noninterference\u2014if he knew what she was actually up to.\nIt was clear by now that the director didn\u2019t have the slightest clue what she\u2019d been doing with her reiterations. On the first of December, he will recruit her for his revolutionary experiment as usual, and \u2014 in a histrionic speech that she almost knew by heart \u2014 warn her that she must do everything possible to preserve the original timeline when she embarks on the especially risky test run.\nWith a solemn nod, she will promise to maintain the role of a neutral observer \u2014 just as she had the first time, when the promise was still heavy with sincerity. What she will not mention, is that she already completed the test run ages ago, that his original timeline is actually a palimpsest that\u2019s been edited beyond recognition.\nShe\u2019d long muted the ethical alarms that were blaring that first time she looped back to the recruitment date, when she\u2019d somehow changed the outcome of a college football game. The director\u2019s obliviousness to her alteration\u2014as well as the trial itself\u2014let her see how this was all just like the time she\u2019d lost Pecorino.\nLittle Rino, the only pet she\u2019d been allowed as a child, was the pint-sized, pita-colored, Greatest Mouse Of All Time. She\u2019d sobbed her way through an entire Kleenex box the day he escaped from his cage, and then danced with such unbridled ecstasy when she found him later that night that the downstairs neighbors complained.\nIt wasn\u2019t until the next week that her family realized their apartment had a serious mouse problem. And although she never questioned it at the time, years later she would wonder whether the squirming little rodent who returned to Rino\u2019s cage was the original or an impostor. Like Rino, the mouse she\u2019d found cowering under the dryer was pint-sized, pita-colored, and the Greatest Mouse Of All Time, yet for all she knew, her parents might have tossed the real Pecorino down the garbage chute after snapping his neck in a trap.\nShe understood now that there never was a real Pecorino \u2014 only the idea of one. Just like the original timeline was only an idea.\nEven if it came first, it was no more authentic than any of the others she\u2019d doctored. And no better or worse, either. For despite her best efforts to undo the textbook disasters of her lifetime, the branches of each new timeline she crafted would inevitably veer toward tragedy, like tree limbs groping for sunlight. Whenever she managed to trace a tornado back to its butterfly, swatting it out was as futile as a game of whack-a-mole. In every reiteration, towns would get razed by wildfires, cities would sink into the ocean, and unsuspecting human bodies would become the nesting grounds for inoperable tumors.\nSo on this, her umpteenth reiteration, all she wanted was to get a single day right. Just one. If she could pull that off, maybe there was hope for the rest of this rotten timeline. She was getting so close. In fact, this latest attempt was nearly perfect. Except now that it was almost midnight, she suddenly realized that there was still so much room for improvement, so much for her to fine-tune, so much for\nShe left the path and stepped into the woods.

His hair was the shade of dirty ashes and his skin greasy as old tallow. He wore weathered clothes washed of all color. All his possessions fit in a small shoulder bag that was as tattered as he was. My heart sank to look at him.\nAt that time my father was entering his dotage. A lifelong martyr to kindness, he was delighted when the mendicant man knocked at our farmhouse door to beg a bed of hay in the barn.\n\u201cOf course! Rest, by all means. I\u2019ll bring you some bread and cheese.\u201d\nIt was I who took the platter, of course. I found the man sitting against the barn wall with his feet resting on a sack of grain, a small wooden fife in his hand. He wiped a tear from his cheek as I entered, and gave a weak smile.\n\u201cThank you, lad. You and your father are very kind.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cI\u2019m Klement. Father says you can stay for a few days if you need to. Are you headed somewhere, sir?\u201d\n\u201cJoachim,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd no. Not specifically. I\u2019m looking for something that I can\u2019t seem to find.\u201d\n\u201cTreasure?\u201d I asked.\nHe grinned as though I\u2019d said something wonderful.\n\u201cNot quite. A tune.\u201d\nHe raised the fife to his lips and blew a few sweet notes that made my chest swell with joy. Father played a lute sometimes, and we all sang as we worked in the fields, but this was different. This was divine. When he stopped playing my eyes filled with tears of disappointment.\n\u201cYou like it?\u201d\n\u201cOf course. It\u2019s wonderful.\u201d\n\u201cYes. One day I\u2019ll have it right, I think.\u201d\n\u201cThen what will you do?\u201d\n\u201cEntertain people. Children, like you. There\u2019s a town on the other side of the mountain and I promised everyone there I would come back one day and give a performance they\u2019d never forget.\u201d\n\u201cIs that your hometown?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d He winked at me with one grey eye. \u201cNot my hometown.\u201d\nHe blew a few more notes and to my surprise I gave a little jig, feet scuffing the packed earth of the barn and raising a little cloud of dust. Up in the rafters, a mouse scampered.\n\u201cPerhaps when you have finished your chores you would come talk with me? I can play you something and you can tell me what you think.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cThat would be just fine.\u201d\nI left the platter and returned to the house. Father was already asleep, our old mouser Grizzle curled atop his chest.\n* * *\nThat evening I made my way back to the barn. Joachim had built a small fire in the yard for warmth and sat before it, the fife between his lips.\nHe smiled as I approached. Then he sent a few notes into the air, creating such a moment of elation for me that I gave a little skip and turn. Another trill and I was lightheaded, prancing dreamily over to the fire.\nHe looked pleased.\n\u201cTell me,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat comes to mind when I play this.\u201d\nHe piped, and it was as if I were slumbering amongst the roots of a riverbank tree.\nI told him.\n\u201cAnd this?\u201d\nAnother tune, and I was striding amongst the night-time clouds, able to reach my hand to the stars and pull them to me as I desired.\nI told him.\n\u201cGood.\u201d He stared into the flames, an odd smile on his face.\nGrizzle came sniffing around and I scooped her into my arms, gray as she was, and beyond mousing.\n\u201cFine old thing,\u201d said Joachim.\n\u201cYes. We need a new cat, really. There are more mice than ever around the farm these days. Rats, too.\u201d\nJoachim\u2019s eyes sparked in the firelight.\n\u201cPerhaps I can help with that.\u201d\nHe raised the fife and played a tune that was both lively and sad. It didn\u2019t move me quite as much as the melody he\u2019d played earlier, but it was still beautiful.\nAfter a moment the night came alive.\nA large brown rat ran across the yard and sat before Joachim, watching him carefully. Grizzle perked up, eyes wide, but I held her tight. Another rat came and then a half dozen mice, running together from the barn. Within a few dozen heartbeats there were scores of rodents pouring from the shadows and sitting by Joachim. It must have been every mouse and rat for a mile around.\nOnce they\u2019d stopped coming, Joachim stood and, still playing, began to parade around the yard. The rats and mice followed him, a long column of them snaking in his footsteps. He led them round in a circle twice and then cut towards the fire.\nHe cleared the blaze in one long stride and without missing a note of the beautiful tune. The rodents, either unknowing or uncaring, dove straight into the flames. One by one they emerged, wreathed in fire, shrieking and bolting for the darkness. The yard was soon covered by smouldering lumps of scorched flesh.\nGrizzle thrashed her way free from my arms and fled.\nJoachim returned to his place by the fire.\n\u201cNow you have no more rodent problems,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve repaid your family\u2019s kindness. It\u2019s very important, young Klement,\u201d and he winked again, \u201cto pay your debts.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t sleep well that night. I hoped Grizzle might come to rest against me like she sometimes did, but there was no sign of her. I consoled myself with the thought that the mendicant man would leave soon. He\u2019d paid for his room and board, after all.\n* * *\nI tried to avoid Joachim the next day, but father insisted I take him a bowl of porridge for a late breakfast. I shut my eyes against the dozens of tiny corpses still littering the yard as I crossed to the barn.\nJoachim leapt to his feet as I entered.\n\u201cI have it, thanks to you! All last night I was experimenting, composing, looking for the right combination. Every creature is different, you know?\u201d\nHe raised the fife and played the most heavenly music I\u2019ve ever heard, each note more perfect than the last. I sometimes hear it even now, faintly, its faded memory catching me at odd moments and bringing tears to my eyes.\nI don\u2019t remember what happened while he played to me that day in the barn. I know he left, and that I followed the piping, and that I danced because while the music lasted all the world was wonderful and perfect and right.\nWhen he stopped, I was on the bridge over the little stream that marked the edge of the village. Joachim was on the other side, his tattered bag across one shoulder. He gave a bow and flourished the fife.\n\u201cThank you, Klement,\u201d he called. Then he dug in his bag and tugged out a coat stitched from many bright colours and slipped it around his shoulders.\nI watched as he walked towards the mountain. I longed to hear the fife play once more, but somehow knew that if I did, I would never see my home or family again.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

I rub my arms, my thighs.\nThe swell in my breasts dies down. I do not ring Mario. I do not ring anybody. I plan a holiday. I take the train to Sicily, to my grandmother\u2019s house \u2014 boarded up, now, and vines throttle the drainpipes. I buy both seats in the first-class compartment and put my shoes up on the cushions.\nI arrive in Cefalu at dawn and sleep for twenty-one hours. I wake up at four in the morning and fold and unfold my grandmother\u2019s tablecloths; at six, when the sun rises, I start to walk.\nI take off my shoes at the beach and let the wet sand rise up between my toes. The air smells of salt and lemon-blossoms; I shake out my hair and let the wind tangle it. The sun rises over the bay and I glory in the silence. The sea is calm and the light dances on the rock.\nI see her out of the corner of my eye. She is hobbling toward me, her hair sparse on her head and luxuriant on her chin, with a toadstool mole on her nose and several more on her cheeks.\nShe grabs my wrist and holds it. \u201cNon sei freddo?\u201d\nI can smell the onions on her breath. She presses the sweat of her palms against my bare legs and smiles widely, her tongue flicking through the gaps in her teeth.\n\u201cCold?\u201d She rubs more vigorously and I cry out.\nI try to pull away, and find that a misguided prickle of politeness keeps me in place. I thank her, tell her I am fine, that I am used to the weather in Milan \u2014 I am used to Milan, I say, and savor my success.\n\u201cNo!\u201d She scowls and moved her hand to my bare feet. \u201cIs dangerous!\u201d The smell of her makes my gorge rise. \u201cIs no good for baby.\u201d\n\u201cBaby?\u201d Somewhere in my shock I find my voice. \u201cThere\u2019s no baby.\u201d\nShe shakes her head and places the palms of her hands on my stomach, letting loose a guttural belch of disapproval. \u201cLa mamma \u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry,\u201d I say, instinctively, flushing at my own spinelessness. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re wrong. And I\u2019m not cold.\u201d\nShe shrugs, with that grimly fatalistic shrug I remember from my childhood, the one that means it is up to those ancestral spirits to arbitrate upon the veracity of things, and trudges along. I have not convinced her.\nI go home and try in vain to scrub away the smell of her, the cloying garlic pungency of her, off my thighs, my wrists, both my arms. But it lingers \u2014 caught on the folds of my skirt, on my shirtsleeves. Soap cannot get it out. Bleach cannot get it out.\nMy legs are purple where she has rubbed them; my wrist is swollen where she has touched it.\nThere is no baby. I cannot stop hearing my words, ricocheting off the roof of my skull. She has mistaken me for someone else; she is senile, or maybe mad, or confused me with one of my myriad third-cousins who have never left here. I\u2019ve looked a hundred and a thousand times in the mirror\u2013 I know there are no more signs. I know that there is nothing left of that which I have exorcised from myself.\nI press my hands against my stomach as she has done. It is as flat, as firm, as it has always been.\nI feel a kick, and that is all.\nI race to explanations \u2014 it is my nerves, my fear; it is the nausea at the putrefying smell of her that has made me swallow bile and my stomach invert itself. No \u2014 I am alone, I am alone; there is nobody here with me; there is nobody here but me. My wrist, which she has bruised, is mine. My stomach which she has touched is mine. The blood that is racing faster and faster through my veins is mine. There is no one else here.\nI walk until my feet bleed to stop myself from thinking. I cannot stop, cannot slow down. I shove past vendors in the marketplace, past boys with dark eyes, past more old women. There is no space for me here, nowhere to breathe. One of the fruit-sellers elbows past me, jabbing me in the gut. I splutter and cough and apologize in dialect I did not know that I remembered, but he is gone now.\nA blast of smoke from the rotisserie smears my face with sweat. Arms press against my arms. Legs press against my legs. Men shout the names of their products \u2014 sarde, cipolli, finnocchio \u2014 in my ears. I put up my hands but I cannot block them out.\nI cannot stop the sound, nor the sweat, nor the smell. Everything is spinning; everything sickens me.\nThe vines burst out from the houses; they are mocking me. Weeds poke out from between cobblestones, from against buildings, from concrete. The rocks are slick with moss and the sea teems with rotting fish, and the smell forces itself down my nostrils. The fishmongers shove handfuls of squid into my face; their tentacles flick brine and viscera into my eyes. The chickens on the back of the jeep squawk and shove their necks out of their crates and slice themselves open. Spiders multiply in the earth between my toes. The birds shriek; the horseflies hiss. Someone gropes me in front of the butcher\u2019s stall. I cannot stand the noise.\nI turn into a blind alley, reeling. I have felt like this before.\nI cannot feel like this again.\nI tell myself that the blight is gone, that I have made myself barren there, that I have scorched the earth there lest that presence come for me again. There is no way I am carrying any child \u2014 there is no way I am carrying that child, who is gone and who was never born, whom I did not name or christen but whom I hated from the first moment it tried to claw its way out. I have wrestled with that cherub and I have won.\nI feel another kick, sharper than scalpels, and then another. It slices through me and I crumple to my knees and let my palms touch the earth.\nEverything is louder, now \u2014 louder than I can bear. This island is raging up against me, all around me, buzzing and chirping and teeming and creeping, fecund and rippling. Its women stare into my womb and see what is not there; its men feast their eyes on the carrion of my flesh and imagine what they could do to me, and what they could make me bear. My great-grandmother and her mother and the whole pruned vine are watching me, and the spiders whisper in their voice that I have robbed them of their child.\n\u201cSignora?\u201d It is a man this time, younger than I am, with hair that falls across his eyes and hands that find their way around my waist. \u201cSignora, are you all right?\u201d\nI am shaking in his arms as he lifts me. His fingers leave indentations in my flesh. His sweat seeps into me, and I have no skin to separate us.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine\u2014\u201d my voice collapses upon itself. \u201cI was feeling a little ill\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou must rest.\u201d His grip tightens; he steers me down the alley. He is commanding; he is used to this. \u201cYou must sit, please.\u201d\nI lose the urge to resist. I will do anything to get away from the smell of rotting fish, of apples that have burst open in the sun. I follow him through the crumbling alleyways, where the paint flakes and the shutters creak, and let him guide me by the waist to a small courtyard, flanked by white rows of laundry, to a bench.\n\u201cYou have worried me,\u201d he tells me. \u201cAre you sick?\u201d\nI shake my head, and pray that he will not ask the next question. \u201cDehydrated,\u201d I say, and he does not understand me. \u201cWater.\u201d\n\u201cWater.\u201d This he comprehends. \u201cCome inside.\u201d\nI follow him, still dizzy. He brings me a glass and I gulp it down, and it almost chokes me.\n\u201cYou are foreign?\u201d\nI shake my head.\n\u201cFrom here, then?\u201d\nIt takes all the effort I can muster to tell him that I live in Milan, now. I feel the desire, quick as sickness, to tell him all about it: the clean faucets, the white walls, the functional heating, the meters and meters of space, delirious in their expanse, with only me in it.\n\u201cBellissima.\u201d\nIt takes me a while to realize that his hand is still around my waist. It takes me a while to realize that he is stroking my hair. His hands reach for my hips; they grip tight enough that I cry out.\nHe tries to silence me with murmurs, blandishments, soft animal cries. He presses me to him and forces his tongue between my lips. He tastes of salt and smells of grease and his sweat disgusts me, I want more than anything to be alone, but in his arms I am not alone. I am only flesh, flesh for him to take and kiss and eat, flesh in which to spawn more like him, and then I will never be alone.\nAnother kick.\nI shove him away; I scratch him with my nails, and when he yelps I realize that I have drawn blood. He curses at me, calls me a whore, and I run.\nI cannot stop running. I wipe the blood from my hands on the laundry outside his front door; I race down the Via Veterani and vomit among the cobblestones.\nThere is a beginning and an end to things, and they remain apart; they do not devour one another. Out of death there is nothing. I tell myself that my body belongs to me, and that my skin which is bruised now with his grasp belongs to me. I tell myself that I am inviolate and inviolable, that I am alone.\nI will never be alone.\nWithin me my double plucks at my sinews; it scratches at its escape; it will claw its way out. The ancestral spirits are howling with the storm at the sea, and the witch-women in the harbor are cackling over their ointments, and they are laughing louder than the fishmongers\u2019 cries because they know that they have won.\nI run back to the marketplace. I know what I must do. I must plunge into the heat, the crowds, the sweat, the overabundance of flesh. I must go where the gulls shriek and the spiders burst out of their eggs, and let the smell of the fish and the meat and the rotting apples wash over me until I am no longer too dizzy to stand. I must go to the butcher\u2019s stall, and there I must do what those know-nothing charlatans in Milan could not do and what I am not afraid to do and seize hold of the knife they use to separate the meat from the bone.\nI will make a sacrifice to my household gods. I will pour out libations on the cobblestones. I will mop up the blood with the folds of my skirts and sing lullabies in lu siciliana. I will throw salt over my shoulder and bow to the earth, and then I will hold him in my arms.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

He nodded, pleased with the results, went to the tree, pulled out the knives, and went back to his mark.\nIt was a beautiful summer morning. In the trees, birds warbled nonsense to one another. A squirrel waited patiently for his tree back (he had a cache of nuts hidden in a hollowed out branch). Tweedledee always liked this time of year, the sun seemed to rise at just the right time as to balance light and temperature \u2014 a fleeting condition that only lasted for an unnamed season that bridged summer and spring.\nHe let the knives fly again, this time pausing a few seconds between each. When the last knife hit the wood, a voice behind him spoke.\n\u201cNice throw, \u2018Dee.\u201d\nTweedledee turned to see Tweedledum grinning oafishly; two sacks were slung over his shoulder.\n\u201cGood morning, how are you doing?\u201d Tweedledee said.\n\u201cBeen digging, digging, digging,\u201d Tweedledum said, and shook the bags with a rattle. \u201cA dead man\u2019s bones.\u201d\n\u201cWhich reminds me,\u201d Tweedledee said. \u201cHow\u2019s the love potion coming?\u201d\n\u201cJust finished last night, the final ingredient is\u2013\u201d Tweedledum looked around, and lowered his voice to a whisper, and put his face next to Tweedledee\u2019s ear: \u201cThe secret ingredient is the hearts of wild roses\u2013\u201d then even more softly, \u201c\u2013still beating.\u201d\nTweedledee stepped back with a grimace, and turned to retrieve his knives from the tree.\n\u201cAnd of course, just pinch of the ground up gizzard of a spring pullet to thicken it all up,\u201d Tweedledum said in his normal voice. \u201cWhat is the scowl for?\u201d\n\u201cOne would think that a man who claims to have touched the philosopher\u2019s stone would have discovered the mystical and ancient secret of good oral hygiene.\u201d\nTweedledum breathed into his hand and sniffed.\n\u201cYou\u2019re smelling the bones,\u201d Tweedledum said, digging in his pocket, until he produced a tiny vial of purple liquid.\n\u201cAnd yes, I have the potion,\u201d he added. \u201cBut you can\u2019t have it until you apologize.\u201d\n\u201cFor?\u201d Tweedledee said while reaching for the vial.\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong with my breath,\u201d Tweedledum said, whipping his hand back and pocketing the potion.\n\u201cInstead, my amends will be to buy you a toothbrush for our birthday,\u201d Tweedledee said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the bones, unless you\u2019ve been chewing them.\u201d\nTweedledum\u2019s cheeks and ears turned a muted crimson.\n\u201cI certainly have not been chewing them, don\u2019t be absurd.\u201d\nTweedledee let the three knives fly again, this time, to his dismay one bounced off the tree trunk and embedded itself in the dirt.\n\u201cYou missed,\u201d Tweedledum said. \u201cWho is the potion for? Not that I should have to ask, love always ends the same for the groom: hen-pecked and far too many unexpected visits from the in-laws.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s for Lady Boo-Boo, and it certainly will not end that way,\u201d Tweedledee said. \u201cSo hand it over.\u201d\n\u201cWhat will you be paying with?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d charge your own brother? Your twin brother?\u201d\n\u201cEven alchemists have to eat,\u201d Tweedledum said.\nTweedledee looked at the sack of bones, but didn\u2019t say anything.\n\u201cBad choice of words,\u201d Tweedledum said.\nTweedledee searched his pockets, and finally dug out an egg-shaped stone that fit nicely into his palm. He shook it gently next to his ear, and then carefully broke it in two, and held the halves by his fingertips. From the center of the stone, a two headed green snake rose up, tongue flickering, eyes like tiny blackberry drupelets in the creature\u2019s heads. The heads turned in opposite directions.\n\u201cThe Seeing Snake watches to the east and the west,\u201d Tweedledee said. \u201cIf an enemy approaches it hisses in warning.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if they come from the north or south?\u201d Tweedledum asked.\n\u201cYou\u2019d need another snake.\u201d\nTweedledum held out the vial, and Tweedledee carefully pushed Seeing Snake back into his stone egg and closed it tight. The exchange was made; Tweedledee held the vial up to the light.\n\u201cYou are wondering, my boorish brother, how one uses it?\u201d Tweedledum said.\nTweedledee nodded.\n\u201cOne drop on her tongue will make her blood boil in uncontrollable lust for the first man she sees.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d hardly call that a love potion, but it is an excellent substitute.\u201d\n\u201cIf it is broody you want, then two drops on her tongue will make her fall deeply and madly in love.\u201d\n\u201cAnd, what pray tell, would three drops bring?\u201d\nTweedledee laughed, shaking the bags of bones.\n\u201cOh, you wouldn\u2019t want to do that. I would say the results would be . . . undefined.\u201d\nTweedledee put the love potion away, then retrieved his knives and after cleaning a bit of dirt off the misfire, he carefully wrapped them in thin leather.\n\u201cI must be off,\u201d Tweedledum said, \u201cthese bones won\u2019t render themselves, now will they?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly not. And I, dear brother, I\u2019m off to pay a visit to the lovely Lady Boo-Boo.\u201d\nTweedledum grinned, showing suspiciously dark teeth, perhaps mussed with bits of bone and marrow.\nTweedledee strolled up the side of the Ojo Loco Mountain. The path was still muddy and damp from melting snow that had all but disappeared only last week. If he cocked his head just right, he could hear the burbling of the underground stream that ran next to the path.\nAnd even more faintly, he strongly suspected, he could hear the off-key singing of the beautiful Lady Boo-Boo. As he walked further and further up the path, it became steeper and steeper. His suspicions were confirmed, he came around pile of boulders, rounded from a slow roll down the mountain.\nShe sang:\nTweedledum and Tweedledee\nAgreed to have a battle;\nFor Tweedledum said Tweedledee\nHad spoiled his nice new rattle.\nJust then flew down a monstrous crow,\nAs black as a tar-barrel;\nWhich frightened both the heroes so,\nThey quite forgot their quarrel.\n\u201cHmmph,\u201d Tweedledee said, and followed the singing until he came around another bend. She repeated the verse with more enthusiasm than euphony. Up through a series of trees, where the path became smaller and more lightly used, up to a hidden little alcove of rocks where a hot spring filled a basin. A pink dress and a towel hung over a tree branch. Tweedledee hid behind a tree and watched as the ginger-haired Lady Boo-Boo bathed in the steaming water. Soap suds covered her most interesting parts, to Tweedledee\u2019s disappointment.\n\u201cI see you Tweedle-y-dee,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I thought you were a gentleman.\u201d\nTweedledee came out from the tree.\n\u201cWhatever gave you that impression?\u201d\nShe continued washing, careful not to flatten the suds with the hot spring water; her song nothing more than a soft hum.\n\u201cI am smitten though, and when a man is smitten he does things he normally would not do. Remember that muggy midsummer\u2019s eve? I brought you heat lightening in a crystal decanter.\u201d\n\u201cYou brought me a lightening bug in a mead jug,\u201d Lady Boo-Boo said, and slipped under the water so just her head could be seen. \u201cAnd when you promised me the stars wrapped in spider\u2019s silk, it was only sand and darning thread. Now shoo, Tweedle-y-dee.\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d Tweedledee said, not easily thwarted, \u201cI\u2019ve brought you sweet nectar of tangerine blossoms harvested by wild honeybees from the Otherwhere Underneath. Where the men walk upside down, and it snows in summer. They have man-sized jumping mice that keep their babies in a hide-pocket.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no such place, and no such thing. The world is flat as everyone knows,\u201d Lady Boo-Boo said. \u201cOver by my dress is a towel, get it please, and do stay away from my underthings.\u201d\nTweedledee pulled out the vial.\n\u201cOne drop,\u201d he said, \u201cis like eating a meadow of flowers, the gods themselves spread it on their toast.\u201d\nLady Boo-Boo rolled her eyes in her peculiar way, as if she were glancing to the earth, and then to the sky. She batted her eyelashes and made a soft clucking noise.\n\u201cOne drop on the tongue, or perhaps two,\u201d he said.\nShe stuck out her tongue, a shade lighter than a fig, but retracted it just as quickly.\n\u201cWhat if it were poison?\u201d she said.\n\u201cI\u2019d never\u2013\u201c\n\u201cWhat if it was a potion \u2026 \u201d she continued.\n\u201cCertainly not!\u201d\n\u201cWhat if it was a potion that made me sleep, and then you took advantage of my state?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m cut to the quick, Boo-Boo, I would never resort to glamour.\u201d\n\u201cOf course not.\u201d\nShe closed her eyes, leaned back, so it appeared her face floated in the steaming spring water. The faint smell of minerals wafted in the air. While she rinsed soap from her hair. Tweedledee in a gesture of good servitude fetched her towel. He dog-grinned as the pink buds of her interesting bits became almost visible amongst the burble and the bubbles.\n\u201cTurn around, and leave the towel where I can reach it. No funny business, or I\u2019ll call for my big brother.\u201d\nTweedledee dropped the towel and turned around; he could hear the splish-splash of Lady Boo-Boo exiting the hot spring.\n\u201cYour big brother is off on a fool\u2019s quest.\u201d\n\u201cHe owns seven-league boots and a silver horn that he puts on his ear. He can hear for a thousand miles. I\u2019ll bet he\u2019s listening now.\u201d\nTweedledee was silent, and listened to the soft rubbing of the towel on her skin.\n\u201cHe\u2019d be here in a second, if I yelled,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2013no looking until I\u2019m dressed. I see you turning your head, trying to peek. Cover up your eyes.\u201d\nTweedledee obliged, but he could see through his fingers that she had wrapped the towel round herself. She was short, almost ample, perhaps a little gaunt from a long winter of living off preserved meats and fruits. Somehow, she managed to get dressed without revealing anything but flash of her freckled thigh.\n\u201cTo be honest,\u201d she said as she combed her hair with a wide-tooth ivory comb, \u201cI am a bit peckish, maybe just a little taste to hold me over until I get home.\u201d\nTweedledee removed a throwing knife from the leather wrapping, polished the end clean with the leather, and poured a drop of the potion on the very tip, where it glistened. Lady Boo-Boo finished combing her hair, and wedged the comb into her thick curls, pinning them away from her eyes. She stuck out her tongue, tucked her hands under her armpits, and leaned forward. Tweedledee shook the drop off onto her tongue.\n\u201cOh my,\u201d Lady Boo-Boo said as her cheeks flushed. \u201cThere certainly is a tang to it,\u201d she continued, \u201cI do feel a bit of sudden heat.\u201d She fanned herself with her hand. \u201cA most peculiar heat, and it is so cool this time of year.\u201d\nTweedledee met her eyes, capped the potion, then folded the knife into its leather sheath.\n\u201cMy, oh my, I never noticed you are a very handsome man, Tweedle-y-dee, very handsome indeed.\u201d\nShe dropped the towel she\u2019d just folded up, and put her arms around Tweedledee\u2019s neck and gave him a big wet kiss on the lips.\nTweedledum stirred his kettle with a big wooden stick. The noxious brew of bones and liquid boiled, dark as tar. He whistled while he worked, stopping only once to lick a splatter off his knuckle. Behind him, two identical cabins stood, covered in kudzu like vines. Tweedledee came up through the forest path, limping slightly.\n\u201cWould you, dear brother, happen to have a cunning salve?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever for?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cChaffing down below, if you catch my meaning,\u201d Tweedledee said.\n\u201cSo the potion worked then?\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Worked\u2019 would be an understatement.\u201d\n\u201cHold your ground, and I will return,\u201d Tweedledum said, set his stirring paddle on the side of the pot, and went into the door of his cabin. He came back only minutes later with a little round tin with a lid. He handed it to Tweedledee.\n\u201cOh \u2018Deeeeeeee!\u201d\nLady Boo-Boo\u2019s voice carried across the air from somewhere between the trees.\n\u201cOh, I really must apply this salve,\u201d Tweedledee said. \u201cKeep Lady Boo-Boo company, just for a minute?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d Tweedledum said with a chuckle and an unnaturally suggestive wag of his eyebrows. Tweedledee opened the door to his cabin, slammed it, then loudly bolted it. Only seconds later Lady Boo-Boo broke through the trees.\n\u201cTweedley-y-dee, oh there you are. That was a dirty trick, but I forgive you.\u201d\nShe brought herself close enough to put her arms up around Tweedledum\u2019s neck.\n\u201cSomething strange, I think \u2026 \u201d she said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t help but forgive you \u2026 something very strange.\u201d\n\u201cWhat dirty trick? What manner of dirty?\u201d Tweedledum wagged his eyebrows again.\n\u201cThe first taste of the honey brought a fever to my blood.\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d\n\u201cBut now, after the second taste\u2014\u201c\n\u201cThe second taste?\u201d\n\u201c\u2013you said to me, \u2018Lady Boo-Boo, close your eyes and stick out your tongue and I will give you a surprise, don\u2019t open them until I tell you.\u2019, naturally I thought it might be something a little more substantial due to our . . . well, you know, our recent understanding, but it was just another taste of that honey. Then I waited and waited for you say \u2018Open your eyes Lady Boo-Boo.\u2019 but you never did, and when I finally looked, you were gone. But I found you now. And that fever has passed\u2013I just feel\u2013oh do you want children? I\u2019d like less than fifteen, my mother had twenty, but I felt that was a little much.\u201d\n\u201cI am Tweedledum. Tweedledum! You are looking for Tweedledee. He\u2019s in there,\u201d Tweedledum used his thumb to point over his shoulder. Then pulled down his shirt to show a tattoo just over his left breast. \u2018Dum\u2019 it said in baroque runes.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Lady Boo-Boo said and wrinkled up her nose. \u201cAll the better really. Tweedledee and I, we had our fun, but now, I\u2019m really ready for something a little more \u2026 stable.\u201d\nTweedledum gently took Lady Boo-Boo\u2019s arms off his neck; he was certain he could hear Tweedledee snickering from behind the door of his cabin.\n\u201cBut \u2026 but,\u201d Tweedledum said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really settled,\u201d Lady Boo-Boo said. \u201cI\u2019ll start looking for a new dress this very day.\u201d\n\u201cDress?\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t be getting married in this old thing. We\u2019ll need rings. I don\u2019t mind a simple gold band for you, but I really must insist on diamonds in mine.\u201d\n\u201cMarriage?!\u201d howled Tweedledum \u2014 more snickering from Tweedledee\u2019s cabin. \u201cBut \u2014 but\u2013\u201c\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to brush those teeth. What do bachelors eat? Don\u2019t answer that, home cooked meals from now on. Mainly vegetarian is best, meat on special occasions only.\u201d\n\u201cVegetarian?\u201d\nTweedledum followed the instinct of many a man before him.\n\u201cLook!\u201d he said, and pointed to the woods, \u201cWhat it the world is that?\u201d And when Lady Boo-Boo turned to look, he ran off to his cabin, shut the door very quickly and engaged the lock.\nInside the house Tweedledum, pulled up a rug, took hold of the ring to his cellar door and pulled it up.\nBelow, lit by foxfire, and glowing mushrooms that sprouted from the walls, were racks of wine, wheels of cheese and cobwebbed covered canning jars of Tweedledum\u2019s special preserves, but none of this was what he was interested in.\nHe could easily stand once he was inside, and he made his way past the shelves into the long hallway that joined Tweedledee\u2019s cellar. Minutes later he popped his head up into Tweedledee\u2019s house.\nTweedledee was bent over, peeping through a crack in the log walls, and without a word Tweedledum joined him. Outside Lady Boo-Boo was knocking on Tweedledum\u2019s door with her little fist, not much bigger than an apple, and almost as red.\n\u201cAnother fine mess you\u2019ve gotten us into,\u201d Tweedledee said.\n\u201cWhat? ME?\u201d\n\u201cYou made the potion.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but, you gave it to her \u2026 twice.\u201d\nThrough the chink they saw Lady Boo-Boo abandon her efforts on Tweedledum\u2019s door and came to Tweedledee\u2019s and started pounding.\n\u201cOpen up in there!\u201d she yelled. \u201cI know you\u2019re in there.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll split the difference,\u201d Tweedledee said, \u201cWe\u2019ll both marry her, I\u2019ll support her wifely needs in the bedroom, and you, of course, can support the children.\u201d\nTweedledum pinched his brother on the arm; Tweedledee yelped like dog. They both stood, Tweedledee rubbing his arm, Tweedledum scowling.\n\u201cOnly one thing to do,\u201d Tweedledum said, after a wrinkled forehead, and several seconds of thought.\n\u201cRun away to Otherwhere Underneath? Become sailors?\u201d\n\u201cA third drop,\u201d Tweedledum said.\n\u201cYou said the results would be undefined,\u201d Tweedledee said.\n\u201cThey are, but could it get any worse?\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, I\u2019m not sure how, but I think it could.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m calling for my big brother!\u201d Lady Boo-Boo yelled, and then howled out her brother\u2019s name.\n\u201cLet her in,\u201d Tweedledum said. \u201cWe\u2019ll give her the last drop.\u201d\nTweedledee groaned and opened up the door.\n\u201cLady Boo-Boo,\u201d he said with a bow, \u201cwelcome to my simple home.\u201d\nShe pushed by him with a snort.\n\u201cYou had your chance, Tweedle-y-dee. Now Tweedle-y-dum, why did you run away?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2013I \u2026 was looking for a present for you!\u201d\n\u201cOh? I should hope so, my big brother is coming, seven leagues in each step.\u201d\nHe searched his pockets, found the Seeing Snake in his egg-shaped rock.\n\u201cYes, yes \u2014 Tweedledee, dear brother, where ever are you going?\u201d Tweedledum said.\nTweedledee stopped as he was slipping out the door; his grin collapsing from clever to something almost equine.\n\u201cChecking on your rendering pot \u2026 \u201c\n\u201c\u2013you see,\u201d Tweedledum said, opening the egg to reveal the two-headed snake. It rose up and started hissing and striking at Lady Boo-Boo, \u201cYou see, it\u2019s a, umm, a magic snake, it finds the most beautiful woman in the world, it and, umm, of courses hisses, and tries to bite her.\u201d\nTweedledum handed it to her, and she held it in her palm for a moment watched it, a dissatisfied sneer hanging on the corner of her mouth.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it, it smells of a slue,\u201d she said finally, and handed it back.\n\u201cPerhaps you\u2019d like another taste of nectar then?\u201d Tweedledee said, unconvincingly.\nShe wrinkled her nose.\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this time I\u2019m going to keep my eyes open.\u201d\nTweedledum tried to get Seeing Snake back in the egg as Tweedledee trembled ever so slightly as he put the third drop of the potion on the tip of his knife.\n\u201cHere you go then,\u201d he said, and held it out, the purple droplet seemed to hang on the tip forever, and Lady Boo-Boo\u2019s little fig colored tongue was poking out . . . the drop seemed to fall for an eternity, and finally it met her tongue and was absorbed. She smacked her lips.\nTweedledum still fumbled with the Seeing Snake, it was now crawling up his arm, slithering up around his shoulders.\n\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Tweedledee asked.\nShe considered, \u201cI feel, I feel\u2013\u201d she hiccuped, and then belched in a most unladylike baritone. \u201cI feel\u2013\u201c\n\u201cYes?\u201d Tweedledee and Tweedledum said in a hopeful unison.\nTweedledee was now trying to catch the Seeing Snake in his cupped hands as it slithered down Tweedledum\u2019s back, but it moved too quickly and in a moment of panic flung itself to the floor.\n\u201cI feel like\u2013\u201c\nHer flesh seemed to be twisting and writhing on bones as she shrunk. The soft bits of flesh became leather, and then finally separated into delicate feathery constructs as she became smaller and smaller. Her pink dress went up in a puff of sparkles and dust. Finally, after some amazing contortions, she stood, not a foot off the ground.\nThe Seeing Snake rose up on its tail and hissed, one head staring at the hen, the other out the front door.\nThe hen looked up to the brothers, scolding them with a natter of clucks and cackles.\nOutside a man bounded into the clearing, landing quite close to the pot of stewing bones. He knelt and pulled tight the laces of his boots.\n\u201cSister Boo-Boo!\u201d he bellowed.\nThe hen continued her chiding, but now made her way to where the Seeing Snake stood. She scratched at the floor, pecked one of the snakes heads, then the other, beating it down, gruesomely tearing the raw pink flesh.\n\u201cBy all that is dear,\u201d Tweedledee said, as the hen pecked again this time taking away one head\u2019s eye, then grabbed the snake by the end of the tail, tossed it up into the air and choked it down. She voiced a satisfied cluck, cluck, cluck, cluckawwwk!\nThe brothers stood eyes wide, aghast. All that remained of Seeing Snake was a smear of blood and a few scales, which the hen finished off with a bob of her head.\n\u201cWhat did I say?\u201d Tweedledum said calmly. \u201cThat\u2019s how it always ends, now isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cNo time for I told you so, her brother will be asking a lot of uncomfortable questions, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n\u201cThen we\u2019ll distract him with our hospitably, and have him stay for supper.\u201d\nThe man sniffed the pot of boiling bones, then swept the area with his eyes, finally he saw Tweedledee and Tweedledum. The hen flapped her wings and looked to brothers, and then to the man approaching.\n\u201cAnd what will we serve? Bones and fat from your pot? I won\u2019t even eat that.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tweedledum said, \u201cI was thinking of a chicken dinner.\u201d\nThe hen scratched at the floor, looked at them with bright eyes, and scolded them for the very idea.\nBosley Gravel, eclectic hack writer, was born in the Midwest, and came of age in Texas and southern New Mexico.

It is 5:30 a.m., and the baker below her apartment is right on time.\nOutside the sky is still dark. The birds are only beginning to stir, their chirps like church murmurs before service.\nShe stretches in bed, cozy under the soft cotton cover, and is grateful for all that she has had in her life. This is the first part of her practice, giving thanks. She may no longer eat regular bread, gluten being a thing of the past. But she may still rejoice in its warm, homey scent. She may still picture the baker, a tall, curly-haired man with a quick smile and muscles that move under his gray t-shirts like stealthy creatures under a calm silvery sea. She imagines what it must feel like to touch their sleek shapes, to feel his sculpted skin against hers.\nIf my face were a slice of bread, she mused, would he touch it? Might he eat it? If I were to die tomorrow, might I choose that way to go, in his hands?\nShe lets her own hands drift down, across her breasts and linger, then travel below, as she imagines his mouth on her.\nImagines the dark shadows on the hospital x-rays, the icy metal of the table, the sharp surgical blades that she has rejected.\nShe shivers, pulls herself deeper into her ivory cocoon, and hears her stomach growling in protest.\nShe is hungry. This almost never happens these days.\nLinnet slips one foot out of bed and winces as it hits the cold wooden floor. She slides out of bed and moves to the stairs, wrapping her arms tight against her sides, fighting a wave of dizziness as she climbs down the stairs, and moves towards the front door, picking up speed as she stops only long enough to grab a robe.\nToday, she will eat bread. Gluten be damned.\nDown at the bakery, the front door should be locked. It should not open for another thirty minutes, and yet it does, and the blast of warm, yeasty air envelopes her like a lover\u2019s embrace. A bell tinkles as it shuts behind her. She hears jazz playing in the kitchen. And she hears him, Rafael \u2014 the baker \u2014 singing.\nRafael pushes open the swinging door with his hip, delivering pans of cooling sticky buns to the counter and startles when he sees her there.\n\u201cOh!\u201d He says, his eyes running down her robed form, before placing the tray on the counter. She notices his arms, taut from pounding the dough and holding the trays.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that we are not open yet,\u201d he says, just as she backs away.\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019ll come back.\u201d\n\u201cNo \u2014 espera!\u201d\nHe gestures to sit, and grabs a plate, putting a hot bun in front of her. Mouth-watering cinnamon and sugar notes waft up, tickling her nose.\nRafael grins. \u201cEnjoy, on the house. Let me put coffee on. We can eat together while we wait for the bread. It\u2019s a multigrain today, you will like it.\u201d\nLinnet becomes aware that her mouth is hanging open. She closes it, then opens it again.\n\u201cHow did you know I was here for bread?\u201d\nHe smiles again, and a dimple appears in the stubble of his left jaw. His teeth are very white. \u201cThat\u2019s what people always come for, this early.\u201d\nLinnet is eating her first bite of the bun when something changes. The coffee has transformed the air, which smells and tastes like caramel. The sweet, sticky dough, so long denied her, is melting in her mouth like magic, she can taste the colors \u2014 gold and chocolate and cinnabar \u2014 like delicious medicine, and she feels that there is no need for the surgery, that she has been cured, and if only she had tried this earlier. If only her mother, and her aunt and her grandmother, and her great grandmother before her, if only they had all tried this bakery, they would all live forever, and life would be good again, and cancer research would not be needed. If only.\nShe is eating the bun, and then, suddenly, she is the bun. She is being hefted up in his strong hands and tossed onto the counter, and rubbed this way and that across the breadth of it, her body flattened and shaped into something luscious \u2014 croissants, perhaps? More sticky buns? And she is all of the ingredients \u2014 not only flour but also sugar and butter and cinnamon and she is in his mouth and in the air and in the sky and it feels so good and with a burst of flavor \u2014 like an exploding firework \u2014 she is free.\nA few minutes later Rafael smiles, sated, as he finishes his morning prep, the last buns have gone into the oven, and he is sprinkled with flour and exhausted, but in a good way. He sings as he cleans the counter, a healing song, of love and loss and rebirth during a time of sickness and poverty, a song that his mam\u00e1 sang to him, and his abuelita sang to her, and her abuela to them before that, and he misses them all fiercely, but he is at peace.\nOutside, the sky is painted with hues of rose and peach and lilac and the birds are singing happy notes that rise higher and higher, along with the passage of the sun.\nOne tiny finch flutters in front of the bakery, nabbing crumbs, before soaring off with the rest of its flock. A breeze carries a glittering dust in the air, but whether it comes from the baker\u2019s open window, or whether it begins there, in the street, no one knows.\nAnd that is enough.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

She\u2019s been looking back at it for the last few days, wondering if she should even dare touch it.\nShe ignores the urge and sets the timer on the oven; best to not burn down the house. The last time she forgot something in the oven, Jeff had been out mowing the lawn. He burst inside yelling that he could smell the burning from across the yard. How in the world could he sniff it from so far away, over the smell of the wet grass clippings, with the ear protection on and over the deafening noise of the lawn mower? They say your sense of smell diminishes when you can\u2019t hear. She heard that in a podcast.\nBut the Hound doesn\u2019t miss anything. The Hound is what the guys in his Afghanistan unit used to call him. That\u2019s because when he was working as a pilot at Creech, nobody could fart fifty yards away without him knowing it.\nThose days are long gone though. Now he\u2019s on disability until he can get a contract job and head back out somewhere to the Middle East.\nShe was down in the hot tub and didn\u2019t smell or hear anything. She had stuck the blueberry crisp in the oven and gone down for a soak. The sun had come out and she was relaxing with the jets at full blast when she saw Jeff run towards the house. She missed the sun, the only good memory she has of Nevada now that they moved to a much colder and rainier part of the country to help him switch gears. She couldn\u2019t hear anything with the jets on but she saw him wave at her, his lips opening wide to yell her name.\n\u201cBuy me a new oven then,\u201d Melissa said later when they argued, before he drove out to the supermarket to buy dessert. \u201cThe timer on this piece of crap is broken,\u201d she had said as she smashed the glass baking dish into the extra-large cast iron kitchen sink.\n\u201cYou bitch, set your damn phone,\u201d he had said.\nThe two kids were woken up by all the yelling. They spent the evening clingy and cranky, the baby crying most of the time while Melissa was trying to have a conversation with their guests, and the toddler throwing fits \u2014 he spilled a tall glass of root beer on the white linen skirt of one of the ladies, the wife of a contractor Jeff worked with side-by-side on his last Afghan tour.\nLate that night Jeff apologized for calling her a bitch and they tried to have sex. That was a couple of months ago.\nNow, the yard is decorated by piles of leaves on each side of the patio, symmetrically arranged. Jeff woke her up early in the morning with the leaf blower\u2014 must have woken up the whole neighborhood. Then he went to the city to meet with a company manager who may look past his mental health history and give him a job. This time it would be in Iraq.\nHe\u2019s definitely changed. In the past he would have cleaned up the piles right away.\nShe sets the timer on the phone. Forty minutes. It\u2019s the meat loaf recipe that he likes. The meeting must have gone well because she hasn\u2019t heard from him yet.\nShe looks up at the drone again. Would he get mad if she touched it?\nJeff never used to have gadgets like this, but now that he\u2019s unemployed and home all day he often browses online stores for hours, buying all kinds of things. He must have paid at least a grand for the drone.\nHis shrink, who is the head of the VA Medical Center in the city and a close friend of Melissa\u2019s family, said it was a good idea for Jeff to connect to his past through an object that was innocent and harmless, and yet could serve as an anchor to some of those traumatic memories. He said that Jeff mentioned that in his cockpit at the Nevada desert all he could hear was the low rumble of the air conditioning, but when he retired and started working as a private security contractor in Kandahar, he heard the constant buzzing of the drones landing and taking off, and the memories started to get the better of him.\nJeff never talked to Melissa about it, but the doctor disclosed to her that the image that most haunted Jeff was one of a little boy he saw on the screen running towards the house a second before an attack.\nShe never questioned why the doctor disclosed this information to her, but she did ask him what he thought of what Jeff had done. The doctor said that Jeff was just following orders and that somebody had to do it.\n\u201cIt takes a lot of courage to do this kind of work because so many who will benefit from it will still condemn you for it,\u201d he said, while he walked behind Melissa to the door, at a distance that allowed him to take a full look at her from behind.\nShe never asked Jeff anything because he doesn\u2019t like talking about it. The only time she heard him address it, he was pretty drunk, joking around with his buddies. He referred to the \u201csilent movies\u201d at work, with the soon-to-be \u201ccrispy critters\u201d moving around on his screen eight thousand miles away.\nSilent movies? They must be images in black and white with no sound, she thought at the time, until she went on YouTube and discovered a whole drone-porn genre of movies to watch. She didn\u2019t wonder anymore after that.\nBefore Jeff left for his interview, he played with the boys. The oldest showed him a paper airplane Melissa had helped him build the day before. He flew it right at his dad\u2019s forehead. Jeff laughed. The baby crawled towards him and held on to his shoe. Jeff picked him up and kissed him, then gave Melissa a peck and took off.\nShe gets a text from him that the meeting went great and he will likely be flying out before Christmas. Iraq and then Afghanistan. Light-duty training and consulting, easy stuff.\n\u201cMoney\u2019s gonna start flowing again,\u201d he writes.\n\u201cA new range perhaps,\u201d she shoots back.\n\u201cAnything you want, babe,\u201d he replies.\nShe pictures Christmas Eve with just the kids and her parents, and thinks that\u2019s not too bad.\nHe\u2019ll be home in less than an hour, just enough time for the meat loaf to cool down. The kids have plenty of time left on their show for her to step out into the yard and try it. With the youngest in the auto \u201crock and play\u201d three-position baby sleeper and the oldest glued to the HDTV screen, she\u2019ll buy herself enough time. She makes up her mind and gets on a stool. She reaches for the thing and the remote control that\u2019s tucked behind it.\nThe drone is lighter than she thought.\nShe steps out into the yard. The piles of leaves are starting to drift. She can smell autumn coming out of the decaying leaves.\nShe sets the drone on the lawn and turns on the remote control. She pushes a button in the joystick and the propellers begin spinning rapidly.\nThe drone buzzes like a giant wasp. She moves the joystick and it takes off. She makes it hover over one of the piles of leaves and the lawn turns brown. She makes the drone soar higher, and higher again.\nThe buzzing turns into a loud roar as a hatch opens up on the bottom of the plane, and a small cylindrical object shoots out of it.\nShe\u2019s seen those missile-like shapes on YouTube: a standard laser-guided bomb, powerful enough to wipe out their entire property as well as the neighbor\u2019s.\nThe world becomes a movie in slow motion as she sees her oldest boy coming out of the house.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that noise, mommy,\u201d he must be shouting.\nShe can\u2019t hear him because the roar of the drone is louder than anything she\u2019s ever heard before. She can\u2019t smell the autumn either \u2014 the sounds are too loud for her to smell anything. The baby must still be inside in his \u201crock and play\u201d in front of the TV. She wonders if Jeff will think she forgot something in the oven again.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Her clever hands knitted a run of bright red yarn. The needles clicked together \u2014 clip-click-clip \u2014 a sound that always reminded Eugenia of a new scissors snipping.\n\u201cOf course there is the practical side of that,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cOh, I suppose you could have found a man to do what needed to be done. I certainly wouldn\u2019t put up with that sort of business.\u201d\nEugenia, instead of looking through the window, looked right at it. Her reflection stared back at her.\n\u201cNothing but wrinkles, that\u2019s what I am. Could a person be one big wrinkle, do you suppose?\u201d\n\u201cYou are lovely, you\u2019ve aged very well.\u201d\n\u201cLike a wheel of cheese?\u201d\n\u201cMore like a bottle of burgundy wine.\u201d\nShe did look good, Eugenia decided. There was a certain surety in the corner of her eyes that made the wrinkles blend right in, and despite the loss of several teeth, her smile was still warm and pleasant.\nRuth put her knitting down.\n\u201cI can\u2019t say the thought has never crossed my mind. With our reputation it would have been quite impossible. Perhaps not these days, but then, when we were young. In those days they would have said we wanted a child for roasting and eating.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what witches do,\u201d Eugenia said, and gave a long look to the corner where the children had ridden by on their bikes only minutes before.\n\u201cThe ones in fairy tales,\u201d Ruth said, her hands clicked the needles together. \u201cBut not all, of course.\u201d\n\u201cCould a witch conjure a child, do you suppose? If I was a real witch, that\u2019s what I\u2019d do.\u201d\nRuth only nodded and knitted and knitted and nodded. Eugenia could see the faintest twinkle in Ruth\u2019s eye, just a little hint of mischief, and that made the wrinkles around the corners of Eugenia\u2019s mouth crinkle up in her pleasant little grin.\nNow there was the odd thing about Eugenia and Ruth\u2019s relationship \u2014 it was plain fact that they loved each other in ways that made them a stand out among the crowd.\nBut this was not the odd thing.\nThe odd thing was that Eugenia knew Ruth was a real witch, and Ruth knew that Eugenia knew she was a real witch \u2026 and they never spoke frankly on the topic, not once in forty-five years.\nNot when both they were beautiful slinky women with long thick hair, and all their bits that should be firm and perky were firm and perky.\nNot when they were middle aged, and things drooped just a bit.\nNot even in their silver years when their hair turned to strands of rich ivory.\nNot even when the magical pots in their bellies stopped making magic, and they both grew an odd whisker or two on their chins.\nThey had always coyly skirted around the odd thing with vague language and the most round about way one could imagine.\nHowever, there was no mistaking the bad luck that might fall upon one of Ruth\u2019s enemies.\nFor example, there was the policeman who once followed them during an evening walk through the park as Ruth and Eugenia held hands.\nHe\u2019d made lewd comments and impolitely suggested things that should not have been suggested.\nRuth only mumbled a secret syllable or two, shook her finger at the policemen as he leaned against a tree twirling his billy club and seconds later he was slapping at hornets, and running for the nearby pond.\n\u201cClearly,\u201d Ruth had said later, \u201che wasn\u2019t looking where he put his hands and stuck them exactly where they weren\u2019t wanted.\u201d\nRuth loved Eugenia very much and she knew their secret language \u2014 there was no mistake that when Eugenia asked about conjuring, she was really asking Ruth for a very unusual present.\nEugenia slept heavy, she always had, but when she snored it was quiet lady like and Ruth was forgiving of the noise.\nRuth got out of the warm covers, put her slippers on, and shuffled across the hall as she yawned and scratched. It was close to midnight \u2014 certainly no other time would do for conjuring.\nShe went down the stairs, and found her knitting bag.\nFull of yarn \u2014 purple yarn and gray yarn, perfect for making sock or scarves. Orange and brown yarn, perfect for autumn sweaters.\nRuth wasn\u2019t looking for any of these though, she was looking for the magic yarn \u2014 stuff spun from spring clouds, carnival cotton candy, spider silks, cat whiskers, the croaks of frogs, and squeaks of blind mice.\nShe hooked the magic yarn around her old knuckles and wove her fingers back and forth as she created a series of runes and symbols \u2014 Jack-in-the-Pulpit as it is sometimes called.\nShe rarely conjured things of the Gone these days, but tonight she would have to, if she was to gift Eugenia with a special present. In particular there was an imp she knew would happily sneak out into the night and steal an unwanted child for Eugenia.\nBecause as sad as it was to think, there were plenty children out there that were not truly wanted.\nSo she continued with her hands as clever and quick as a little monkey.\nFinally, the magic in the yarn was evident. It pulsed in a cold blue fire; it dripped bits of cold flame, and up through the hole created into the Gone, a fiendish shape rose up \u2014 all shadows and gnashing teeth, slobbering and ectoplasm.\nGoat horns ran in tight little spirals around its head, and it sprung up like a jack-in-the-box bouncing, bouncing, bouncing.\n\u201cHello Rutheeeee,\u201d it said with a snarl and made an uncouth snap at Ruth\u2019s nose.\nRuth said, \u201cTintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl, behave!\u201d\nAnd, of course, that was the little devil\u2019s name, and he shrunk back and hissed, \u201cOld hag, ugly old witch, what do you want of Tintamarre-bedlam-brawl-pother-and-ruckus? To eat up another noisy doggy, long time no good meat for Ruckus-Tintamarre-pother-bedlam-and-brawl.\u201d\n(He tried very hard to confuse her about his true name, by mixing it all up as often as he could.)\n\u201cWatch those wicked lips or I\u2019ll darn them up,\u201d she said.\nThe little devil snickered and gnashed his teeth, which were not really sharp, but more like soggy old roots that had gotten weathered from being above the dirt.\n\u201cUgly hag,\u201d he whispered, and then brightly: \u201cI\u2019ll wager you\u2019re still very pretty, pretty on the inside, though.\u201d He swayed just a bit, leaned over, with one long fingernail pointing out, \u201cWhat does Rutheeee want?\u201d\nIt is an unfortunate fact that as witches grow older, they grow a bit weaker and slower, and exactly the opposite is true with demons and devils.\nWhen Ruth had last seen Tintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl, he\u2019d been nothing more than what a polliwog is to a frog. That is to say, he was young, inexperienced, and quite a primitive, stupid thing.\nHe had been all too happy to roam the mortal world for a night in exchange for eating up an obnoxious dog that lived next door. A dog that had howled incessantly, and ceaselessly chased Eugenia\u2019s favorite cat.\nBut Tintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl had been conjured many time since by young and strong witches, and he\u2019d learned much more than Ruth expected.\n\u201cTintamarre-pother-and-brawl \u2014\u201d Ruth said.\nSuddenly she felt a bit nervous as the yarn tightened around her fingers.\nShe pulled and twisted, and managed to keep the knots under control, \u201c\u2014bedlam-ruckus \u2014 I want you to \u2014\u2014\u201d, but Tintamarre-bedlam-ruckus-pother-and-brawl didn\u2019t really care what she wanted, not one iota.\nThe magic yarn tightened around Ruth\u2019s fingers; her old wrists were became tired; her arthritis was quite painful, especially so late at night \u2026 and then there was a grumbling of secrets, spells, and runes from Tintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl\u2019s gnashing teeth, and more tightening of the magic string \u2014\nUpstairs, Eugenia slept soundly, but she was dreaming of Ruth in her chair where she liked to knit.\nShe dreamed that Ruth was knitting them a little child out of bits and pieces of yarn she had pulled from somewhere distant and mysterious.\nHer knitting needles were moving so fast sparks flew, and the clicks sounded how a metal spider might sound if it were to crawl up a metal web.\nBut, then in her dream, there was a terrible, horrible scream.\nEugenia sat up in bed and reached for Ruth to comfort her. All she could find was Ruth\u2019s pillow, cold and smooth.\nAnd then, as horrible as the scream was, it was even more horrible when it was cut short by a mad cackle of demonic laughter.\nEugenia\u2019s heart thumped in her chest as she put on her glasses and found her slippers. It was so quiet in the house she thought she surely dreamed the noise.\nShe went down the hall where the moonlight cast blue shadows on the floor. Down the creaky stairs \u2026 Her hand trembled as she held the banister.\n\u201cRuth!\u201d she said. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d\nNo reply.\nEugenia\u2019s stomach felt all watery, and she was sure that if she saw so much as a mouse stealing a crust of bread she would run straight back up stairs.\nEvery bit of her was terrified, and every bit of her wanted to go back to bed and put the blanket over her head.\n\u201cRuth?\u201d she whispered as she came into the room they\u2019d been sitting in the afternoon.\nShe saw Ruth\u2019s knitting bag was turned on its side. And coming out from the bag, among the common yarns, was the magic yarn, glowing blue with dazzling cold fire.\nVery faintly, coming from the bag, she could hear the last faded cry for help like a bit of wood whittled down to nothing.\nRuth\u2019s voice disappeared into the Gone, and the string started slipping away, then disappeared into the knitting bag \u2026 and without giving it another thought, Eugenia took hold of the string and went with it.\nEugenia held her breath, because she was sure if she exhaled she would certainly lose control of her bladder. This was a practical worry, even a badly timed sneeze could do that these days, much less when she was being unexpectedly pulled through a long and dark tunnel on the end of a piece of magic yarn.\nShe didn\u2019t have more than a few minutes to reflect on the situation before she was plopped down right in the middle of the Gone.\nThe magic yarn had slithered from her grasp, and now laid itself down on the ground and had melted into a long path.\nOne would think that the domain of devils and demons would be a dark and terrifying place, but this is not quite the case. It is an odd place to be sure. Devils and demons can only mimic what they have seen. But their perceptions are imperfect, and they make mistakes.\nFor example, Eugenia looked up to see a bright green sun shining down, a white sky and blue clouds that seemed to be made of bumpy stone instead of soft wisps of fog.\nShe was surrounded by a peculiar forest where the trees had branches and leaves made of ice, and fruits made of fire.\nIt was really not so terrible, she thought as she stood up and looked down the path the yarn had become.\nShe squinted to see where it went, and then listened, hoping to hear Ruth.\nBut all she heard and saw was the scratches and clucks of Hen-Who-Runs-Backwards as she ran down the path.\nHen-Who-Runs-Backwards was a fine looking black hen who was completely unsurprising, except for fact she was running backwards.\nTo the hen\u2019s credit, she did so with much grace.\nEugenia watched Hen-Who-Runs-Backwards run by \u2014\n\u201cBacon and eggs, bacon and eggs! That\u2019s what Tintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl likes!\u201d the hen clucked and continued on.\nEugenia wondered what that meant, and what a Tintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl was.\nShe stood, watched the road for a moment, and it seemed she was alone. There was some doubt in her mind now, that maybe she shouldn\u2019t have just grabbed that yarn without thinking about it. Instead she should have ran right back up stairs and hid under the blankets.\nBut then she thought of Ruth and how Ruth would always save her the soft center of a warm cinnamon bun when they shared one at the coffee shop. That was Eugenia\u2019s favorite part, but she knew Ruth liked it just as much as she did.\nShe thought for a moment, and was ashamed to realize she couldn\u2019t even remember the last time she\u2019d offered it to Ruth.\nThen she thought about how Ruth tried very hard to keep her temper when Eugenia would let her eyes get the best of her and she would spend a large sum of money on a new pair of shoes.\nAnd she thought about when they had taken a cruise around the coast of Mexico. They had stopped at a port and watched a candymaker mix chocolate.\nHe added just a pinch of red chili; he explained it was to make the chocolate taste richer and more full, and Ruth had said, \u201cThat\u2019s what you are Eugenia, you are the little pinch of red chili in my life.\u201d\nShe had a great many of these kinds of thoughts, and so instead of just looking down the road, she said \u201cRUTH! Where are you?!\u201d, waited for a reply, and when she didn\u2019t hear anything she started walking.\nTintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl lived in a silly little house made of moldy leaves and mud, right next to a bog, which was about the same thing as house except a lot wetter.\nInside his home, there was just about enough space for him and a witch named Ruth.\nIt should go without saying that Ruth was quite unhappy with the situation she now found herself in.\nTintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl had taken her magic yarn and bound her two big toes together, then twisted it up all around her feet, up around her ankles, then her knees, up to her thighs, then around her soft belly, and right up over her little old lady boobies and right up to her armpits.\nThis left her arms completely free.\nThen the yarn was wrapped right up around her neck, and then right up over her mouth, and continued on up around her head and left her nose, ears and eyes uncovered.\nNone of this was pleasant, to be sure, but Tintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl had also hung her upside down on a hook from the ceiling. It was all very uncomfortable.\nTo make matters even worse Tintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl had forced her to knit the most horrid strings of slimy goo together. A goo that he seemed to have an endless supply of.\nFirst he\u2019d asked for a little slime hat that he could wear, but seeing what true artisan she was, he thought she might just make him a scarf as well.\nOnce she was done with that, he needed a new slime sweater, and that was what she was knitting now.\n\u201cPants!\u201d Tintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl screeched, \u201cMooooore muculent, Rutheeee! Mooorre muculant!\u201d\nRuth was getting tired, and her hands ached.\nThe only knitting needles Tintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl had were made out of rough slivers of bone and they were giving her blisters and her arthritis was burning in her knuckles and her wrists.\n\u201cPleeasssse!\u201d she begged, \u201cTintamarre-bedlam-pother-brawl-and-ruckus, behave!\u201d But it didn\u2019t work anymore because she had gotten so flustered she couldn\u2019t remember the right order.\nTintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl just cackled and picked at his turned up snout with a long fingernail, and found a bit more slime for Ruth to knit with.\nWhen Eugenia was afraid she liked to hum, so she was humming like a hive full of bumblebees.\nShe walked down the road, and it wasn\u2019t long before along Pig-on-his-Hind-Legs came running by. Just as you might expect from his name, he ran on hind legs.\nHe didn\u2019t even give Eugenia a second glance, instead he oinked twice, and said, \u201cEggs and bacon, eggs and bacon! That\u2019s what Tintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl likes!\u201d\nOnly seconds later the pig was gone and Eugenia thought to herself that she should try to remember what the pig said, because it sounded a lot like what the hen said. And certainly it was worth remembering if it was said so often.\nSo she stopped humming and began muttering under her breath, \u201cTintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl likes bacon and eggs. That\u2019s what he likes. Or was that bacon and eggs that liked Tintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl or was that brawl-and-pother, or pother-and-ruckus?\u201d\nShe walked until her little old feet were sore, and her little old ankles felt like little wooden splinters were being driven into them.\nWhen she got too tired, she stopped and rested, and when she got thirsty she pulled an ice leaf off a tree and let it melt on her tongue.\nWhen she got hungry, she tried one of the fire fruits that were actually cold fire \u2014 so she could pick them and hold them without any trouble.\nShe suspected it would be far too spicy for her, but it wasn\u2019t, it was just right.\nAnd after she was refreshed she moved on.\nFinally, she came up on a little mud house, with a little bit of smoke coming out of the chimney, and a little stinky bog right next to it. She hid behind a tree, her knees trembled as she tried to muster her courage.\nIt didn\u2019t seem to muster like she\u2019d hoped so she waited a bit \u2026\n\u2026 it wasn\u2019t long before she saw the owner of the house, which was of course, Tintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl.\nHe came out dressed from head to toe in a brand new slime suit. He was in a more foul mood than earlier, because even in the Gone every demon has a day job he must attend.\nTintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl\u2019s job was to pop into the mortal world and whisper things into children\u2019s ears.\nThis wasn\u2019t all bad, but he was strictly limited to suggesting ways to make very loud noises, unexpectedly, and especially around adults.\nIt wasn\u2019t a terrible job, but some of the other demons got to whisper much darker things, and not just to children.\nTintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl knew he was a young demon, and he\u2019d work his way up, but it was a long way to go still.\nSo that was where he was headed when he came out of his house, and then Eugenia saw him explode into a thousand blue and green blow-flies, and shoot up into the sky in a swirling stream.\nWhen he was gone, Eugenia heard the faintest little muffled cry, \u201cOh, help!\u201d\nShe knew Ruth\u2019s voice even under these decidedly strange circumstances, so she cautiously tiptoed to the front of the house, and opened the door.\nEven a right-side-up Ruth that had been bound would have been a horror for poor Eugenia to see, but an upside-down Ruth was almost too much to bear.\nRuth had worked her chin up and down enough so some of the yarn was loose, and she said: \u201cEugenia! Help! Find the end of the string and unravel me!\u201d\n\u201cBut where?\u201d Because there was a great deal of yarn wrapped everywhere around Ruth.\nTintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl had also bound Ruth\u2019s wrists with a thick bit of slime, so she couldn\u2019t even point.\n\u201cWrapped around my head, I think,\u201d Eugenia said, and so she started looking for the end of the string around Ruth\u2019s head. She fumbled a bit, and then found the end, and started unraveling and unspooling it, bit by bit.\nIn no time she was using all her strength to lower Ruth to the ground.\nWhen Ruth finally got her wits about her, which didn\u2019t take long, she gave Eugenia a big kiss right on the cheek.\n\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d she asked. \u201cNo, no, no time now, quick, find those knitting needles. Hurry, hurry, he\u2019s going to be back soon\u2014\u201c\n\u201cWho?\u201d Eugenia said.\n\u201cTintamarre-ruckus-and-brawl \u2014 oh, I don\u2019t remember now!\u201d Ruth said. \u201cI am an old, old woman, and my memory is no good. But I think, if you undo these bindings I could knit us a bag to catch that little devil in, if nothing else.\u201d\nSo even though it made her stomach twitch, Eugenia pulled the slime off of Ruth\u2019s wrists and found the knitting needles and handed them over.\nRuth started furiously knitting. Eugenia didn\u2019t have a word to say, but she tried her hardest to be useful, so she tried to remember what Hen-Who-Runs-Backwards and Pig-on-his-Hind-legs had said.\n\u201cIt is all my fault, of course,\u201d Eugenia said. \u201cYou know very well that I knew you would \u2014 I really shouldn\u2019t have asked.\u201d\nRuth frowned, but kept knitting.\n\u201cNot your fault at all. I really should stick to kitting stuff, well, more earthly. I am much to old to conjure demons.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if we have to stay here forever? And he hangs us both upside down? I can\u2019t knit! Ruth, I just can\u2019t do it. My hands are not clever like yours \u2014 all I wanted was a little child, to leave a little something to the world \u2014 Tintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl, that\u2019s it!\u201d Eugenia said suddenly remembering, \u201cthat\u2019s who likes bacon and eggs, that\u2019s what the hen and the pig said.\u201d\nRuth just smiled and knitted and knitted and smiled.\nWhen Tintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl came home that evening, he was very hungry and grouchy after a long day of work.\nHe was also quite disappointed to find Ruth had managed to unbind herself, and was sitting quietly on a big lump of mud that he used for a sofa.\n\u201cSoooo, Rutheee, you old waggle-waggle-hag, you got out? But you can\u2019t go home! Can\u2019t go home!\u201d\nTintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl stomach was rumbling.\nAnd it should be known he was thinking quite seriously of eating up Ruth, but finally he thought she might be a bit tough to chew, so he had decided against it. At least for the moment.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in the bag?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cOh, nothing you\u2019d be interested in,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cJust some bacon and eggs.\u201d\nHen-Who-Runs-Backwards and Pig-On-His-Hind-Legs had spoke the truth, because just that day they\u2019d been held captive and he had let them in order to make room for Ruth. Tintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl little horns unrolled themselves, his ears perked up and he sniffed the air.\n\u201cGive it to me, then,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to come get it,\u201d Ruth said, and opened up the bag.\n\u201cJust in case, so you stay \u2014 shush, shush, shush, Rutheeee!\u201d Tintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl said, blew his nose into his hand, and flung a palmful of sticky slime right at Ruth. Indeed, it stuck right over her mouth, so she couldn\u2019t say a word.\nThen, without another thought, Tintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl dove head first into the bag.\nRuth pulled the drawstring tight.\n\u201cNo bacon and eggs!\u201d he screeched, \u201cNothing! Nothing! It\u2019s a trick!\u201d\nHe started tearing away at the bag opening.\nIf you were wondering where Eugenia was this whole time, she was right behind the door, and she jumped out and said: \u201cTintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl, behave!\u201d\nAnd of course, Tintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl had to, and as long as they could remember his name, he had to do what they said.\nThis is nearly the end of the story, because what came next is quite expected and does not require many details.\nRuth and Eugenia made Tintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl take them straight back to their little house in the mortal world.\nBut it should be clearly noted, that bravery and faithfulness is sometimes rewarded in unexpected ways: Eugenia did get her wish to have a child, but just not quite the child she had in mind.\nRuth thought that Tintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl looked adorable in the little outfits she\u2019d knit for him, and Eugenia thought him to be the perfect child, because unlike most children, all she had to do was say, \u201cTintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl, behave!\u201d and like magic he\u2019d behave.\nAlso, it wouldn\u2019t be fair to say that Tintamarre-ruckus-bedlam-pother-and-brawl truly hated this arrangement, it was at least a bit more satisfying than his day job, and from time to time if he behaved, he\u2019d get bacon eggs for breakfast, and sometimes even a noisy little doggy for dinner.\nAnd of course, they lived happily ever after.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

She pressed up closer to the men so that the sharp edge of her tray was at their necks. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d she said again. \u201cMay I sneak past you?\u201d\nThe men stared at her for a moment with expressions like she\u2019d just pulled a gun. The first selected a shrimp with his fingers, then both stepped into the house.\n\u201cDon\u2019t know why she couldn\u2019t wait,\u201d said the first. \u201cA little cruel, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s new enough,\u201d said the second. \u201cLet it go.\u201d\nShannon crossed through, and onto the patio. It was choked with decorations: plastic pumpkins, cornucopias, a wooden table for twelve set with manikins decked out so fully in pilgrim costumes that she couldn\u2019t bear to look at them. Everyone in town was there, more people than she could ever hope to recognize. Their nice dress was the same cut as their lab coats, only darker.\nHelena emerged from the fog of voices at Shannon\u2019s left.\n\u201cOh, there you are!\u201d she called. \u201cHere, here, here!\u201d\nShe grabbed Shannon\u2019s free elbow and dragged her down the stepping stones, which tonight were lit by flimsy plastic candy corns.\n\u201cMy husband,\u201d Helena said, pausing every few moments to press a sharp heel on the center of each steppingstone, \u201chas been looking for you all night.\u201d\nShannon wrenched her elbow from Helena\u2019s grasp so as not to drop her shrimp into the grass. Helena\u2019s husband was her boss, the lab president. He asked that Shannon call him Mr. President.\n\u201cDo you know what he wants?\u201d Shannon asked.\nShe was here tonight on his orders. She was his secretary. She had helped to decorate and taken people\u2019s names down at the door.\n\u201cOh, well,\u201d Helena said. \u201cYou know how he can be.\u201d\nShe spun around to hold her face in front of Shannon\u2019s. It was large. Her skin was as taught as a nitrile glove and Shannon could smell the sour on her breath.\n\u201cWon\u2019t tell you a thing till he thinks you need to know,\u201d Helena said. She smiled, but she couldn\u2019t look Shannon in the eye.\nShe continued on to a green plastic lawn table near the fence. Her husband and the Russian woman who\u2019d just moved into town sat around it in unmatched chairs, neither speaking.\n\u201cHere she is, I found her,\u201d Helena announced.\n\u201cShrimp?\u201d Shannon asked them both, shifting the tray from her shoulder to both hands.\n\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Helena\u2019s husband said.\n\u201cWould you like to set the tray down?\u201d the Russian asked. Shannon was surprised at how light an accent she had, compared to what people said of her, at least. She spoke like a Midwesterner, just a little bit slower and with less bounce.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Shannon said, not wanting to reveal she was studying the Russian\u2019s voice. She couldn\u2019t think of how to complete her sentence.\n\u201cOh, for Pete\u2019s sake,\u201d Helena cut in. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I hardly noticed, I didn\u2019t realize. Yes, go set the tray down first, go absolutely. How cruel of me to neglect you like that!\u201d\n\u201cWhere should I put it?\u201d\n\u201cOver by the table would be fine,\u201d Helena said. She swept an arm toward the long table with the manikins. Casserole dishes and crock pots crowded the top.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be right back, then,\u201d Shannon said, bowing her head to Helena\u2019s husband in apology.\nThe table was so covered in food that Shannon had to rearrange everything to make room for her tray. She set it atop a pan of half finished, breadcrumb-crusted macaroni and cheese and set about pushing dishes toward the center of the table. Even with this, there wasn\u2019t quite space for the shrimp, and she had to move one pilgrim manikin\u2019s hands from the table and set the shrimp where he should have had a plate.\nThere was something unnerving about lifting the plastic hands \u2014 how realistically they were molded, down to the Plexiglas that took the place of their fingernails. Shannon could imagine the care they had been crafted with: someone attending to every detail. Who?\nShe wished she didn\u2019t have to touch them.\nAside from this, it was nice to set the food down. People grabbed food from around her without asking anything. How great it was, temporarily, not to be noticed. How easy it would be to not exist \u2026\nWhen she returned to the plastic table by the fence, Helena\u2019s voice had grown louder: Her husband would likely ask Shannon to take her drink away soon.\n\u201cIn Paris in the War!\u201d Helena said. \u201cI\u2019d have been terrified! That man was evil, I can tell you that much.\u201d\nThe Russian lowered her head.\n\u201cYou do become used to it,\u201d she said.\n\u201cYes, but still! Can I tell you something honestly, as friends?\u201d Helena said. She didn\u2019t wait for confirmation. \u201cI was all the way out here, away from everything, and were it not for this man \u2026\u201d\nShe reached to pat her husband\u2019s collar. Her fingers fell on his neck. He stiffened up.\n\u201cWith all that we do, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019d still be here\u2026\u201d\nThey were silent for a moment, till her husband caught sight of Shannon standing right next to them.\n\u201cShannon,\u201d he said. \u201cGood, you\u2019re back. I needed you for something.\u201d\nHelena shook as though woken from a dream. Her husband stood and pushed his chair under the table.\n\u201cExcuse us, ladies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a little bit of business to attend to. Shouldn\u2019t take us too long at all. I\u2019ll be right back to humor you.\u201d\n\u201cYou have no reason to worry,\u201d the Russian said.\n\u201cWe won\u2019t,\u201d Helena\u2019s husband said.\nHelena blushed.\nHe pushed off toward the house. Shannon knew he expected her to follow. She maneuvered through the crowd after him, cutting sometimes between people in conversation.\n\u201cMr. President,\u201d she called when she caught up to him beside the serving table. \u201cMr. President, what did you want me for?\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t talk about it here,\u201d he said. She had to jog to keep up. \u201cNot everyone here is authorized to hear.\u201d He continued on toward the house, holding his hand up to let people approaching him know he wouldn\u2019t talk.\nShannon tried to walk as close to him as she could, so that some of his importance might spread to her. She was unsure how serious the president was about the secrecy of whatever it was they were doing. It seemed like a joke, but she\u2019d needed federal security clearance just to apply for this job. The party itself was considered a state secret.\nInside his house a few elderly women were chatting, and the visiting General was eyeing portraits on the wall. Slight discolorations in the wood of the buffet table indicated that items of value had been hidden away.\nThe president turned down a hallway that Shannon guessed went to the bedrooms. The walls were lined with framed photos of him and Helena in wool jackets with snow-capped mountains visible in the distance behind them, or miniature in the corner of the frame, the sea and a pastel cityscape stretching beyond them.\nShannon had never seen the sea before. She thought that it was silent.\n\u201cWhere are we going, Mr. President?\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t answer at first but opened what looked to be a closet door. A thin set of concrete stairs spiraled down behind it. He stepped down a few of them, then answered: \u201cNow that I\u2019ve got you at the house, I figured I might show you something special. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not much. I just thought it might help you with your job later.\u201d\nShannon followed him down the stairs. The walls were of a mortared cinder block, and they gave off a coolness that hummed. The president unlocked a deadbolt at the bottom and they entered a larger concrete room, one stretching past visibility in both directions.\nShannon had been to the tunnels before \u2014 they connected her office to the bus stop \u2014 but she\u2019d not known they connected to the houses. She hoped none connected to her home.\nThe president went only a yard into the tunnel. He unlocked the first door on the right and ushered Shannon in before him. This, too, was cold.\nIt was a conference room of some sort. The concrete walls were hidden behind floral wallpaper with a repeating ivy motif. A painted garden hung along one side in imitation of a window. A table \u2014 the same kind as the serving table upstairs \u2014 filled up most of the room, its wood veneer appearing warm in the artificial light. They had to be somewhere underneath the patio. A murmur of the party leaked in from above.\n\u201cSit,\u201d said Mr. President. \u201cPlease, sit.\u201d\nShannon took the seat two away from the end and studied the garden scene while the president searched through a large metal cabinet opposite the door. The garden couldn\u2019t have been local. Only shortgrass, wheat, and wetlands lived out this way, and this garden was a tangle of purple flowers and broad leaves. It looked so fanciful, like it could never in natural, normal life exist.\nThe president was taking his time in the metal cabinet, shuffling cardboard boxes and mumbling to himself.\nShannon took a moment to shut her eyes and let the murmurs above wash over her. This was the first time she\u2019d been able to sit all night. She\u2019d need a glass of water when she went back above ground. That\u2019s all that was bothering her now: She needed water. One sip alone would be enough to loosen her chest.\nShe was just a few yards away from the whole party. The president was likely pulling out another loyalty oath. He had a thing for having employees sign them, the rumor being he\u2019d had some assistants poached by labs nearer the coast. Shannon could take her time reading over whatever agreement he made her sign, both so he\u2019d feel safe about it and so she could have a little time to catch her breath. It was something she could laugh about later: the president was so paranoid he couldn\u2019t enjoy his own Thanksgiving. Soon enough she\u2019d meet a nice co-worker. She\u2019d have somebody to make jokes with.\nWhen the president turned around he was holding a leather suitcase.\n\u201cHands off the table,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, trust me, you\u2019ll regret it real soon if you don\u2019t.\u201d\nShe put her hands on her lap and he unlatched the suitcase. Crouching a bit, he poured its contents across the table.\nThey were fingers: fingers unattached to any hands, fingers of every race and size, some with rings of gold wrapped tight around them, some with deep black bruises underneath their nails.\nShannon backed away, afraid the fingers might spill onto her lap, but because of the size of the room she could only go one chair length back.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d said the president. \u201cPlease.\u201d\nShannon said nothing but watched him. What was he doing to her? He didn\u2019t even look in her direction.\n\u201cThey\u2019re just something I picked up in my years of travel,\u201d he said as he turned back to the metal closet. \u201cYou might go ahead and call it research, but\u2026\u201d\nHe turned around with a terracotta pot cradled in his arms.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve yet to see my favorite part,\u201d he said.\nHe was smiling. Shannon couldn\u2019t watch his eyes, only his teeth. He\u2019d had them whitened.\nHe brushed some fingers from the edge of the table, letting a few fall to the carpeted floor. They made no sound. Not even a plop. He set the pot on the clean part of the table then set about examining the fingers, lifting them from the table and measuring each individually against his own.\n\u201cSome are better than others, of course,\u201d he said. But it took him no more than a minute to select four long ones and a thumb. He pressed each firmly into the dirt of the pot so they resembled a mismatched hand reaching out from the potted earth. He pulled another pot from the closet and did the same.\nTwo hands set beside each other, frozen in the dirt.\n\u201cNow this,\u201d said the president, \u201cthis is what excites me.\u201d\nHe reached near the bottom of each pot and pulled a small lever on each that Shannon had not seen before. The fingers began wriggling like either inchworms, viewed individually, or complete hands struggling to escape the dirt, viewed as a whole. Clumps of soil shifted to make room for the moving hands, but they didn\u2019t rise so much as an inch from the dirt. They simply wriggled.\nShannon listened to the murmur above her, trying to locate words. She couldn\u2019t turn her eyes from the hands, they were so mesmerizing, but maybe she could turn away from the sound, the jittering squeal equal parts mechanical and organic, some impossible mix of a mouse and a rusty typewriter. She tried to picture the party above her but could imagine only distance \u2014 fifteen feet of dirt and solid concrete, and she was stuck underneath with these wriggling hands.\n\u201cWhy are you showing me this?\u201d she asked. It hurt to speak. She realized that she had lost her breath.\n\u201cWell, for one thing I like them,\u201d said the president. He smiled again, as though to show he were telling the truth. \u201cBut of course that isn\u2019t all of it,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis isn\u2019t what you\u2019re asking.\u201d\nHe let his smile falter some. Here was his serious face, which he wore whenever he called her to his office. His lips were pressed so far in on themselves they disappeared. It was a normal expression. She saw it every day. She was comfortable with it.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be honest with you, it\u2019s because I know you won\u2019t tell a soul. Who would believe you, Shannon? No, come Monday you\u2019ll be back in my office as usual, doing whatever it is I make you do. You\u2019re reliable like that.\u201d\nSurely Mr. President was wrong. There were maybe a hundred people above them now: she could hear the soft and friendly murmur of their voices. She could tell them what the president had done, and they\u2019d be shocked as well. They would believe her. They wouldn\u2019t want to work for a man who kept live fingers in his house. They would be just as afraid.\nBut the president was right. She didn\u2019t tell a soul. That Monday she was early to the office, and when he asked her to fetch him some test tubes from the fridge she did, even though they were cold as plastic fingers.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

I know because one has spoken to me since I was nine.\nAt first I didn\u2019t understand it, but as the fire incinerated its prehistoric flesh and turned it to ash, what it was conveying became perfectly clear, and even though the giant Chelydra serpentina (its technical name) has been dead for nearly twenty years, it only stopped talking to me recently.\nIt all began when I was tossing around a football with my best friend, Dennis, and some older kids emerged from behind the cluster of trees concealing a tiny stream in back of the elementary school we attended.\nThey were carrying a large object to a barrel used by the school\u2019s janitor, Mr. Johnson, to burn trash. When they reached it, they lowered it into the rusty metal container letting it drop the last couple of feet with a loud thud.\n\u201cWhat do you think they\u2019re doing?\u201d I asked Dennis, who suggested we go see.\nAnother boy approached carrying a small tin can.\n\u201cHere\u2019s the kerosene,\u201d he announced and poured it into the barrel.\nDennis braved the question about what they were up to and was told they were going to set fire to a turtle.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I inquired incredulously, and the boy with the fuel can answered that they were burning it as an experiment.\n\u201cWe want to see what it does. See if its shell keeps it from melting. Besides, it\u2019s just a nasty old snapper. No good for nothing.\u201d he added, tossing the empty container to the ground a few feet from where we stood.\n\u201cOkay, here goes,\u201d announced another kid, striking a wooden match and dropping it into the barrel.\nFlames leapt up instantly, and everyone took a few steps back in awe. In the whoosh of the flames I heard a squealing sound, but Dennis claimed he didn\u2019t. When the flames settled down after a few minutes, everyone closed in on the barrel except me.\n\u201cCome on, let\u2019s look,\u201d said Dennis excitedly.\n\u201cThat\u2019s wrong!\u201d I replied, but he ignored my protest and joined the boys peering into the barrel.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d I shouted but no one paid attention to me.\nAgain, I heard a squeal emanate from the barrel, but this time it was followed by a series of sharp grunts that mixed with the crackling and snapping of the flames that spewed embers into the air.\n\u201cIt\u2019s suffering,\u201d I protested, and was told to shut up by the oldest of the boys, who was probing the depths of the barrel with a stick.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still moving,\u201d he announced ecstatically, and everyone, including Dennis, eagerly took a turn poking at the baking terrapin.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to tell,\u201d I warned, and the big kid, who obviously was the leader of the group, said if I did I\u2019d be sorry.\n\u201cWell, I am getting the police,\u201d I threatened, and he waved his clenched fist at me menacingly.\nThat was when the turtle first spoke to me.\n\u201cThey know not what they do, so leave them to their senseless deed,\u201d it said.\nMore than a little startled I probed the expressions of the other boys to see if they, too, had heard the words of the dying reptile. It was clear they had not, because they continued to behave with gleeful abandon as they stared into the barrel.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s dead,\u201d claimed one of the boys.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s still moving,\u201d responded another.\n\u201cIt\u2019s roasted,\u201d observed yet another. \u201cNo way it can be alive.\u201d\nBut it was alive, because it kept speaking.\n\u201cNothing ever really perishes,\u201d it declared, adding, \u201cThings become something else, but they continue to exist. So don\u2019t fret, young man. You are good to care for me and see the wrong in what they do, but there is nothing more you can do. You have done what any decent and noble living thing should. You have opposed cruelty, and I commend you for doing so.\u201d\nStill, I wanted to beat up the boys for killing the turtle, and I was mad at Dennis for going along with them and not joining me in trying to prevent their malicious act.\nAfter about a half hour, the oldest boy pronounced the turtle officially dead and the others, including Dennis, agreed, each carefully examining the barrel\u2019s depths.\nBy that time, I had retreated to the edge of the field, and when Dennis waved at me, I turned and ran for home.\n\u201cIt\u2019s dead! It\u2019s dead!\u201d they sang out and began marching around the smoldering tomb as if engaged in some primitive ritual.\nI told no one about the turtle talking to me that day, and although it has spoken to me ever since, I have not dared to reveal this fearing I would be thought crazy, even by those closest to me.\n\u201cKids can be so cruel,\u201d commented my mother when I told my parents what happened.\n\u201cWell, it was only a turtle,\u201d replied my father, folding the day\u2019s newspaper in half and placing it on the coffee table.\n\u201cStill, that\u2019s not a very kind thing to do,\u201d said my mother shaking her head in disapproval.\n\u201cPeople make soup of those things, you know,\u201d added my father. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re human.\u201d\n\u201cBut burning it to death. That\u2019s just wrong,\u201d I chimed in.\n\u201cIt is wrong,\u201d agreed my mother. \u201cThe poor thing. It deserved better.\u201d\n\u201cYou two are just like each other,\u201d snapped my father, and I nodded in happy agreement as he lifted the paper from the coffee table and began reading it again.\nAfter the grim episode of that day, I stopped hanging out with Dennis, and a year later my family moved to another part of town.\nA decade passed before I saw him again. We bumped into each other in a bookstore. We were both attending college, and he was there looking for a title he needed in a course, and I was there scanning the mythology section, a subject that came to interest me greatly.\nDespite my continuing dialogue with the turtle, which remained very secretive about itself, I began to study up on reptiles and the myths that different cultures ascribe to them.\nThe one I liked best claimed that turtles possessed the wisdom of the world. That was certainly true of the one that had befriended me and imbued my thoughts with its sage insights and perspectives on the meaning and purpose of existence.\nAt first my conversation with Dennis was a bit awkward, but then we both seemed to relax a little over a cup of coffee. He was majoring in business and already was engaged to someone he had dated throughout high school. He was impressed when I told him I was in pre-med with plans to attend veterinary school.\n\u201cYou always were kind of a brain,\u201d he replied, \u201cand a little weird, too, but in a good way,\u201d he added with a slight chuckle.\nIt took some gumption for me to ask if he remembered the burning turtle incident, but it was something I felt compelled to do. I had never reconciled how my best friend could go along with such a heinous act.\n\u201cWhat? Say that again,\u201d he replied in a perplexed tone.\n\u201cYou know, when those older boys put a turtle in a barrel and burned it to death,\u201d I pressed.\n\u201cMan, I don\u2019t remember that at all,\u201d he answered looking like he\u2019d just caught a whiff of something rancid.\n\u201cCome on, \u201d I protested, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have forgotten that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, if it happened, I sure don\u2019t remember it. Kids do a lot of weird things. You can\u2019t remember all of them. What\u2019s the big deal anyway? It was just a turtle. Not like someone was killed.\u201d\nI could feel the blood rush into my cheeks and my body tense up. How could he forget such a horrible thing, I wondered? Was he just pretending not to recall what was one of the most disturbing and altering experiences of my life? It was then that I lost it.\n\u201cYou creep! It was a helpless creature you helped kill, and it was so much more than that . . . more than you could ever know!\u201d\nWith those words I stormed out of the bookstore\u2019s cafe before giving in to the urge to clobber him. In the years since, thanks to the wisdom of the burning turtle, I have come to better understand people like Dennis and those who act with such utter disregard for life. From it I also learned forgiveness. It was the hardest lesson of all but the one that rewarded me most.\n\u201cLet go resentment for it sours the soul and blocks the path to true fulfillment. Do good to those who hate you. It will disarm them swifter than any other act. Remember, you alone are responsible for what you feel and who you become, so choose wisely,\u201d it advised, and I did.\nThe turtle had enhanced every aspect of my life and I felt blessed that it had chosen to guide me through the challenges and travails that confronted me as I made my way through the years. My relations with all living things transcended the commonplace because of its devoted tutelage.\nIt was not long after my son entered the world that the voice of the turtle went silent, and I knew with complete certainty that it had migrated into my newborn. No parent could have been happier or wish for anything more for their child. At his christening the minister chose to read a verse from the Bible that meant more to me than he could ever imagine.\nRise up my love, my fair one, and come away\nFor lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;\nThe flowers appear on the earth; the time of the\nsinging of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is\nheard in our land.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Just because my grandparents used to live on Earth doesn\u2019t mean we have to go back.\nWould a butterfly look back at its cocoon and think, boy I miss that? No. It wouldn\u2019t. It would grow its wings and fly. Fly away from the past and into the future.\nStaring at an empty cocoon, I hear Mom come looking for me.\n\u201cLily. Lily, baby, where are you?\u201d\nI think about not saying anything, then of calling back, then decide to stay quiet. She\u2019ll find me. It\u2019s hard to miss red hair in a garden.\nI watch through the gaps in the daffodils as Mom gets closer. Bugs fly away scared as she walks through the flowers. I feel bad for them. This garden is supposed to be their paradise. I think that\u2019s why they named it Eden. Mom told me why but I forget the story sometimes.\n\u201cLily?\u201d\nShe keeps calling, like the cicadas or the Catastrophe Alarm System. I run my finger against the old cocoon stuck to the leaf of a flower I don\u2019t know the name of yet. It cracks.\n\u201cLily, baby, what are you doing?\u201d she says. \u201cYou can\u2019t just run away like that.\u201d\nMom must have seen my red roots through the yellow buds and green stems. I stay silent, and imagine I am a flower minding my own business, happy with my neighbors in the garden. Fine with the ladybugs walking on my arms and the bumblebees smelling my hair. Late for nothing. Nothing expected of me. I am free.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to get filthy,\u201d Mom says as she holds out her hand to pluck me from the dirt. My toes are nothing like the roots of the other flowers; Mom tugs on me and up I go.\n\u201cIf you really wanted to hide from me, you\u2019d pick a better hiding place than here,\u201d Mom says, brushing the dirt off me.\nI know that. I\u2019m not stupid. There are hundreds of places I could have hidden where she would never find me. I could have gone into one of the storage units or the med-bay. I could have even gotten into the big room with the machine that pumps all the oxygen everywhere. I know the codes \u2014 I saw Mom type them into the keypad once. I could have gone anywhere on the moon and it would have been hours before Mom would have found me.\nI came to Eden because I didn\u2019t care. I didn\u2019t care if it took her five minutes or five hours to find me. I just wanted to be with the flowers. I wanted to be with the things that make me happy.\n\u201cFunny thing I named you Lily,\u201d Mom says, \u201cit\u2019s almost like I knew you\u2019d love the garden.\u201d Mom smiles as she says that, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s funny. She\u2019s really smart, but she doesn\u2019t know everything about me.\nAnd when she thinks she does and says stupid things like, \u201cfunny thing I named you Lily,\u201d it makes me feel so small. Like I\u2019m that caterpillar about to become a butterfly and the other bugs say to me: \u201cFunny thing you\u2019re building a cocoon, we knew you\u2019d do that, Lily.\u201d\nDragging me from my spot by the daffodils, I watch as Mom crushes some poor flowers. She never even took off her boots, which is against the rules.\n\u201cDon\u2019t step on them!\u201d\n\u201cFinally she speaks,\u201d Mom says. \u201cWe have plenty of seeds. The Harvesters can plant more.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I say, trying to tug my wrist out of Mom\u2019s hand. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to take off your shoes in Eden. The sign says.\u201d\nI point to the metal sign by the exit, it asks that visitors \u201cremove all footwear, exo-gear, and any other materials harmful to the flora.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t even look. \u201cI just had to run in here to pick you up,\u201d she says. \u201cNo time to get my feet dirty.\u201d\nMom holds my arm like she holds her toolbox. The calluses on her hands scrape and hurt. We walk up to the exit-pod doors, go inside, and Mom lets go of my arm. I rub where her fingers wrapped around my wrist.\nThe doors close behind us, and the voice on the speakers counts down to decontamination. Then a cloud of mist sprays down from tiny holes in the ceiling. I close my eyes. I think of the little bugs and things in Eden that get their wings too wet when the misters come on. Then they get stuck and can\u2019t fly.\nI don\u2019t like that thought so I think about being a flower in Eden instead. I don\u2019t know what Mom is imagining, or if she even does anymore.\n\u201cDecontamination complete,\u201d the voice on the speakers says, \u201c Have a nice day.\u201d\nThe doors away from Eden open and Mom and I step through. The metal floors make my bare feet sting or tickle. I don\u2019t know what to call it other than cold. Little clumps of dirt stick between my toes and crumble away as Mom and I walk.\nRight outside of Eden is a big window where you can see all over the moon. I look out the window, and Mom does too.\n\u201cI know you don\u2019t want to leave. But we have to go,\u201d Mom says.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask her, still looking. The white surface of the moon looks so pretty next to the black sky of space. In that sky there are thousands of little stars shimmering. They don\u2019t care that space is supposed to be black and empty; they want to shine anyway.\nMom holds my chin with her fingers and turns my head so I have to look at her.\n\u201cLily, baby. We were never meant to live here forever.\u201d\nI look back out the window. Along with all the cracks and craters I can see hundreds of metal boxes and tubes that connect them like a constellation. Even though they\u2019re all metal and cold, I still find them kind of beautiful.\n\u201cMaybe you aren\u2019t meant to live here forever,\u201d I say.\nMom looks at me. Actually, I can\u2019t see if she really is or not, I\u2019m still looking out the window, but I can feel her eyes watching me. I can tell she\u2019s mad at me, but I\u2019m mad at her too, so it\u2019s only fair I act this way.\n\u201cThis is all temporary,\u201d she says. I see her raise a hand and point at the colonies. \u201cAll of this is a back-up plan.\u201d\nMom keeps talking, but all I hear are the bugs.\n\u201cFunny thing,\u201d the bugs say\u2026\nI can see from the corner of my eyes that Mom is watching me, but I don\u2019t budge. She sighs and scratches her head. She turns to look back at the doors to Eden and then at me.\n\u201cYou remember the story I told you about the first Eden, right?\u201d She runs a finger through my hair. Some daffodil petals fall onto the floor.\n\u201cI remember.\u201d I hope she doesn\u2019t ask any questions about it.\n\u201cSo you know,\u201d Mom says, \u201cthat the first Eden was on Earth a long, long time ago and we named this one after it, yeah?\u201d\nI stay silent and watch all the dirt crumble off my feet as I wiggle my toes. I look up to see Mom nudging her head towards Eden\u2019s doors. Peeking over my shoulders, I see the plaque next to the entrance: \u201cEden: A promise to cherish what we once forgot.\u201d\n\u201cThe first Eden was on Earth, Lily. Way before I was born, or before Grandma and Grandpa were born.\u201d\nMom takes my hand and gently holds it. The bumps and cuts on her hands don\u2019t hurt me this way.\n\u201cThis Eden,\u201d she says, tilting her head towards the metal doors, \u201cwas made to remember what we once had. The flowers, the bugs, everything we lost on Earth. But now we can go back.\u201d\nMom lets go of my hand and stands up. \u201cC\u2019mon. I want you to see something.\u201d\nTogether, we walk across the station. We pass by more windows; I can see the storage facility, the med-bay, and even the big building where they make the oxygen. Eventually, Mom stops and points out one of the windows.\nI don\u2019t want to look, but \u2026 I see something like a ball floating in black water. Just tough enough to fight against the darkness that was sucking it down. A faraway little bubble.\n\u201cEarth,\u201d Mom says. \u201cToday, the Monitors gave us clearance. It\u2019s safe to return. We can go back.\u201d\nI stare at the little brown ball drowning in space. I tilt my head one way and then the other, but I still don\u2019t see it. I don\u2019t see Earth. I don\u2019t see a home.\nI just see an ugly brown rock floating in space.\n\u201cWhy do we have to? Why can\u2019t I stay here?\u201d\nShe turns to me and holds my head in her hand like I\u2019m a delicate flower. Her eyes look like green planets and her freckles look like stars.\n\u201cBecause you and the rest of the kids are our future, Lily. Grandma and Grandpa are too old, and I\u2019m getting up there too.\u201d\nShe makes a big frown and scrunches up her face; it makes her look a hundred years old. I laugh, but only a little bit.\nMom smiles. \u201cThe earth already had a bunch of old farts everywhere. We think it\u2019s important to have some young people keeping us from doing anything stupid.\u201d\nI laugh again and Mom giggles like she\u2019s a little kid. She looks out at the brown rock floating in space and puts her hand on my back.\n\u201cWe\u2019re lucky, you know.\u201d Mom says.\nI look at her, and for a second she does look a hundred years old. All that laughing made the lines around her eyes deep. She seems tired. \u201cIf Grandma and Grandpa weren\u2019t already stationed on the moon and if they were still down there when it all happened \u2026\u201d\nShe stops talking, just froze, staring at that ugly brown rock like it was made of gold. I got scared and started tugging on her hand.\n\u201cWhat, Mom, what?\u201d I asked, \u201cWhat would have happened to Grandma and Grandpa?\u201d\nShe turns to me and smiles the way I smile when I\u2019m hiding something from her.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just lucky, aren\u2019t we Lily, baby?\u201d she says.\nI hate grown-ups.\nMom puts her hand on the back of my head and plays with my hair. I don\u2019t brush it enough so she keeps getting her fingers stuck. I think that\u2019s why she wears her hair in a ponytail all the time. The red tangle that comes out the back of her head looks like jet fire from a spaceship.\nI still don\u2019t want to go to Earth.\n\u201cAll of Earth can be like your garden. Like Eden,\u201d she says. Mom runs her thumb down my cheek. \u201cI hoped for this. That\u2019s why I named you Lily.\u201d\nShe kisses me on my forehead and looks back out the window. I turn away from Mom and look out the window too. The darkness of space turns the glass into a mirror. I can see Earth resting between my green eyes and surrounded by a storm of freckles.\nI stare at Earth and imagine what it would look like green.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Brown. Smoothed dull by her thirteen years. She dared not flush.\nLater her mother would take her to the doctor to learn she would always be small, her pelvis broken by a simple wish for a child and so she would remain. Childless. And her mother would say, Well start a rock collection.\nThis phrase a substitute for her own broken heart. Burying phantom grandchildren, already. Tiny graves, though. The size of a finger poked in the dirt to make a hole for three sister seeds. Corn. Bean. Now squash.\nAnd had she not already done that a million seasons? But her daughter had not.\nEach month she threw the stones away, out of her pocket on walks to school, in the trash. She tended other things. Squirrel on the feeder. Rabbit she fed sugar to from a Dixie cup on the back porch that her brother eventually shot. She buried it and considered the tiny teeth that had nibbled at the thick skin of her thumbprint.\nIt was not so thick, her skin, and so she resolved to toughen it. Black leather, jagged hair. Boys. Men, even. But this, this neither, could keep her from a truth. Not of the stones but of the place from where they had come. That bathroom. That place. To discover that there were a million ways to be a mother except for her. Its dinge, promise of vagrance, smell of bleached shit. She felt like that. Childless always and now. Junky. Like the rabbit\u2019s bones under the dirt. Rotten. Body stretched thin by needles until.\nHow long will a rabbit live unshot?\nAnd when she had had enough, she was back there squatting over the toilet that her mother had told her was too dirty to touch.

A clerk greeted him, asked what he could help him with today. He pushed past to get inside.\nA few days ago, the tree\u2019s mother had gone missing.\nIt was his cousin\u2019s birthday and his family usually did something to celebrate. Usually something small because his cousin, barely a sapling, would be too young to remember any of it. His family had decided to meet at the hiking trail. It was hot that day and the trees talked about what trees talk about: the seasons, the weather. Anything pertinent to their water supply.\nBut about an hour or so into the party, he noticed his mother still had not arrived. So he began to ask around. Calmly, at first. And then Cindy, a hiker stretching into a triangle pose underneath his shade, told him that he should check out Bill\u2019s hardware store.\n\u201cJust in case,\u201d she said, shrugging. \u201cYou never know.\u201d\nHe waited a few days to see if his mother would return home on her own. When she did not, he did as Cindy suggested.\nThe tree walked through each aisle. He started with the stationary, separating each pack of card stock into two piles: mom and not-mom. No mom here. Next, aisle three, notebook paper. Aisle seventeen, cardboard boxes. Sketchbooks, wrapping paper, toilet tissue. Still nothing. And then he walked to the plywood section.\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said at first, when he found her. \u201cOh, god.\u201d\nHe reached for a stack of oak panels and dropped it \u2014 her.\nNo one heard him. He bent down to read the labels, his bark bending, too.\nSanded. Hardwood. Sheathed. Treated.\n\u201cTreated?\u201d he asked. \u201cWith what?\u201d\nHe looked down at the ground, at his roots, at the earthworms he had tracked inside, writhing on the floor \u2014 hardwood floor, he noted.\nSomeone tapped him on the shoulder: \u201cExcuse me, but aren\u2019t you the tree from the main hiking trail?\u201d\nHe shrugged her off. He waited in line. He bought his mother.\n* * *\nAfter the funeral, the tree wandered to distant parks, crossed state lines to reach far-away rivers, to wade through auburn stretches of wheat.\nHe would plant himself alongside highways, watching cars zip past him, past each other, 75 miles per hour. Every morning, when the traffic would get heavy and the honking would wake him, he would unroot himself and begin walking.\nNowhere specific. Just away.\nAt first he was determined to find Bill \u2014 for revenge, he would later be embarrassed to admit \u2014 but he heard Bill\u2019s wife had cancer, so he let it go.\nOne night, after a particularly loud bout of honking, he walked, exhausted, to a new place: a small, private hillside overlooking a cliff. In the morning, he awoke in a field of yawning venus flytraps. He befriended them; when they seemed hungry, he shook some of the spiders that lived in his branches loose from their webs and into the oval, spine-toothed mouths. He felt like a father. Briefly.\nThen the thought reminded him of his mother, so up he went, on he went.\n* * *\nThe tree fell in love with a woman.\nShe passed him on a morning walk, holding her baby close to her chest so the wind would not hit his face, and the tree just said it. He said hello. She was the first person he had seen in months.\nStartled, she turned around.\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d\nAfter some explaining \u2014 trees did not talk where she was from \u2014 they became friends. She saw him every day, sometimes even two or three times a day.\n\u201cMy husband,\u201d she would say, \u201cis never home. And when he is, all he does is yell. So what\u2019s the point?\u201d\nThey would talk for hours about her father and his fishing business, about her six-month old son, Thomas, about the tree\u2019s mother and all of the lakes and terrains and strangers he had come to know. She taught him advanced math. Never using paper, of course.\nHe liked her and her long, thoughtful silences. He liked her habits \u2014 the way she threw her head back every time she laughed and said, \u201cThey don\u2019t teach you that in school, do they?\u201d\nHe liked her so much and for so long that he loved her.\nOne day, at her suggestion, they spent three hours working their way through each of the \u201cThirty-Six Questions that Lead to Love\u201d that she had found in a magazine article. After they were finished, she said, \u201cThis is my way of telling you I\u2019d like to be with you. You, me, and Thomas.\u201d\nThe tree was elated.\n* * *\nShe loved him, too. She ate his leaves, his fruit. She climbed his branches when wild boar tumbled through the fields, ripping through the berry-shaped flowers with their hooves. She and Thomas slept in a bed he built for them using his own branches.\nHe gave. She received. And by receiving, she was giving him something, too, she reassured herself. Purpose.\nAlthough their sex life was complicated, she soon got pregnant and gave birth to a small swarm of purple dragonflies.\n\u201cIt was like millions of tiny little bubbles popping,\u201d she said afterward.\nThe dragonflies slept beside her, collectively a buzzing, plum-colored cloud that always seemed to loom slightly out of reach. It hurt her when, with bodies as thin as matchsticks, they left for a wilder wilderness. The tree waved goodbye as they dispersed. She wept into his bark.\n\u201cI guess this is what it means to be a mother,\u201d she said. \u201cTo let go until they are gone.\u201d\n* * *\nSixty years later, the woman died, as people do.\nFrom a human perspective, they had lived a nice, long life together. Although the dragonflies never came back to visit and they never had more children, they traveled the world together, enrolling Thomas in new schools along the way. They learned new languages. New ways of cooking. But in tree years, it had only been a decade, and the tree, still more than twenty years away from the middle of his life, did not quite know what to do with himself.\nWhen she died, Thomas was getting ready to retire. He was an established accountant with children of his own and lived in a narrow, two-story yellow house in the middle of the suburbs with Barbara, his wife.\nHis relationship with the tree was much better now that he was an adult. As a child, he would endure ruthless bullying from his classmates because, one time in middle school, he had to present a photo of his family in Spanish class, using the present tense to describe them and say things like, el es mi pap\u00e1, ella es mi mam\u00e1, el es alto, ella es amable.\nHis classmates could not conceive of a tree being anyone\u2019s father and they let him know that by shoving notes in his locker. He was Earth-boy, his mother was a tree-hugger, tree-fucker if no teachers were around. It took him until his twenties to forgive his father for being a tree.\nBut now that he was a dad himself, he knew that a dad was a dad, and that a dad who stayed was even more of one.\nSo he would visit him every week, his dad. He, his wife, and his two daughters would have weekly dinners with the tree, eating pumpkin-sage pasta underneath his foliage and bringing buckets full of water for him \u2014 sometimes even acidic mulches or pricey fertilizers if it was a special occasion.\nAt his mother\u2019s funeral, Thomas had taken the wooden wedding ring off her finger before they buried her and handed it to his dad, who insisted he keep it.\n\u201cGive it to my granddaughter when she\u2019s older. Tell her who it\u2019s from.\u201d\nHe nodded and down his mother went \u2014 lowered, lowered, gone. Where else would they bury her but underneath the tree?\n* * *\nYears later, Thomas walked up to the tree as his five grandchildren chased each other in the field where the tree had remained since the funeral. The two of them watched as Thomas\u2019 youngest granddaughter tripped on her untied shoelaces and the oldest, age twelve, picked her up, bent down, and re-tied them for her.\nHe loved being a father and loved being a grandfather even more. He had a feeling his dad felt the same.\n\u201cHey, dad?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cWould you want to come live with us? Barb and I could take you home. Plant you in the backyard. And, well, you\u2019d get to see the grandkids everyday, which \u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh, no, Thomas,\u201d the tree said. \u201cI think I\u2019m meant for here, right here.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t answer right away. Just think about it. Lauren says that little Marnie asks about you all the time, you know. Did I tell you that you were her first word? A week ago?\u201d\nThomas was getting old, close to the age where he wanted his family nearby in case something were to happen. Barb was just as old but she handled it better. And they both agreed that it would probably be best to have the tree around \u2014 at the very least, he could help with all of the grandkids.\nWhen Thomas told her that his dad probably did not want to move into their backyard, Barb suggested they plant a few sexy pine trees in their garden first before asking him again, so the next Friday, before they all met for dinner, they did just that and he relented.\nThe tree insisted again and again that it had nothing to do with the pines, but his bark betrayed him by blushing a deep scarlet-brown.\n* * *\nFall. Winter. Spring. Summer.\n* * *\nEverything they planted in the backyard was seasonal. That was the tree\u2019s primary complaint.\nThe pumpkins were harvested and Jack-o-Lanterned by the end of October. April lilies lived in April and were dead every other month. To his left, they planted a pomegranate tree so steeped in her own grief that she refused to talk to him. It was understandable to the tree; every autumn he would watch as her pomegranates fell to their death on the ground, splitting open, their seeds falling out like red rosary beads spilled on the floor.\nThe apple tree Marnie planted, to keep him company while she went away to college, lost her apples in the same way \u2014 apples and apples thudding to ground when a strong wind hit \u2014 but she had so many, she didn\u2019t seem to care if a few fell.\nThe pine trees lost their needles to root rot a few months after he moved in. Something about improper drainage. Apologetic, Barbara planted new ones \u2014 small seedlings \u2014 and promised him they would grow up quickly.\n* * *\nIt is summer now and the tree has a feeling it will be his last one.\nHe tells this to his great-grandchildren, who say, \u201cHush, grandpa. Don\u2019t be silly. Not in front of the kids.\u201d\nHe had spent the winter with red and green Christmas lights strung around his leaves, ornaments hanging on his branches, heavy. With his permission, of course. He did not mind. It made his great-great-grandchildren happy.\nIn the spring, his great-granddaughter had a gender reveal party in the backyard. The photographs look like this: his great-granddaughter, her bump, a spray of pink confetti, wide open mouths, and of course, him in the background.\nBut it is summer now and it saddens him to think that soon more seasons will pass, and more people will pass, like Thomas, who is buried near his mother, and has been for some time.\nHe would never admit this out loud, but he does not really care for the most recent wave of great-great grandchildren. They are not sensitive to his being a tree. They do their homework on paper in plain sight in front of him. They do not hesitate to put their life problems in terms of \u201cIf a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?\u201d\nOnce, when the adults were watching a football game in the living room, one of the kids snuck out and carved their initials into his bark with a steak knife.\nLast week, there was talk of wildfires.\nNow the alarm blares throughout the city and helicopters repeat the same message overhead: \u201cYou are in a compulsory evacuation zone. Please evacuate immediately.\u201d\nHis great-grandchildren are quick to pack.\nAs they make their final rounds throughout the house, one of them asks what they will do about the tree.\n\u201cOh, right,\u201d they say. \u201cGrandpa.\u201d\nThat afternoon, they hold a family meeting to tell him that they are leaving. He tells them to go, not to worry about him, that he will follow behind.\nThe next morning, the sky is bright orange. Bright like a shock. A jolt.\nThe fires are nearby. He can smell them. So close that the alarms have stopped sounding, that the alarm towers themselves have melted off into puddles where they once stood.\nAnd yet he feels so sleepy. So orange. This is what it must feel like to be an orange tree, he thinks. He feels warm \u2014 enveloped and heavy and warm \u2014 and he swears he could feel a haze of dragonflies droning wildly toward him, coming, finally, to rest on his branches.\nSo, he stays as still as he can \u2014 for them. Rooted.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Sometimes one side had it, sometimes the other, and then there was that long, terrible period when the Park itself was torn \u2014 The New Yorker had a third and The Post had the rest. Look around \u2014 do you see the seam where the workers did the repairs?\u201d\nShe surveys the scene. Hot dog vendors, balloon sellers, dogs and their walkers, shrubbery, paths.\n\u201cNo seam,\u201d she reports.\n\u201cPrecisely! A dead giveaway. If we were standing in the genuine Park right now, it would be obvious, running right over there across from the Zoo. The seam is just one of eleven authenticity indicators.\u201d\nPondering the two institutions, as well as the nature of the city itself, she finds this scenario credible.\n\u201cSo,\u201d she asks, \u201cwhich side are you on?\u201d\n\u201cNeither. I can\u2019t divulge how the Park came into my possession, but it\u2019s time to pass it on to someone who can keep it safe from the media wars.\u201d\nShe wonders: Does she want to risk receiving stolen goods? If so, will she have to live on the lam with the black-ops details of two major journalistic enterprises forever on her tail? She hasn\u2019t even agreed to receive the contraband, yet she can feel her internal diction slipping to the level of old pulp magazine slang.\n\u201cWhy me?\u201d she stalls.\n\u201cYour outfit, of course,\u201d he says.\nShe doesn\u2019t have to look down to remind herself of what she\u2019s wearing, since it\u2019s always the same thing, which she washes out in the sink with Dreft every night before bedtime and drapes over the shower curtain rod to drip dry.\nIt is the dress of many pockets: zippered pockets, sawtooth pockets, flap pockets, and patch pockets, as well as hidden and camouflaged pockets of various shapes and sizes, and pockets sewn into the lining against her skin.\nThis kind of dress runs in her family. Her mother, too, wore one every day, quite flashy since she had a thing for fat faux-pearl buttons; in each of her pockets languished an ancient, light-starved emergency dollar. Her grandmother\u2019s pockets were packed with Iowa loam so that whenever she felt homesick, she could pinch a bit out to savor its taste on her tongue.\nOh, those serene lamplit evenings, their kitchen table a cross between a sewing circle and a surgical theater, as all three of them sat together to micro-suture worn spots.\nYet every morning they\u2019d wake up to surprising configurations, since these pockets have personal itineraries of their own, migrating around a dress at will so you can never get a fix on them.\nAs for her own pockets, she\u2019s always left them empty to honor the idea of keeping possibilities open.\nShe sets down her latte and sighs. Yes, she thinks; her dress would indeed serve as a perfect refuge for the poor, beleaguered Park, so apparently, this guardianship is not only her civic duty but her Great Work as well.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d as she holds out her hand, expecting him to reach into his coat to begin the transfer. Instead, he gives a deep, formal bow, turns abruptly, and strides off.\nImmediately she concludes that not only was he deluded, but that during the few moments she believed his story, she must have been deluded, too, for as every city dweller knows, this kind of thing is contagious.\nStill, as she stands to leave, she can tell that something is different: She\u2019s almost discernibly off-balance, like a ship listing slightly starboard.\nPatting the pockets on her right side, she feels something so new and small that only an emptiness-connoisseur would be able to detect it, no doubt deposited there by sleight of hand, the exact opposite of the pickpocket\u2019s maneuver.\nOnly now does she understand her real motivation: not duty, after all, or even the allure of a Great Work, but a longing to hold the little packet in her palm, turn back its perfect folds, feel that slight weight increasing until it\u2019s so heavy she has to set it down as it expands around her.\nMight this be the true Central Park of the heart, where the hands of the Delacorte Clock point always to midnight, and wolves hunt in packs through the trees?","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Happy April Fool's Day.","hostname":"fabulistmagazine.com","source":"https:\/\/fabulistmagazine.com\/the-subterranean-beasts-of-electric-town\/","sitename":"The Fabulist Words & Art","text":"Lance had finally turned into some kind of a monster. Hal had joked that it was only a matter of time. You are what you eat, he said, and Lance had been consuming nothing but kaiju films for years.\nHe had spent the better part of the last twelve months holed up in the cheapest boarding house south of Shinjuku, trying to write an epic account of how both Shintoism and Buddhism could be explained by the likes of Mothra or Rodan.\nAnd now Lance found himself looking like the son of Godzilla \u2014 or at least a distant cousin.\nHe was sprawled out on the tracks of a metro station still under construction, the empty platform lit only by work lights hanging from the overhead railing. By his own estimate, Lance was now at least twenty feet tall, not counting the spiked tail.\nHis arms had become short and ended in three clawed fingers, his feet thick and rounded. His nose, already prodigious, had grown into a snout, his nostrils flaring with the glow of a dim internal fire. His curly locks had diminished into a pebbly textured green flesh and his teeth had become predictably sharp and jagged.\nThe only thing remaining from his previous incarnation was a sweat-stained Tokyo Giants cap that had grown to accommodate his transformed head, the bill of the cap shading a pair of round black eyes.\n\u201cDude, I don\u2019t feel so good,\u201d Lance said to Hal.\nHal was standing on the platform, tired but still recognizably human, his jeans and t-shirt still creased from the flight across the Pacific, even though he had been in Tokyo for weeks. With a pair of skinny legs and a crest of unkempt hair, he looked like a bird that had lost its plumage. His slender frame trembled in the stagnant August air as he stood on the platform\u2019s edge, looking over Lance\u2019s swollen belly.\n\u201cWhat the hell happened to you?\u201d Hal said.\nHe was used to seeing Lance in bad shape. They were neighbors at the end of the hall on the fourth floor of the Painted Dolphin boarding house. It was not unusual for Lance to pound on Hal\u2019s door at three o\u2019clock in the morning to rave about the drugs he had scored or the rounds of drinks he had scammed from American tourists looking for a guide to the local nightlife.\n\u201cI went too far, man,\u201d Lance said. \u201cWay too far.\u201d\nThe sound of his voice was both deeply soulful and sublimely artificial. It sounded as though a Yamaha synthesizer had been rigged up deep inside his belly, the keys being set off not by the pressure of tapping fingers but by the slow burn of stomach acid.\n\u201cIt was my research,\u201d Lance said. \u201cSomewhere between the time I did that analysis of the original Mothra vs. Godzilla and when I went looking for the exact street corner where Godzilla stepped on that pagoda in Destroy All Monsters, I started feeling strange, like something was changing inside me.\n\u201cI came knocking at your door last night, but you weren\u2019t in. You were probably out there searching for that missing girlfriend of yours. So I tried to take myself to the hospital. I started walking and I just kept feeling so damn hot, like my skin was going to melt off. I went into the metro station but I just couldn\u2019t get onto a train. Felt too cramped, too crowded. So I kept walking through the station until I wound up in this place. Next thing I know, here I am. I can\u2019t believe you found me.\u201d\n\u201cThe only reason I\u2019m here,\u201d Hal said, \u201cis because I thought I heard Linda\u2019s voice.\u201d\nLinda was why Hal had come to Tokyo, the reason he had put his life on hold back in the States. He had taken a month-long leave of absence from his position as an adjunct math professor to go looking for her after she disappeared. She\u2019d gone to Japan during a low point in their relationship, when all of their conversations devolved into fights about how much time she needed with her video games. How she didn\u2019t want to talk with Hal unless he was working a mission with her as a digital avatar in Sword City.\nShe had left for what was supposed to be a weeklong visit to what she called her spiritual homeland, her mecha Mecca: Electric Town, the neon-lit Tokyo neighborhood inundated with gaming shops and robot stores, candy-colored anime characters and corporate logos, where the streets were overrun by geeky otaku who had read every volume of Naruto and could tell you exactly where they were the first time they had watched the suicide scene from Ghost in the Shell.\nLinda had gone away two months ago and never returned.\n\u201cI could hear her voice,\u201d Hal said. \u201cI could hear through the subway gratings. I went down to the station and kept following the sound until I wound up here.\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll be damned,\u201d Lance said as he adjusted his tail. \u201cI can\u2019t believe she would come all the way down here. That would be ridiculous.\u201d\nHal watched Lance\u2019s nostrils flare slightly as a puff of white smoke emerged from each moist hole, the scent an unlikely blend of a petroleum and pot smoke.\n\u201cNo more ridiculous than anything else tonight,\u201d Hal said.\nHe was starting to feel like the whole world had disappeared, that there was nothing left but him and Lance in this tunnel. The rest of Tokyo was a ruined landscape of demolished buildings and cracked asphalt. Lance\u2019s transformation was nothing but a harbinger of other monsters that had been released as soon as Hal stepped through the turnstile.\n\u201cNothing makes sense anymore.\u201d\nLance was about to respond when a voice that was both distant and present whispered into Hal\u2019s ears. It brought to mind a disaffected singer in a filthy nightclub. Hal knew only one person who spoke this way.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Linda!\u201d\nHer voice was faint, indistinct, a wordless melody of aspiration and irritation, pleading and demanding all at once. The inchoate pattern repeated itself, calling into the stagnant air until it dissolved into the rumble of a thick gaseous burp passing through enormous yellow teeth.\n\u201cDude, I got bad news for you,\u201d Lance said. \u201cI think that voice was coming from inside me.\u201d\nHal squinted at the green jaws.\n\u201cDude, I think I swallowed her.\u201d\nHal spun away from Lance and balled his fists.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you did this,\u201d Hal said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you swallowed my girlfriend.\u201d\n\u201cSorry, man. You know it wasn\u2019t my intention.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it,\u201d Hal said. \u201cIt makes me feel a whole lot better to know that you didn\u2019t eat Linda on purpose.\u201d\nLance narrowed his black eyes and emitted another puff of smoke.\n\u201cLet\u2019s not get all snippy about this,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe if you\u2019d just moved in with your old lady like she wanted you to then none of this would have happened.\u201d\nHal sighed. He had to admit this was true. Six months ago, Linda had suggested cohabitation after a particularly successful dungeon crawl in Sword City. Her pale face was flushed with excitement when she suggested that maybe it was time to take their own personal game to a new challenge level. They had all the essentials: similar taste in take-out menus, a propensity to indulge each other\u2019s kinks. Surely they had all they needed to make a life together.\nHal demurred. At some level, he was terrified of a life that might interfere with his contemplation of abstract theories of Boolean algebras and propositional calculus. But instead of telling her that, instead of considering how he and Linda might possibly balance the equation, he harped on her gaming, he complained that she would never be able to make room for him in the crowded worlds of her digital universe.\nThey argued about it for weeks and then she was gone, disappearing across the International Date Line. Hal was not the only person who Linda had left in the dark. Her partner at the graphic design firm she ran complained that he was up to his ears in work but she left him no forwarding address. When Hal showed up at Linda\u2019s building to see if the landlord had any traces of her whereabouts, he found a new tenant moving furniture into her vacated apartment.\n\u201cI guess I blew it,\u201d Hal said.\nLance shook his head.\n\u201cNot worth thinking like that, man. It\u2019s like that scene in Son of Godzilla when those scientists should have fled the island when they saw that the radiation level was too high, but they waited too long and had to tangle with the giant insects.\u201d\nHal peered at the overhead lights.\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s exactly what this is like.\u201d\nLance tried to clasp Hal\u2019s shoulder with a three-fingered hand, but the motion gave him a headache. He burped again. Short bursts of flame escaped from his mouth. And once the fire dimmed, Linda\u2019s voice emerged again, the stark tone repeating itself like a metronome.\n\u201cCoin!\u201d Hal said. \u201cIt sounds like \u2018coin\u2019!\u201d\n\u201cShe wants you to add more coins,\u201d Lance said, \u201cKeep playing the game.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean she\u2019s still playing games in your stomach?\u201d\n\u201cDude, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve got inside me. All I know is that I was having the most weird-ass dreams, marching through Electric Town, swallowing everything in sight. Your girlfriend must have been in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d\nLance groaned at the thought of it. He\u2019d had the munchies before but nothing this extreme. His stomach ached from cracked glass, collapsed sheet rock and chewed-up metal girders. He moaned as Linda\u2019s plaintive whispers passed between his parted jaws.\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Hal said. \u201cHow does everything fit? You\u2019re not that big. How is Linda even alive inside of you?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been any serious research on kaiju digestive systems,\u201d Lance said. \u201cBut I have my theories.\u201d\n\u201cTheories?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain,\u201d Lance said, \u201cbut I\u2019ve always believed that somewhere inside of us there\u2019s some kind of interdimensional portal, some way of containing all that we swallowed, everything. Do you see what I\u2019m telling you?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\n\u201cThere are worlds inside of us,\u201d Lance said. \u201cEverything we swallow becomes a part of a whole new universe, slightly changed from the digestive acids, of course. An alternate reality that\u2019s just as real as anything we have out here. It\u2019s like the multiverse, man, just with monsters.\u201d\nHal propped a thumb against his chin.\n\u201cLance,\u201d he said, \u201cthat might just be the most fucked up thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d\n\u201cYou got to fill yourself with something, man.\u201d\nLance sighed. Laying motionless on the track, he looked like one of the dinosaurs Hal had wiped out with a laser gun in Linda\u2019s apartment, a blast fired from the Xbox controller to eliminate the T-rex that was charging his vehicle. He had started playing soon after Linda had broached the question of moving in together. Even Linda had to laugh at the spectacle of him absorbed in one of her games.\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what it takes to turn you into a gamer,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I brought up marriage, you could compete for the world championship.\u201d\nHal slew dozens of animated beasts that day as Linda sat beside him. Only when his vehicle plummeted over a waterfall and he was finally out of lives, did Hal look at Linda.\n\u201cI guess you\u2019d rather get more involved with dinosaurs than with me,\u201d she said.\nHal wanted to ask Linda how it felt getting a taste of her own digital medicine, but thought better of it. Although he kept seeing her for the next several weeks, something had changed. Everything from movie selections to dinner menus became a source of disagreement. Disagreements escalated into arguments and arguments devolved into shouting matches.\nThen there was the silence, long stretches with no talking, no texts, no pretext of communication. It was after three weeks of separation that Linda finally called Hal to announce that she had booked a flight to Japan.\n\u201cWhat happens if I go inside you?\u201d Hal said to Lance. \u201cWhat if I go inside to look for Linda? How do I know I won\u2019t get \u2014 digested?\u201d\n\u201cNo promises. We\u2019re talking about some seriously unexplored territory.\u201d\nThe deadpan melody of Linda\u2019s voice again emerged from Lance\u2019s throat.\n\u201cYou know what?\u201d Hal said. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s saying coin. I think she\u2019s saying join, join.\u201d\nLance gestured with his stubby hand as though he were brushing away a fly.\n\u201cSame difference.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t you figure it out? She wants you to go down there and be with her.\u201d\nHal ran a pale finger along his nose.\n\u201cYou might be right.\u201d\n\u201cGo ahead and take a look, man. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t bite.\u201d\nAs Lance opened his jaws, Hal considered the yellow tips of each incisor. He stared at those sharp teeth as the soft cries of Linda drifted through the station.\nThe air was a stale miasma of cannabis and Kirin beer when Hal finally peered inside Lance\u2019s mouth. He held onto one bicuspid for support as he leaned over a drooling tongue to get a clear view past the uvula. Traces of neon flashed across the surface of the esophagus, patches of green and violet light rising and falling across pink flesh.\n\u201cYou were right,\u201d Hal said when he pulled himself out from Lance\u2019s jaws and wiped the moisture from his face. \u201cYou\u2019ve got everything down there. More than I could ever imagine.\u201d\n\u201cNo wonder I don\u2019t feel so good.\u201d\n\u201cI want to go in deeper to get a better look,\u201d Hal said.\n\u201cGo for it.\u201d\n\u201cBut I want you to be careful,\u201d Hal said. \u201cIf you think you\u2019re going to cough or something, spit me out, will you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll try my best.\u201d\nUsing the bicuspid for support again, Hal worked his entire body into Lance\u2019s mouth, bracing his legs in the crook beside the right jawbone. Wrapping both hands beneath the purple surface of a forked tongue, Hal leaned under the uvula and peered directly down the alimentary canal.\nFollowing a trail of neon characters dripping down the digestive tract, Hal saw an entire neighborhood collapsed against the walls of Lance\u2019s stomach. As Lance himself had predicted, there was some sort of rupture of the time-space continuum, a warping of conventional perspective as Hal stared at the buildings Lance had swallowed.\nThe structures were at once inconceivably distant and impossibly close. Contained within Lance\u2019s belly was all that remained of Electric Town: a ramshackle pile of animated signs and brick buildings. A four-story gaming center rested diagonally against the side of an elevated railroad track. In the wash of search lights sweeping across the sunless sky, Hal could see unfazed throngs of otaku moving across the wreckage, the undigested swarm of gamers and geeks sweeping from one dilapidated robot store to the next.\nAnd then he could see Linda. She was stepping apart from the crowd, dressed in black jeans, a black t-shirt and black boots. Glancing up at Hal from a cracked sidewalk, Linda looked surprisingly unchanged: the face long and pale, the hair straight and black, the lips thin and slightly flushed, a single golden stud accenting an otherwise unremarkable nose.\nOnly the eyes were different. They had always seemed perfectly opaque to Hal, sleekly polished surfaces designed to reflect the landscapes behind digital windows. Now they had become transparent, revealing all that was unspoken in her soft repetitive calls.\n\u201cJoin,\u201d she said as she extended a hand up towards Hal. \u201cJoin me.\u201d\nThe tips of her fingers seemed so close that Hal could touch them. Still holding firm to one side of the purple tongue, Hal slipped his hand into the haze of Lance\u2019s gullet. He extended his reach deeper and deeper until he felt himself losing his grip.\n\u201cHey man,\u201d Lance said, careful not to move his jaws too rapidly as he spoke. \u201cAre you okay in there?\u201d\n\u201cNot exactly!\u201d\nHal was clinging to the uvula now as he planted his sneakers on the back of Lance\u2019s throat. He kept his eyes closed a moment as he recovered from the shock and then slowly looked back down.\nAll of the other pedestrians were gone now and Linda was alone on the sidewalk. She continued to reach through the neon haze until she saw that Hal, with both hands wrapped around the uvula, could not reach back. She lowered her arm and started walking toward a pachinko parlor still open for business.\nAs Hal watched her approach the threshold, he felt himself trembling in the chasm of Lance\u2019s mouth. Muscles tensed around the air duct and Hal could feel hot air rushing down the trachea.\n\u201cNo coughing!\u201d Hal shouted. \u201cPlease no coughing!\u201d\nLance heard the panicked voice and tried to do what he could to resist the growing urge that was building in his throat. He attempted to calm himself, breathing deliberately through his nostrils the way his meditation coach had once instructed him to do, back in the days before he was a monster.\nHal could feel the softening breaths as he watched Linda offer him one last glance before stepping through the sliding glass doors. Before he could register the expression on her face, Lance\u2019s mouth darkened with the shadows of three green fingers attempting to pull him out.\nTrembling claws extended beyond the tips of yellow teeth but it was already too late.\nHal had finally let go.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

(Photo: Death mask of unknown 19th century woman.)\nI died of fever and left my son when he was still a little boy. I had not wanted to die, but I cannot say that I had ever really cared about living.\nI remember that I was tired. My eyes raw as I lay in my bed, throat mangled from coughing. My husband\u2019s hand behind my head, the other pushed against my teeth, trying to get some water down. I locked my jaw and turned away.\nHis voice, pliant and supplicating, made me even more stubborn. Finally, he left me alone. I went to sleep and did not wake up.\nMy husband\u2019s house, small and meager, was one of many in our remote village cut off by humpbacked hills that formed a wall, keeping us from the outside. The village stretched out along the shoreline, nestled in the shadows of a bay. Our boats were tendrils in the water, angular noses pointed toward the shining sky.\nSea and sky stretched out in either direction like flat, blue mirrors. My husband did not want to bury me. He found a dark place in his home for my body. I laid hidden there for three days before my family found me.\nFuneral dirges echoed between the hills. My funeral was ordinary. Kin and guests gathered to cry out their grief. Gray-robed monks bowed their shorn heads over me, their left hands reaching for a clump of red dirt to spill over its edge. The hands of the guests, shielding their curious faces, whispered about my husband. My son, running alongside my coffin, cried as they carried me up the hill.\nYears before my death, I had married and settled quickly into the sagging bones of my life. After my marriage, I lived in my husband\u2019s home. I began in earnest to misplace my reason for living. It hid from me in the strange places of my husband\u2019s falling-apart house. My husband begged me for a son.\n\u201cWe do not have much,\u201d my husband had said before my son\u2019s birth, \u201ca child will fill our marriage with love.\u201d\nA child, I thought. I could not imagine him. In my mind, he had no face, no form. I felt nothing yet for the little son. I felt my husband\u2019s arms around me, like bands. I felt the tightness in my chest. I nodded, but could not speak of feelings I did not understand. My husband kissed my cheek, held me tightly against our marriage bed. I looked at the darkness and did not blink.\nMy funeral ended after the third day. I felt I had been adequately grieved over and settled down into sleep. But a shadow emerged from the slumbering seas, carried in alongside the hissing fog. My husband fell upon his knees above my grave. His great sobs rolled down towards the village, causing people to peek their heads outdoors. I wanted to scold him but held my tongue, refusing to acknowledge his humiliating display. Day after day, he came to me. Until one day the earth pitched and rolled, and I was pulled roughly along the depths of my husband\u2019s grieving. He tore open my coffin, took my body in his arms, my head rolling along my decaying neck, jaw gaping from broken sinews. The dirt and soil began to call for me, stinging and stuck like needles. He descended the hill to our little hut, laid me down upon my bed of bounded flat-reeds and silk coverings.\nI impatiently waited for my husband to speak to me for the first time since my death, to explain himself. He cupped my cheek with the palm of his hand, then fingered the silk of my shirt, his voice keeping rhythm with the movements of his hands upon my body.\n\u201cYou were always so beautiful,\u201d he said, \u201cyour hair gleaming. I could not sleep for days and days imagining you trapped in that place they kept you where you could not breathe.\u201d\nEven in life, he loved to praise me. First, about my beauty, then about his luck at having such an accomplished wife. Finally, he would praise my accomplishment in housekeeping. As if keeping that small house clean was a task worthy of praise. He would praise me often, and always in that order.\n\u201cHow do you let go of someone you loved best? It is not so easy for me as for others.\u201d\nHow I wished I could turn my head towards him then, to snap my eyes open and bring upon him a curse, give him something to truly whimper about. But the damage was done and I held onto my tongue. Burning anger like indigestion, bubbling and foaming with resentment.\nMy son came home from school at dusk and my husband went into the outer room to greet him. He walked to school by himself, now that I was no longer there to walk with him. I laid in the darkened room my family never disturbed me in. I was surrounded by the smell of my body like decaying apples, the leftover powders I had worn in life settled like hearth-ash about me. The smell of my family\u2019s dinner of oily fish and rice.\n\u201cDo not go into your mother\u2019s room, my son. I am preparing a gift for you. It will be a great surprise.\u201d\nMy son obeyed his father. He was a good son. I always thought his eyes were so much like mine. They looked, but all light would be absorbed into them, like two pinpricks that did not reflect anything back at the world. The words he spoke were soft, but strongly formed. In the morning my son left for the little blue school I hated walking him to each day. My husband brought home buckets of steel that clanged and scraped as he set them about the room. He sat beside me, beginning firstly to caress the sticky silk of my burial clothes. Then, there were soft sounds of churning as he kneaded what were in the buckets. He spoke and chattered to me, endlessly.\n\u201cI thought I was specifically blessed, that the gods had chosen for me such a beautiful wife. But they took you from me. Such a simple mistake and you were buried where I could not see your face. Gods make mistakes sometimes. I believe that it can be possible.\u201d\nHe had begun work on a tomb for me, a prison molded into the shape of my body, molding wet plaster into my delicate skin, trying not to peel it apart. I did not know from where he could possibly acquire the plaster. He never gave me any indication in life of skills outside of his dull work. He had always been a weak man, more like the hidden, slippery fish he caught each day, than the man who catches them. I spent many weeks unmoving, undying, overwhelmed by the sensations of life. The plaster, made of a lime and sand mixture used to cover the walls, now hardened over me. I could not bear the feeling of plaster squeezing, pulling the deep layers of my skin from its moorings of muscle and bone.\n\u201cStop!\u201d I demanded.\nHe paused in his work, but then began again as if he couldn\u2019t hear me. I bristled with anger.\n\u201cStop ignoring me.\u201d\nMy husband heaved his face close to my own for a moment and then pulled back, mumbling into his hands as he went about his work.\n\u201cThey took you from me.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve disobeyed our traditions by keeping me where I should not be kept.\u201d I said.\n\u201cMy sweet wife. You are dead. Gone from me,\u201d he mused aloud to himself.\nAgain he refused to respond to my anger. When he tired, he brushed my hair until it gleamed to his liking. Each night he slept the deep, laborious sleep of a peasant as my new tomb hardened over me. Some days, when he was feeling more melancholic, he would rummage through all of my clothes that had been folded into bags once I had died, and laid them out. He lingered over the ones he liked seeing me wear best or ones he had given to me as gifts, describing them in detail.\n\u201cOur son misses you,\u201d my husband said. \u201cHe was a quiet child before, but now he rarely speaks.\u201d\n\u201cI am dead. I have no more tears for him.\u201d\nMy husband began to cry.\n\u201cTake care of our son,\u201d I cooed, trying to soothe. \u201cYou are the only one left. Bury me. Forget about me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve made you a gift.\u201d\nGently, he laid a mask of ceramic plaster over my face.\n\u201cI\u2019ve painted dark eyes. The lids curve like birds\u2019 wings and your lips, I\u2019ve painted into budding blossoms.\u201d\nHe pushed the mask down, my head sank deeper into the silk bedding. I could not move and my husband could choose to hear my words or not. I could not show my displeasure. He worked like a water-buffalo, doggedly ignoring my protests in favor of his own suffering, pleading with me to be joyful of where I am now. His ears seemed to have solidified into wood, sound unable to penetrate his thick, water-buffalo\u2019s skull. At long last, the tomb was finished and he slept beside me.\n***\nEvenings were cold and misty. In the night, I found solace when the rain chased up the mustiness of the dirt so that I could almost feel it, through the impenetrability of my tomb. Boats on the water rocked, lanterns clanging against the wind. My bedroom door opened and my husband spoke.\n\u201cSon, look in and see who is lying on that bed. Your mother has come back to us.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like mother,\u201d my son said.\n\u201cShe is just different now. She has to sleep in her special place, but she won\u2019t ever leave us again.\u201d\nThere were the sounds of soft footsteps. My son approached me, gently wrapped his arms around me, and laid his head upon my breast. I felt the squeeze, my tomb pressing down on my skin from his weight. He trembled and began to cry. I listened and did not speak. Eventually he quieted and hugged my tomb to sleep, his small thin legs dangled over it, his hand curled over my plaster heart.\nI remembered back to a time when my son was newly born. I had often sat at the window of my room, looking out at the rain. I would quiet him this way whenever he cried. But one night, he wouldn\u2019t stop crying no matter how I bounced him, cooing and tsk-tsking. Then I sat unmoving with him sprawled over my lap, his belly kneaded against the bone of my thighs. He squirmed like a molted insect, soft and pink. He squealed until his face was red. He stopped crying when someone came \u2014 his father perhaps or an aunt \u2014 and took him from me.\nI remembered unbearable summers when the children whined. They were constantly bathed to cool down. My son stood in our small bathing room, I sat before him on my haunches, sweat mingling with the dampness, settling between my breasts. I soothed his skin with a tattered, rough towel, pulling downward on his arms like slicing the skin off a carrot. Often he would glance at me unblinking, dark eyes watching me as I bathed him, before directing his attention to some corner of the room. But always those eyes returned their gaze to me.\n***\nThe rain poured tinny against our roof. The fish trembled in the water and the trees drowned in it. Our village prepared for a storm while I lived on in my crypt. They were used to having me in the house again. Despite my protests and shrill anger, my husband had reshaped our family. At first my son had wanted to be obedient, to sleep beside his mother, but he began to sleep with me less and less each night. The rain inflamed his need to warm his bones and he wandered. He walked further from home until, one night, he did not come back. My husband went out into the thundering rain to search for him. It was not until daylight that I heard him again. My husband made him promise to be discreet.\n\u201cThey do not know about her,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d I thought sourly.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll take her away. They\u2019ll take you away.\u201d\nBut my son kept wandering, and I could not bring myself to say anything.\n***\nAt the height of our storm, my son brought me a bowl. It was a small bowl that made a light clack on our tiled floor when he set it beside my head. It was so close to me\u2014the dirt in the bowl, almost at my fingertips. If only I had a little more strength, I could feel myself reaching out, plunging my fingers into its deep richness, pouring it all in my mouth and swallowing. I wanted to thank my son, grateful for this small kindness. A moment of soothing peace.\nThen, the unbearable tranquility of my life was disrupted by an angry thudding at our door. Behind my son, I heard voices that towered over the the roiling vortex. I instantly recognized my brother\u2019s voice. His accusatory tone rising above the chorus. The voices barged in, added to the noise of the storm, and descended ruthlessly upon my husband.\n\u2014 What madness!\n\u2014 It is sickness\n\u2014 It will infect everyone\n\u2014 Bad blood, it will spoil\n\u2014 Do you hear the heavens howl and scream?\n\u2014 How do you bury the one you loved best? How?\nMy husband threw himself upon my body. I felt the weight of him touching whatever part of me he could touch, kneaded and grasped. The wind shook the sides of our house. The lashing rain and whirling wind shifted from one wall of the house to batter the opposite, never allowing itself to stop and rest. We were like captured birds in its path. My husband\u2019s grief rolled amongst the crowd, fragmenting their anger, beat back against it. But, in a mob, the villagers fell upon my husband, spilling the dirt from my bowl at their feet.\n\u2014 Everything has its place\n\u2014 Your place is on the water\n\u2014 Your son\u2019s place is at home\n\u2014 Not wandering around like an orphan out on those hills and the boats!\n\u2014 Your wife\u2019s place is buried under that hill\n\u2014 That\u2019s where she must be\u2026\nThey roughly detached my plaster cast from my bed, brought me outside into the rain again where I could smell the earth. They made a pyre for me out of wet wood. Ignited a fire as the rain fell and the flames danced to meet it in the air. They gathered like ants around an offering, chanting faster and faster, pleading with the gods to release my spirit, to take me from my mortal body. I thought I must have screamed from the pain but it was my husband wailing \u2014 forgive me!\nYes, I sighed, as higher and higher the fire burnt. The release came and freed a vision to come into the purple sky\u2014my son walking a path alone. I thought I had no more tears for him, but now a stillness inside me stirred. I cried out for the little figure, wandering where I could not join him \u2014 on cracked concrete and in mud \u2014 looking for the sharp warmth of my hand in his, under the open sky.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

There is also cold, and the slithering company of eels, and there is waiting: time stretching out until it\u2019s lost its meaning.\nI have lived in the lake for so long that I do not mind the dark, nor the cold, nor the eels.\nThe waiting, or rather, the dread of what will come, is harder to bear.\nI stroke my treasure. I am aware that one day, perhaps one day soon, I must give it up. The thought sickens me.\nOnce, I was an ordinary girl \u2014 bright-eyed and untamed. Overwhelmed by the crowd and craving the sweetness of apples, I slipped away from a village festival.\nI was known for it: Niviene, adept at escaping the protection of her brothers; Niviene who kept her own company. Aloof. Alone. Then, as now.\nI remember the crisp bite of apples, the scent of summer hay and wildflowers. I remember laughing, plaiting cascades of blossoms into my hair, humming a tune meant for dancing as bare feet recalled the steps along the dusty road.\nLife was light and heat and joy.\nThere is no dancing below, no food to slake hunger, no beauty to covet. My hair has become blossoming algae, my skin the pale silver of the belly of a fish. The dress I wore is long gone, rent to rags and waterlogged streamers.\nI look almost like the nymph who imprisoned me.\nShe was not always my jailer; first, she\u2019d been my savior.\nI\u2019d been snared, a hapless rabbit. They left me to die when they finished with me \u2014 tossed into the lake either to drown or bleed.\nI, tangled in torn skirts and too weak to fight, sank into the murk, and when she came to me I thought I must be dreaming, so near death that reality had lost its design.\n\u201cShall I help you?\u201d she\u2019d asked, her voice the rasp of a whetstone on an iron blade.\nI did not answer, too tired to be concerned about what could and could not be real.\nShe pushed my hair from my face, her webbed fingers tipped with blunt, dark talons.\n\u201cYou are so young. Surely you have no wish to die?\u201d\nShe pulled me to the surface then, and I took a nourishing, gasping breath.\n\u201cShall I help you?\u201d she asked again.\nHer face in the twilight terrified me, and I could not answer. She stared hard, waiting, and then abandoned me to sink once more to the depths.\nLong hours later \u2014 or merely moments, I could not tell \u00b1 she returned, pulling me back to the world above. I choked and coughed and breathed the glorious air.\nThis time, she clutched the hilt of a sword, its bejeweled pommel burnished by fading sunlight.\nWhile I devoured apple-scented air, she explained her terms \u2014 her charge would be passed to me. I would wait, and when the right one came, I would bestow the sword.\n\u201cThat is all?\u201d I asked, when I could once more speak. It seemed so little in trade for my life, and I had been warned against making deals with the fair folk. I touched the shining hilt. \u201cHow will I know the right one?\u201d\nHer eyes were black, unblinking. \u201cYou will know.\u201d\nIn her strange accent, she explained.\nOnce this mysterious someone came to claim it, my task was to wait again, for the sword\u2019s return. I knew I would not. I thought I would leave as soon as it was gone, possibly before, for what was this creature\u2019s duty to me?\nI agreed, and it was done. I would live. I would live, breathing water as air in the company of eels and fishes.\nAlready I felt my body mend, my mind turning from the world above to my shining charge below.\n\u201cAnd when the task is done?\u201d I cried, but she was already gone, a flash of scale and fin.\nI thought it would be easy. A short wait, a meaningless task. But the sword is not as I expected.\nThe sword is lovely.\nIt is warm to the touch, seeming to thrum with living energy. Each time I tried to leave, it called me back. It whispered its name, naming me, too. Binding me to it.\nOn those rare days when the sun truly shines, the light filters through the dense blooms of algae, bleeding green and gold into the depths of my lake. The sunlight catches the jeweled hilt of my sword \u2014 half-mired in the muck and yet a beacon when touched by sun.\nIt does not rust nor tarnish; the silver gleams year after year as though newly made, the precious stones never dull.\nMy hands reach for it often, sliding it from its sheath of mud and pebbles. I trace the pattern etched on the cross-guard and wonder if it\u2019s meant to convey meaning or just add beauty.\nMy fingers feel small, wrapped around the grip, and even underwater, it is so heavy.\nI am careful with the blade, having learned years before that it keeps its edge. The sword is magic. It has become my treasure.\nAnd yet, one day, I must relinquish it.\nAt first I watched the people above, longing for the life I\u2019d abandoned. Time blunted my interest, and now full seasons, years perhaps, can pass between visits to the surface.\nThere were those, long gone now, who I wished to see again \u2014 my mother, my brothers, the girl who used to play with me in the meadow \u2014 but even they cross my mind but rarely.\nLonging fades to curiosity, and even that fades, until my whole world is just the humming vitality of the sword.\nI imagine keeping it, ignoring the call when it comes. Perhaps it will not. So many years \u2014 centuries? \u00b1 have passed, after all.\nSurely the sword has been forgotten by all but me? Surely it is mine to keep. Mine to cherish.\nThe sword thrums mightily now, almost keening. I wrap myself around it, trying to soothe, jealously trying to muffle its call. I suspect the truth, that the time has come.\nYou will know. The nymph\u2019s words come back, undimmed in memory.\nI sheathe it in mire, swim to the surface.\nThey still pull carts down the shore road, still drop eel nets of nettle-hemp from their boats. Life goes on, unchanged, it seems, even after so very long.\nNear dusk, I peek out at them from among the reeds and sedge-grass. I see men toiling in the fields, even at this late hour. They sing songs with strange words, their melodies echoes of tunes I once knew.\nA knight rides by, his horse bedecked in colorful livery. I sigh, relieved, as he passes. He is not the one.\nI sleep, or what passes for sleep now, and come awake with a start. The gibbous moon is high overhead, its reflection an imperfect circle on the still surface of my lake. I sink low, backing further into the cluster of reeds.\nThere are men on my pebbly shore.\nThey are few, all knights by their glorious raiment. Each removes his helmet and one \u2014 his white surcoat emblazoned with a silver-threaded cross \u2014 kneels at the waterline. For a moment, all is silent, and I realize they must be praying.\nKeeping to the shadows, I swim closer. I would see more of this man who means to steal my treasure.\nA ripple spreads across the lake as though a stone were tossed \u2014 my sword, I realize, its keening growing more powerful.\nHe looks out over the water, an awestruck expression on his young, careworn face.\nI freeze, startled: He hears it, or feels it. He knows my sword is down there, calling him.\nHe stands, straightens his spine into a regal stance.\n\u201cI am Arthur!\u201d he calls across the dark lake. \u201cKing of the Britons! I have come to beg of you use of the sword Excalibur.\u201d\nBeg of me? Such humility in the voice of a king moves something deep in my soul. The sword thrums again in answer.\nThe moment has come, and I am paralyzed by it. Excalibur is mine! I would scream it into the night, gather my treasure into my arms and carry it off.\nAnd yet, Excalibur has decided. My own desire is naught.\nHe will return it. The nymph said as much, that this man wishes a loan, nothing more. His own words convey this, and yet I do not trust.\nHe will come to love the sword as much as I have. It captivates. A king is yet a man, and men fall easily to greed. He will spirit it away, keep it for himself. He will not be able to help it, once he touches it, knows it.\nThe sword keens once more, its voice nearly a wail of longing now. It yearns for this Arthur. A man\u2019s life is brief, a part of me argues. A king\u2019s even more so. I can wait \u2014 I have proved this \u2014 I can outlast this king.\n\u201cHow have you come to know of Excalibur?\u201d My voice rings across the black water, its power surprising even myself. The men on the shore fall back, crossing themselves in fear. Arthur does not.\nHe steps forward, his boots splashing into the water.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he says softly. \u201cYour sword is my destiny. My last hope. My kingdom\u2019s last hope. The seer Merlin foretold it.\u201d\nHe cannot see me, so his eyes scan the whole of the lake.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he says again \u2014 the plea of a man, not a monarch.\nIt is a wonder, my Excalibur. I believe it can change a man\u2019s destiny. A kingdom\u2019s destiny. I stare into this king\u2019s face, searching for any trace of guile. I find none. He is in earnest.\nI dive.\nThe sword has shaken itself nearly free of its muddy scabbard, and I cradle it one last time before surging back to the surface. Arthur does not alarm me, but I cannot trust his men.\nAfraid to be seen, I keep below, slicing the surface of the lake with the blade.\nI hold it there, willing my wrist not to tremble, until I hear Arthur\u2019s splashing footsteps, until I feel the startling warmth of his hand lifting Excalibur\u2019s hilt from my small fingers.\n\u201cI am beholden to you, my Lady of the Lake,\u201d Arthur murmurs, bowing deeply, blocking the moon\u2019s glow.\nI sink back into the darkness, the cold, the waiting. I dreamt this moment would grant me freedom \u2014 but no.\nIt is a short span, the life of a king.\nAnd so I wait.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

You\u2019re alive!\nI\u2019m only kidding, kind of.\nI for real think it\u2019s cool that if you\u2019re reading this, it most likely means you are human and that planet Earth is still inhabited \u2014 but it also means that this whole thing about me dissolving into space with a funny (albeit bodiless) being is some bullshit.\nAlthough, I must say I have probably done more insane and moronic things for love. Like this one time I purposefully slipped on some ice as a means to get my boyfriend to stop talking to my roommate, or more specifically her breasts, so he would pay attention to the physical manifestation of my existential suffering and insatiable lovesickness, but instead of falling gracefully, I slid off the sidewalk into oncoming traffic, causing an accident where an elderly man broke his nose and a skunk died from tire burn. I will never get the image of that flat white line of fur on the cement out of my head.\nWhat I\u2019m saying is, you\u2019re probably a stronger woman than me, which is why you\u2019re alive and I am now preparing myself to disappear into the great unknown.\nYou are a woman, right? In my opinion (not to be sexist lol), no man could survive alone like this for more than like a second. If you\u2019re at all like me, your breasts are gone now and your crotch resembles that of one of those creepy Victorian dolls whose eyes seem really fucking real.\nI hope you\u2019re also experiencing the freedom of whatever insanity has caused me to turn into this newly sexless being. I can finally be a person who\u2019s not expected to be anything in particular or think about things in a certain way just because of my formerly amazing, sponge-like anatomy.\nI guess it also helps that literally no one else is around. As Jean-Paul Sartre once said, \u201cOther people are dicks,\u201d or something like that.\nExcept for Sob, of course. If it wasn\u2019t for Sob, everything would be different.\nFirst, a caveat, if you\u2019re reading this for real and you\u2019re alone and actually really freaked out and lonely, or if you\u2019re reading this and are surrounded by some sort of human-like species, but you\u2019re still really lonely, I hope you find your Sob because if there\u2019s ever been or ever will be a God, they (Sob is genderless, says the Book of Sob) are, or are like, Sob.\n# # #\nThe day I wake up as the last woman on Earth, it is Sob who convinces me I\u2019m not crazy.\nImagine me waking up in my shitty apartment as usual, first noticing that my cat is gone, and then that some motherfucker took all my knickknacks and furniture and stripped me naked. And (this is embarrassing) it takes me at least five more minutes to realize my breasts and vulva are also nowhere to be found, because I\u2019m really preoccupied with trying to find my French press and coffee before I deal with whatever fucked up universe I\u2019ve found myself in.\nHere are the things I first notice: my bright white walls once covered in photos are now bare, the carpet is torn up, showing the shitty hardwood floors, my doorknob gone, the windows sealed shut. Outside my window, at first glance, all appears to be normal, before I notice that not even the leaves on the trees are moving.\nSuddenly, I feel very alone and frightened. I wonder if even the wind has deserted me. Clawing at my chest for my breasts, I sit on the floor and rock myself back and forth, wondering what I should do next when the thought occurs to me \u2014 I may never get to watch Catfish, RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, or Chopped again.\nI don\u2019t know how much time passes before I fall asleep there on the hardwood floor and later wake to the sound of a telephone ringing, the same sound I remember from the landline in my grandmother\u2019s home when I was a child, circa 1992, in case that\u2019s helpful for you. I search the entirety of my now-empty apartment, the ringing never ceasing until I find, back in the living room, a tiny white cell phone, the screen as large as my palm, in the middle of the floor. I walk towards it hesitantly and as soon as I reach its halo, the ringing stops. I stand still without reaching for it.\nDING! A message appears on the screen. I bend over to read it. Hello! You are the last woman on Earth. Congratulations. Love, Sob.\nI pick up the phone and examine it. I hold it against my face: \u201cHello? Hello? Hello?\u201d\nI try to make a call, but there\u2019s nothing on the screen except Sob\u2019s message and a keyboard.\nWho are you? I type, then send.\nYour new friend, Sob replies immediately.\nWhere the fuck are my real friends? I say. There is a long moment in which I wonder if I\u2019ve been too rude and Sob\u2019s abandoned me.\nDING!\nWhat friends? Sob\u2019s also sent an emoji: A smiley face, baring its teeth exuberantly while also crying, stares back at me.\nI want to ask who the fuck Sob is again, but instead I say I\u2019m crying even though I\u2019m not because it feels like I should be, and I\u2019m hoping Sob will give me more information if they sympathize with me.\nYou\u2019re not crying, Sob says. Then, Ecosystem rules: part is as great and necessary as the whole.\nWhat the fuck does that mean? I text back. When they don\u2019t respond, I ask a moment later: Where am I?\nSob texts back lol with a gun, American flag, bag of money, and flames before the phone goes dark, my only line of communication now gone. I\u2019m fine until I find myself running around the apartment in circles while crying, occasionally jumping up and down. There is nothing to do but cry, sleep, or run into walls. I listen to my body for any sign of hunger, but there\u2019s none.\nWhat have I become?\n# # #\nThe next day, I find the phone on the kitchen counter, already ringing. The screen reads Calling Sob ... I put the phone to my ear. All I can hear is The Jetsons theme song. I hang up, then text Sob: Funny.\nIsn\u2019t this what you thought The Future would be? Sob sends me a winky face and a rocket.\nHow do I know you\u2019re telling the truth? I say. There could be a million women locked up in rooms at your mercy.\nSigh, Sob says then sends me a lightning bolt.\nJust another day at the Patriarch Factory, I type. I throw the phone at the window, at the unmoving trees, but it doesn\u2019t make a sound. The window and phone are fine. When I check the last message, it reads, Have you not noticed your newly neutered state? Kissy face, rainbow, XY, COOL.\n# # #\nOnce I was a little girl like you with a kind father and a mother who was a terror. When I was thirteen, my father began entering my room at night when I was in bed with a book.\nFather? I said, closing my book. We were very formal with each other.\nDaughter, he said, resting his hand upon mine on top of my book.\nFather sat next to me on my yellow-striped comforter, crossing his legs at his ankles, avoiding a glimpse of the boy band images plastered on my walls. He read Bible verses to me every night and I never knew what to say, so I didn\u2019t say. When I tried, Father would say, Shhh, and slowly move his hand over my mouth until I relaxed. Most nights I stared ahead at the shadows of trees outside my bedroom window, counting my school crushes in my head as Father orated, his big lips moving over his small teeth, his eyes wide and bright with conviction.\nMy father was a born-again, became a born-again once we realized my mother was crazy, skating around our small house in her thin cotton nightgown all day long, mumbling about how the bad men were after her. Once she broke my father\u2019s nose thinking he was a bad man about to get her for good. I watched him pin her to the ground then sit on top of her.\n\u201cDarling, please dial 911,\u201d he told me. So I did, and she went away, only to meet more bad men.\nSob, please tell me: are you a bad man? Are you going to get me for good?\n# # #\nEventually, after what may be a long time or no time at all, I ask Sob if there\u2019s a way to make me feel loved like I\u2019ve always wanted to feel loved. Sob says the love of Sob is always there if I open my heart to it. I lie my naked body on the kitchen tile and feel its coolness against my skin. Sob texts, Do you feel it? I tell Sob I feel nothing but then I do. A warmth covers me and I no longer feel naked. I no longer feel of a body. I am a cloud. I am a balloon. I am a dream. I lie like that until I fall asleep, wondering if I\u2019ll ever wake again, if I even care.\nWhen I wake, I text Sob, That shit was better than any of the weed I\u2019ve had in my life. Sob sends me hands clapping.\n# # #\nYou can call Sob Sobby or Sobbers or Sobling, or my favorite, S.O.B. I like to call Sob that last one because it always makes them send me the strangest string of emojis that cause me to laugh or cry. Sob has a poetic sensibility in that way.\nOften, at the start of the day, I text, Sob? Sometimes I try it in a Wisconsin accent, in case Sob might find it funny. Sahb? I hear a laugh echo, gurgle, burp\u2014like how I imagine a human heart would sound if it could laugh.\nLate at night, I sing the National Anthem to Sob then tell them to fuck off. I walk towards a wall with precise steps, slam my head against it, hoping the plaster is backed by bricks, until I can feel and see nothing at all. I want to get back to the lightness of the kitchen floor, but I don\u2019t know how to do it without Sob by my side. When I wake to the unending white of the ceiling above me, I touch my forehead. I\u2019m fine. I curl into a corner once again.\n# # #\nOne morning I wake to the sound of a very deep voice: \u201cHello.\u201d Hazy light streams in from the windows and lands in patches against the hardwood floor. I\u2019m cold and scared when I open my eyes. I move a few inches so a path of light covers my feet. When I turn my head, I see a fat tabby cat perched on a milk crate across the room. I scream. My cat purrs. My cat who disappeared and can now talk. I cover my face with my hands and weep. I tell Gertrude Stein I just want to go home. When I emerge from the cover of my arms, Gertrude is sitting closer, staring at me with bright green eyes, a scar across her left brow that wasn\u2019t there before.\n\u201cNow is not the time for tears,\u201d Gertrude bellows. \u201cI am here to help.\u201d\n\u201cWho sent you?\u201d I say.\nGertrude comes closer, pushing her soft head into my calf. I can\u2019t help but feel a warmth rise inside of me in response to her touch, her animal heat. I pet, then nuzzle my head against her neck.\n\u201cCan we cuddle for a bit?\u201d I say.\nI have never felt more pathetic.\nThank you, I text Sob.\nSob sends me a thumbs-up.\n# # #\nOnce, I was in a mental hospital for juveniles, but not for what you\u2019d think. I\u2019m not like my mother. I\u2019m not schizophrenic or even depressed. I just couldn\u2019t speak.\nI would try. I\u2019d feel the movement of my jaw. I\u2019d try so hard to emit noise that I\u2019d choke and cry. Father prayed for me every night, and when doctors couldn\u2019t find anything physically wrong with me, he prayed for me some more.\nUnable to speak, I asked for help by writing Father letters every day, leaving them for him on his desk in his study. At night, he responded to me when he visited me in bed, perched next to me while I lay trapped under the covers, saying aloud that he knew I was scared. It was so hard without Mother around, he knew. He told me that, eventually, my voice would come back. Then, he would read Bible verses aloud to me, resting his hand on my head.\n\u201cI am praying for you, sweet girl,\u201d he\u2019d say before kissing me goodnight on the forehead.\nThen one day I walked into Father\u2019s study. He was reading the Bible at his desk with only a dimly lit lamp lighting the text. His glasses sat low on his nose. I brandished a knife in my right hand. Then, I slit my forearm open in front of him. When my body went to scream, it didn\u2019t make a sound. Father ran to me, his eyes huge as he cried, \u201cOh sweet girl, what did you do?\u201d \u2014 looking at me as though I was Little Bo-Peep who lost her sheep.\nAt the mental hospital for juveniles, I met a girl who called herself Bertha who only ate oranges. She had creamy tan skin, bright blue eyes, and curly black hair. She spoke to me in Spanish exclusively, which was fine with me because I liked to learn, and I think she liked that I couldn\u2019t talk back. After five days together, I figured out the phrase she said most often. I loved him, she said. I loved him so much it hurt.\nI wished I could tell her I thought she was brave for loving someone like that. I wasn\u2019t sure if I ever could. Instead, when I understood her, I held out my hand with my palm up. She put her hand in mine. We looked at each other.\nWhen Bertha finished eating an orange, she\u2019d save the rind for me. She\u2019d find me, sit me down next to her, then rub the inside of the peel on my fingernails because it was good for them. By the time I left the mental hospital for juveniles, I could say one thing.\n\u201cGracias,\u201d I said to Bertha before I left.\nShe kissed the side of my neck.\n# # #\nGertrude and I devised a plan, which is why you\u2019re able to read this at all. I don\u2019t know how time passes in this room, but it feels like we\u2019ve been writing for years with her claws, scratching one letter into the wall at a time. Sob texts me, Nice work, but I don\u2019t respond because Gertrude\u2019s cradled in my arm, my hand wrapped around her paw, nails protruding, as we get to this part of the story.\nThis is right now, where I say goodbye. I will set Gertrude down to text Sob that we\u2019re almost done with the story. I want to tell them that I\u2019d like them to take me away, to somewhere else, anywhere where I can no longer be of a body.\nBut now I can\u2019t find my phone in the room, no matter how I crawl, grasp at the walls, dig at the floor.\nThen, the door opens. It is Sob. I know it immediately, though I see nothing. I only feel a light energy move through the room. Sob moves towards me, and suddenly, there is a never-ending rainbow of light, shimmering.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done so good here on Earth,\u201d Sob says.\nMy whole body, it cries and smiles as I write this, as quickly as I can, with Gertrude in my arms. Sob\u2019s voice is light and warm, nothing but sweetness.\n\u201cYou\u2019re ready now.\u201d Sob is smiling. They tell me to take my time. There\u2019s no rush to where we\u2019re going.\nI can feel it. I know what I will need to do next. First, I will set Gertrude down, say goodbye one last time, take a breath.\nThen, I will walk, moving deeper into the rainbow with every step I take until I am floating, letting my body dissolve into what it\u2019s always been: warm, bright light.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

It\u2019s surrounded by little bones, the kind of things he just feels wrong about leaving behind.\nHe\u2019s funny that way; he feels attached to the dead, even the ones he never knew.\nThe burned husks of the Ford and the Volkswagen sit side by side in the fenced in lot behind his house next to the building where he parks his two tow trucks.\nAll four parents of the newlywed couple in the van come down from Canada after the accident to claim their dead. They come with a Lakota FBI agent named Slim. His job is to tie up the loose ends from the triple fatality accident on federal land. His tan Frye boots are red from the dust and the mud of the western end of the Navajo Reservation.\nNobody came the 30 miles into town from Leupp to look at the Ford truck.\nThe parents hoped to find their kid\u2019s wedding rings, maybe hidden under the dashboard of the Volkswagen above the package tray.\nThere was no space to search. The whole front of the van was crushed inward and folded up on itself where it buckled on impact with the Ford truck.\nAll the plastic and the seats were burned away.\nBaca uses the big winches on the back of his wrecker to unfold the burned and flattened sheet metal that was once the nose of the camper van.\nThe parents from Canada search; Baca and Slim look on in awkward silence.

I\u2019m writing this just as I have been stirred to waking by the most mysterious yet magnificent of dreams. Something tells me that I must pen it to paper immediately. It will be rooted within words that way.\nMy memory has been a fickle vine lately. It grips onto surfaces at random; If I cannot trust my own memory, I can at least be assured by the fact that yours will not fail. Your letters will come soaring through the skies to calm me, that I know and trust. Your penmanship, etched with such grace and sophistication, is something I cannot un-remember. Even till the end of time, when all of its granules have run out, my memory will still cling to your writings, your words.\nNow, where was I? Oh yes, this dream \u2014 this visitation. Yes, there was someone in this dream, apart from myself. They came to me in a robe of wisteria petals, surrounded by pink and purple butterflies.\nWho are you, I had asked.\nThey replied in a voice that was so rich, it was as if a river of silk had flowed forth to caress my toes and the spaces in between them.\nI apologize for such an unconventional call; you must understand that circumstances only allow for such visitations between Fae and human.\nThere was a moment of silence \u2014 at least in that timeless dreamscape it felt like a moment \u2014 before they continued: What is it that you desire the most?\nYou were there in an instant. It was longing pulled from the tides of memory. It was a construction \u2014 so real and yet so surreal \u2014 pieced together from the correspondence we shared, built from that tiny photograph you had sent me many seasons ago. It was how I imagined you had grown since then. How I saw you: Your arms wrapped around my waist. I felt warmth and tenderness that was fleeting yet forever.\nThe Fae smiled, if they could smile.\nSo this is your desire. Remember this: under a full moon, a thousand silver cranes will reveal your destiny. However, a word must never leave your lips until the deed is done. Only then, what you so wish for will come true.\nI gasped as an amethyst lake of butterflies enveloped us. You fizzled into a lilac cloud of mist. The Fae started to ascend, drifting away into light that obfuscated their features. The last thing I remembered before falling into the plasm of darkness was the sweet smell of wisteria blooms.\nWhat do you make of this dream? Do you believe in destiny, Seori? Perhaps I do. Life seems to always be more than just a sequence of mere coincidences.\nSeori, tell me. What should I do? My heart wants me to believe. My heart wishes to fold a thousand cranes just to see you.\nWith well wishes,\nRuri of House Sesongnam\n***\nMy sweet summer Seori,\nIt has been days since you wrote back, and I am deeply sorry that I could not get back to you as soon as I wished. A great ill has befallen me since I had gone out of my room for the first time this fall. I had intended to go to the nearest market, or I heard from my neighbours and visiting relatives that there was a merchant who stocked the specific paper I sought.\nTrue to their word, the shop had sheets upon sheets of opalescent silver that thin they made my veins look like the thick branches of a willow tree. I had pulled all my squirreled savings when the merchant confided that I was the very first person to request such paper. Since I was purchasing the entire spool of silver, he charged me a price much lower than what I had expected.\nThink of it as a gift, he pleaded, and as a favor.\nI promised him so and left with a cart stocked to the brim.\nAlthough they appeared like steel, the silver sheets were feather-light. As I made my way through the marketplace, I could sense everyone\u2019s eyes on my purchase. What could I possibly be doing with that much paper \u2014 in that color? It was at my very own doorstep, however, that I suddenly felt the earth pulling me like a lodestone to the north. The sky started to spin like azure yarn unspooling.\nWhen I came to, the family\u2019s physician said it was vertigo. I must have overexerted myself in the marketplace. What was I doing making such a bulk purchase? (I was too tired to bring up that the silver sheets weighed nothing at all.) Perhaps I was not accustomed to the autumnal air. They did observe that this year had an unusual change in temperature. I was not to leave the house at all until I had recovered fully. No \u2014 I was not to leave my room at all.\nThat did not faze me, considering that my first objective had been achieved.\nNow these sheets of silver lay in my room. In the past two days, before the drafting of this letter, I started the process of folding. Although my body was weak and often confined to the bed, my fingers and eyes could still function. The hours lost me until I realized that I ought to have written to you. You perhaps might be wondering.\nFrom a rough estimation, I think I have folded about two hundred and sixty or so cranes. My hands are quite the sight for these efforts; they are faintly peppered with cuts. The paper is so fine that it could easily poke one\u2019s eye out if they are not careful.\nCaressing and addressing each crease and each fold into wing-tip and tail has been quite a process \u2014 an art form that relies on exactitude and crispness. It appears tedious, but I believe the experience to be a complete opposite of monotony! The intricate lattices of lines give rise to something quite dazzling. Sometimes I feel like my mind is growing stronger as I fold and fold. I start to remember things as if they were like stained glass to the windows of my mind; crystallised and painted in the most vibrant hues.\nI think of you the most. You are all I ever think about.\nMany folds away,\nRuri\n***\nTo Seori who has my heart,\nI know you must be full of worry and anger. My dear, you are at liberty to chide me. You might have even assumed some sort of burden for my state of illness.\nYou have no fault to account for. It was my choice to go out to the marketplace. It was my plan to fold the paper cranes. No matter how many cuts start to appear on my palms. No matter if the lids of my eyes start to waver against fatigue like ingots of lead. I decided to do it. Even if it kills me. Yes, even so.\nBut if perchance I die, my death is not because of you. It is for you. Truly, everything I do, I do for you. I can speak to no one. I can only transcribe my thoughts to you, and hope that the couriers will fulfil their duties in relaying my words. Please accept this truth at the very least.\nPlease think of it as a gift. Please await it. I am at the midway mark. I can see myself standing on this bridge of woven moonlight and sky-song. A bridge above the rippling sunsets and the afterglow of retired constellations. I can see the stars. Do you see them too? They are \u2014 oh \u2014 so bright and beckoning. I see \u2014 I think I see \u2014 a constellation up there. It is an arrow.\nAlways and forever yours,\nRuri\n***\nSeori,\nThere has not been word from you in a week. Did you receive my letter? I wait patiently for the couriers each and every day but none ever has anything for me. Perhaps this tired and weary body is simply impatient. The physician says I should sleep more. I do, but my limbs still are slow. My memory comes and goes like spouts of rain in a year of drought. The medicine is packed with bitterness. It makes me sag with drowsiness too.\nI want to get better. So that I can finally go out and travel to wherever you are. Oh\u2026 there is someone at the door. I think I hear the voice of the courier. Perhaps it is a delivery. I hope to hear from you soon. Please write back.\nSincerely,\nRuri\n***\nMy beloved Seori,\nPlease say something. Anything. Are you mad at me? Are you upset? Are you unhappy? I know my body is not well, but it is what it is. You knew that I have always been a fragile one. Your silence is agony. It is unbearable compared to the bloody coughs that assail my lungs. I would rather live with the numbness in my knees than to have your silence. I have tears welling up in my eyes, not from the blade-like edges of silver paper, but from this absence. Without your letters, a chasm has blossomed in my memory.\nPlease. I need you. I have nothing but old letters and a jar full of silver cranes (it was the jar that arrived at my doorstep; it is useful to my project\u2026 but it is not you).\nAccording to the calendar, the full moon is only a couple of nights away. I have only about two hundred cranes or so left to fold. I know I can do this, even though each careful crease seems to take a year out of me. Even though it can be quite the lonely process, with me and my thoughts. Your words used to occupy that space in my head. Now there are only shadows. And a moth. It has been roosting on the ceiling for a week or so. It is no bother to me at all. I am not afraid of such creatures.\nDid you know that a moth is said to represent the soul of a departed loved one that watches over you? It is unmoving but I can tell \u2014 I don\u2019t know how, it\u2019s just a feeling \u2014 that the moth is watching over me. Like my silver cranes. Each origami crane is a plane folded with all my wrinkles. All my thoughts of you, all my hopes and dreams tucked into its beak and plume. Such is the price for perfection.\nI dreamed of a lavender sky last night. I wonder what shade of sky I will dream of tonight. I wonder if you too are gazing at the same sky.\nDreaming,\nRuri\n***\nDear Seori,\nA hundred more cranes to go. Once I tear today\u2019s date off, it will be exactly one night to the full moon. I promise you, I will make this wish happen.\nDo write back.\nI miss you.\nSo much.\nRuri.\n***\nSeori,\nI finished it!\nA thousand cranes perched inside the glass jar. Any minute now, the moon will be upon us in her radiant beauty.\nPlease, wait for me! I am coming! I promise! I will be there!\nYour R\n***\nSeori can you hear me? can you hear?\nyou wont believe it the second the first moonbeam hit the jar it started to tremble the silver cranes started fluttering they were flying as if they were real cranes\nthey were beautiful you should\u2019ve seen it a myriad of pearly wings flocking towards the stars then the last silver crane grew until it was as tall as me if not taller it told me to climb onto its back at least it seemed as if it was talking to me and i could understand it\nam i dreaming is this all real is it just a dream where is the queen with the lilac butterflies if this be a dream where are they the skies are a kaleidoscope of stars the winds shift and swirl in an inky indigo\ni see the arrow it is illuminating i can\u2019t hear anything not even the cranes\u2019 wings oh the arrow\u2019s getting bigger and bigger everything is silent like a sea of tranquillity i don\u2019t know where i\u2019m going i don\u2019t know where the arrow where the cranes are leading me to but i think i know i think \u2014\n[Learn more about Sadako Sasaki.]","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

I scrub a white plate with a neon green silicone sponge, the sleeves of my gray wool sweater are pushed up past my elbows. The water is hot and I relish my stinging hands in the drafty apartment.\nYou will remember this, I think.\nBut I am only remembering this moment. This bookmark in my life. It\u2019s actually five years later. My house is beginning to burn while I stand across the street with my neighbors. Firefighters are screaming at us to leave.\nYou will remember this. I don\u2019t want to think this but I do.\nInside my burning house is that gray wool sweater.\nBack at the sink I think about summer. Skin exposed to the sun. The skin of another man pressed against my own. My feet tingle with cold inside my thick socks: Poor circulation runs in my family.\nThe air is filled with the ashes of my possessions. The ones I decided to leave behind when I had five minutes to decide. It\u2019s the driest summer on record. It\u2019s always the driest summer on record.\nPrison inmates are putting out wildfires, they are paid two dollars an hour for this work. But the inmates are somewhere else; where other things are burning.\nYou will remember this. I\u2019m five and I\u2019m leaning against my parents\u2019 emerald green couch. My small fingers are trying to grip the velvet upholstery. I like how slippery the fabric is.\nBack at the sink I remember the first time I learned to anchor myself in time, at my parents\u2019 green sofa, to always have these moments to come back to. I wonder if I am actually experiencing this moment washing dishes or remembering it in the future.\nA brown glass slips out of my hand and falls into the sink, shattering. It was vintage. Physicists don\u2019t understand why time only moves one direction when the equations of existence work forwards as well as backwards.\nBut I understood it was possible since I was a child.\nMy mother is washing dishes. I walk up to her, terrified of what I must say. I pull at the sleeves of my oversized red sweater.\nYou will remember this.\nI\u2019m having a stroke. Parts of my brain are shutting down and I\u2019m trying to focus on calling for help, on waving my arm, on a small brown bird in a tree. My cane gives out under my trembling weight and I collapse into the fresh-cut grass of the park. The sun is out. The light feels hot.\nI smell smoke.\nI turn away from my burning house and remember the way the wool sweater felt warm and coarse on my arms as I get into my car.\nMy mother picks me up and carries me away from the couch. I start to cry. I don\u2019t want to cry. I want to tell my mother that I love her and not to wait so long to go to the doctor when she\u2019s 64. But I don\u2019t tell her this because I\u2019m only five years old.\nA man turns away from me in bed and says, \u201cI\u2019ll remember this.\u201d His skin looks blue in the dark.\nThree years ago I pressed him up against a fence near my apartment, desperate to hear him moan.\nMy mother reaches up from her bed and puts a bony hand on my cheek. A green and pink paisley silk scarf is wrapped around her head. I let my gaze fall into the infinite repeating patterns.\nDoctors still don\u2019t understand why some cancer patients waste away.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to remember me like this,\u201d she says.\nI close my eyes.\nYou will remember this.\nI push myself up from the pavement. People are running past me. The air buzzes. Something is burning, a car maybe. Across the street I see a woman holding a man in her arms. His shirt is soaked in his blood. She keeps the man looking at her while she strokes his face.\nThe army opened fire on the demonstrators.\nI am worried about that man; that he might die if we don\u2019t get him to a hospital.\nThe woman jerks up to look at me, eyes wide. Something smashes into the back of my head and everything goes black. The blackness becomes the dark green of the velvet couch. My small fingers are gripping into it and relaxing over and over again.\nThe man in bed with his back to me is crying. I put my hand over the mole on his shoulder blade and he pulls away from me.\nThe sun breaks out over the mountains. The five of us have been awake all night, drinking around the campfire. We smell like smoke. The sky slowly ignites and we fall silent.\nYou will remember this.\nI shiver in the cold. I take a red wool sweater out of the closet and pull it over my head. Downstairs I can smell my husband brewing coffee. I used to have a sweater like this in gray. It took years to find one like it.\nI pull at my sleeves. I can\u2019t remember what I had just said. My mother reaches into the dishwater and her green plastic gloved hand pulls out a glass.\nShe turns to me and smiles, \u201cI know sweetie.\u201d\nYou will remember this.\nWhat happened to those people I watched the sunrise over the mountain with? Where are they now?\nI shake my head and turn off the sink. I must have been daydreaming. I prick my finger on a shard of glass and jerk my hand back. A droplet of blood wells up on my skin.\nI do not know about the fires that will consume the state in five years. I do not know about the riots that swept the city a decade after. I am just waiting for summer, to press myself up against a man in the dark of a warm evening.\n\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d my husband asks.\n\u201cA green sofa,\u201d I say.\nAcross the street I see the woman holding a man in her arms. His shirt is soaked in his blood. She keeps the man looking at her while she strokes his face.\nThat man is going to die.\nThe woman jerks her head up to look at me, her eyes wide.\nI think I am dying now. Parts of my brain are shutting down, but I\u2019ve never felt so focused in my life. The bright blue afternoon sky turns black. The blackness becomes the dark green of the velvet couch. My small fingers are gripping into it and relaxing over and over again. My mother picks me up and carries me away from the couch. I start to cry.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

To preserve their idiosyncratic character, The Fabulist Words & Art has eschewed the usual editorial process and presents these texts as written.\nThe city has finally come into full-bloom, crowded with offices and people in suits. City fashion has even taken villages by storm, so much so that farmers have started wearing their suits into the fields\u2026.\nOn the fifth of July, 1977, I was born in a coastal town. In October, 1982, I ate a doughnut covered with sand. A year later I will do the same. On the 17th of April, 1986, I accidentally cut my thumb into two. The stub of my thumb lay red on the table.\nIn November, 1989, whales came on to the land, sailing past us, past city corners. While we were busy playing at sea, flip-flopping whales slowly died in the city. On the 15th of July, 1990, I went away to boarding school.\nAt no exact point did I return.\n***********\nIn the city was the street where our apartment stood on the 5th story of a six- story building.\nOur apartment stood suspended in air while I walked about it in my pajamas. I was looking for a tooth I had been playing with which I knew I had kept underneath one of the pillows. I had come to the last pillow in my bedroom on the fifth story of a six story building in a city suspended in air.\nAll we had was a carpet on top of which was a table, a coffee table with a vase that had flowers in it. I removed the flowers. Shweta removed the vase, as it had no use and could be kept away, or better still, broken, as we were never going to have flowers in this house anymore. The table was also put away and was eventually covered with an ugly sheet. Shweta and I always returned to the carpet, no matter where we went.\nWe had a shed at the back of the building where a carpenter used to come twice a week to make some useless wooden objects.\nOur city was crammed into a single courtyard with high walls and no windows to look out.\nThe country path never made its way here and the highway, which started in the suburbs, made endless circles around our town.\n***************\nI showed up accidentally in a city where I was not meant to be.\nOn a street I saw a telephone pole, which looked just like me. I stood next to it, to see if passers-by noticed the difference, but there were only telephone poles there.\nWhen I visited homes in the suburbs, I found that the people there were flies. I went back to the center. Even the telephone poles had been razed.\nI was surrounded by this city. If the city disappeared, I did, too. I was surrounded by myself. If I disappeared, I\u2019ll still be there.\n*************************\nOur city was once a fortress. It took four entire days to break down her walls. Only the doors remained. Much later, no one could have been sure on which side of the doors the city stood.\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\nIn the old city park new city residents were not allowed.\nAs a child, while playing there, I was picked up by a vulture. When he dropped me down, I was all grown up and knew how to fly. I flew past an abandoned city. The inhabitants had all fled to a neighboring town, which looked identical.\nWhen I got there, I found that the city was not abandoned but created for trespassers. They would be left breaking into empty homes.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

While there are a lot of shadows here, not one of them strikes me as unnatural \u2014 severed from the body that casts it, or moving against the sunlight.\nYet the shadows are beautiful in their intensity and depth. A depth that doesn\u2019t simply turn greys into blacks (nature is never that banal!), but creates the impression, just underneath the surface, of an endless, cavernous space you can get lost in \u2014 or have your searching gaze met.\nSometimes the shadows (of people, trees, buildings, monuments) jitter gently, slow-dancing with the eye and unsettling the senses. It is easy for a conspirative mind to see an exit in the dark; wormholes leading Elsewhere.\nNa\u00effs are all around, and always full of hope.\n* * *\nI arrived here shortly before 6 p.m. The cafe that I had decided would be my headquarters for the duration of my stay was still open. It was called Journals, and boasted the most serene garden and biggest salon in the area. Its tables and parasols spilled out not only onto the street and the public park in the front, but also onto the unnaturally green lawn in the back, framed by bushes dotted with delicate purple flowers under large, smooth leaves, reflecting the light in deep violet. Inside, all but one wall, the one behind the bar, were mirrored, giving the illusion of more space and light than there ought to have been.\nI had written to the proprietor in advance, asking for a permanent reservation in my name, and that I would be able to receive mail there. My forethought was rewarded as soon as I sat down: Next to a metal plate with my name on it in magnetic letters lay an envelope.\nIt was the first I\u2019d heard from Leno in some time. It contained a single sentence, just as I expected: I know where you are.\nThe rumored exits from the City were Leno\u2019s one true passion. He dreamt of them, yearned for them, tirelessly searched for them and, sometimes, even tried to create them himself.\nAll in vain, of course \u2014 he was just a poet and the only thing poets really know about are their own words.\nI once thought I was Leno\u2019s greatest passion, and, later, that I could be Leno\u2019s greatest passion if only I replaced the City in his heart, his mind, and on his pages.\nThat too didn\u2019t last long. I was quickly made to understand that those rumored exits, invisible and untouchable, were the focal points of his desire, and my body and mind were bare of them.\nYet, inexplicably, Leno never gave up wanting me by his side.\nI didn\u2019t waste much time on the letter, one of many since he had supposedly \u201cdisappeared.\u201d His letters still found me everywhere, impeccably timed, as if he was following me, always a few steps behind, just a room or floor away, wherever I\u2019d choose to stay.\nThen again, I didn\u2019t exactly make it hard for him.\n* * *\nThe local Instrumentarium was one of the last in the City, according to the Visitor\u2019s Bureau leaflet I got from the hostel. It was poorly written, but the photographs were nice, of famous poets or artists who had passed through, stayed or lived in the District. The chapter dedicated to the Instrumentarium, the longest and most thorough, also contained a number of drawings, by artists of considerable renown, of the various tools and inventions in which the City\u2019s citizens had placed their hopes of escape.\nI was most impressed by the photograph of a chariot pulled, the caption enthused, by demons from outside of the City. A smaller shot next to it, of the device\u2019s interior, showed the pile of small bones, almost childlike, of the last person who took it for a ride.\nThe Instrumentarium, when I finally made my way there, was a small, nondescript building on the outskirts of the Shadow District. I was greeted by an official dressed like an old-fashioned shopkeep (black trousers, short-sleeved white shirt, and black gloves covering his forearms) who either had a glass eye or the way his hair fell over his face created the impression of one.\nThe chariot was in for restoration, he told me, but could they show me a collection of maps from almost 400 years ago?\n\u201cNot a lot has changed about how maps are made, but the exhibits we keep contain the blood of young women of high birth, which was as rare then as it is now,\u201d he said.\nI had a look at the maps (nothing spectacular), as well as two tomes of poetry written by poets and amateurs alike who had tried leaving the City by consuming leprous flesh. There were a few gems scattered throughout the volumes, but most amounted to little more than vague recollections.\nI don\u2019t believe disease can be a way out \u2014 of the City or anywhere else. (Maybe out of life, but even that\u2019s inaccurate; I haven\u2019t heard of anyone actually dying from leprosy.) It\u2019s not a plague, in that sense, but its mythology of escape has plagued the dreams and fears of the City. If scholars are to be believed, Cities cannot exist without their own mythology; that\u2019s what you\u2019ll know a City by, if you ever were able to leave this one.\nOnce there had been an Instrumentarium in almost every district of the City. The wealthy ordered copies of the more bizarre instruments and hoarded them in their homes, a meekly comforting gesture to an escape few dared to contemplate in earnest. One former mayor allegedly slept in a replica of Tamara\u2019s Bed \u2014 the one she used to try to leave the City, cloaked in a see-through nightgown and opium vapors, convinced that delirium would be the key to its invisible doors.\nNowadays, Instrumentaria are little more than museums, quiet and curious, entombing the fruits of restless minds long extinguished. Few ever enter them as potential escapees, but rather as tourists, their desperate longing for the impossible atrophying into mere historical curiosity. This always fills me with sadness.\nThe Shadow District\u2019s Instrumentarium held in its collection a unique model of the City, one of the most sophisticated devices (if several scientists, dozens of philosophers, and thousands of pilgrims are to be believed) ever built to attempt an escape with. I only saw it on my second visit there.\nI was out on a walk, admiring the streets at that particular time of day when the afternoon turns into evening; when the birds in the park (which I never got close enough to identify) start singing louder, driving up with them the volume of the City\u2019s orchestra of other sounds \u2014 screams and laughter from the markets, conversations in the cafes, the hum of the traffic \u2014 before all suddenly grinding to a halt, as if extinguished by the night afoot.\nI didn\u2019t think the Shadow District would be any different, but I needed to make sure. I needed to trace the lines of the urban soundscape, the particular metamorphosis of the noises of the City that charts the way to a place better than any map could. I needed the familiarity of it to soothe me. And it did \u2014 my walk went off without a hitch and the last calls of the market traders sounded as piercingly loud and clear through the creeping dusk here as anywhere else.\nI crossed the Instrumentarium\u2019s threshold in an euphoric near-trance \u2014 I didn\u2019t mean to actually visit, I just wanted a moment of silence. Sleepwalking through exhibition rooms and corridors lined with the dreams and desires of scientists and madmen locked in crystal sarcophagi, I finally found myself in a massive, suspiciously well-lit central hall.\nThere, on an altar-like table of solid marble, lay the model of the City.\nAnd then the lights went out.\nTo be sure, I remember being startled, peering through the sudden darkness, one of my hands in a fist, the other clutching my bag, but I wouldn\u2019t say I was scared. In hindsight, it wasn\u2019t fear that I felt, but rather the discomfort of trying to keep my confusion from growing into terror.\nWhen the light returned, this time flowing from the center of the model, I was less surprised than curious.\nThe light started from what I believe was a tiny diorama of the Instrumentarium itself, snaked its way through the tiny streets of the replica Shadow District, filled up a random building, seeped through its windows, left through the front door, disappeared for a second, and then exploded from the belly of a large mansion a few streets away. A moment later, it darted to the edge of the model and went out as suddenly as it had appeared.\nI followed it all in complete silence, only realizing I\u2019d forgotten to breathe when the hall lights came back on, bright as before. I closed my eyes and retraced the illuminated path that wound through the model City streets. I opened them again and it was gone from my memory.\nBut there was something else in that reflection of the City that remained. I\u2019ve spent countless days and nights since seeing the model trying to figure out what it was. I guess it will always stay just beyond the reach of my conscious memory \u2014 the presence that caught my gaze and allowed it to linger, for a second, a minute, a century, on the face of the simulacrum.\nMy mind went blank, cognizant of my eyes moving through the streets, peeking through the tiny windows, circling the town squares, yet unable to read any sign. I remember the emptiness I felt then, staring at the model of the City, and I know it was something no ink could truly hold, not even for the briefest of moments. (A depressing thought, now that I\u2019m finally writing all of it down: that emptiness was not unlike the white of a blank page.\nI must have blinked, because I remember opening my eyes. I took a few steps back, flapped my arms in the air, and then took a deep breath and left that place.\n* * *\nThe dreams began several days after that second visit to the Instrumentarium, and there was nothing random about it.\n(Please don\u2019t take this as an endorsement of those who think that the City is a living creature, a complex organism of buildings, dust and flesh, speaking only to a few chosen citizens and jealously refusing to let anyone, even His acolytes, leave. I don\u2019t believe the City sent me the dreams or poured them into my head in order to communicate or to make a point. I am convinced, however, even though the clarity of the dream receded somewhat come morning, that I know something now about the City, something real, that I didn\u2019t know before; that I\u2019ve been chosen, or called to. But let me tell you about the dreams first, just a summary, without any of the details \u2014 colors or sensations \u2014 that I\u2019m sure my memory, anyway, changes every time.)\nIn the first dream I have a name \u2014 Aura. Or perhaps Laura, I am not sure. I am in a big house, a mansion by the looks of it, which is not my home. I am not alone: A boy and a man are in the room with me. I know there are servants all around the house, but I cannot see them.\nAt some point I realize that I am there to be examined. No \u2026 I am there so someone else can escape. Maybe the man, because I can feel his constant presence. He wants to do something with my body \u2026 my blood, to be exact. My menstrual blood.\nI remember, vividly, lying on the floor, a map next to me which I cannot see but know all too well. It is a map of the City \u2014 streets, squares. Blood runs down the streets. The man follows the flow of it intently, with his eyes, his fingers and with something else, something inside his heart and soul.\nI also know that the boy is sick. It is the plague, the leprosy of the City, which is at best too sexualized and, at worst, venerated as the only way to leave it.\nIn the second dream I do not have a name. I am a man and I am suffering. An affliction of some sort has left an enormous mark on my body. Huge. I think it covers my entire back, but I can neither see nor feel it. I just know it is there. In my dream I am walking through the City, looking for something, and I have a companion. I cannot see his face but I know he comes from the Desert. He\u2019s a Bedouin. He touches me often. He tells me I am cold to the touch, especially my back.\nAt some point we both find ourselves in a place that is neither the City, nor the Desert. The Bedouin says that this is Necropolis. I look down at my feet, at our feet, and see a hole, a giant hole, full of something that is neither dark nor light nor anything, but still enormous.\nIn the third dream I am a writer, but I am not myself. I write fantastic stories, about alien worlds and distant planets. (This is strange, because in real life I have never been interested in theories about places other than the City.) In this dream, my universe is a simple one \u2014 it consists only of the City, the Desert, the Necropolis, and the Cosmos, which astronauts come back from zombified and covered in seeping wounds, if they come back at all.\nOne such astronaut is home with me in the dream. He loves me or I love him.\nBoth of us are sitting at my desk, I see us very clearly, and we\u2019re both writing. No, I have written something \u2014 I can see the words on the white page, something about an alien planet, people, mutants, spaceships, and laser guns.\nUnder the unfinished text, there is still some blank space left. And he spits on it \u2014 I can see him as if he\u2019s standing before me right now! \u2014 the astronaut spits on it. It\u2019s not derision. It\u2019s not saliva either. It\u2019s blood. The astronaut spits out a glob of blood, takes a pen and starts writing with it. I read over his shoulder and \u2026\n* * *\nEvery time I have to write about the City, I am reminded of that old nursery rhyme. You know the one I mean \u2014 it goes \u201csomething something, don\u2019t ask me if the City has a name.\u201d\nI try to imagine what such a name would sound like, but I can\u2019t, it\u2019s always beyond the reach of my imagination.\nIt wasn\u2019t in any of the dreams, but in the morning after the last oneI caught myself thinking again about the name of the City and, as soon as I did, a memory \u2014 or rather a pseudo-memory \u2014 planted its flag in my brain and glued the pieces of that day\u2019s story together long enough for me to transfer it onto the page. It\u2019s interesting how many fake memories are required to maintain the delusion of our own wholeness, our own sleek continuity, no pauses or cracks or missing bits to unsettle the reflection.\nTwo days before leaving the District I received Leno\u2019s second message: \u2026 But you still don\u2019t know where I am.\nReading it made me smile. I imagined him thinking we\u2019re having a conversation, that this game matters to me, that I may even hope it\u2019s not a game.\nThe rest of the day was wonderful.\n* * *\nMy last day in the Shadow District ended with a cup of cold afternoon coffee and a meeting with a stranger.\nI had barely sat down at the table at Journals that I had come to think of as \u201cmine\u201d when the waiter \u2014 a thin man I had allowed myself to call \u201cfriend\u201d a few times and for whom I always left a solid tip \u2014 waltzed up to me, right hand tightly gripping his left, lips stretched into a smile.\nHe let out a theatrical sigh (I couldn\u2019t help but imagine him on a stage, blinding spotlights turning the audience below into a sea of brilliant darkness) and informed me that their coffee machine was broken \u2014 fully or partially I didn\u2019t quite understand \u2014 so today they could only, regrettably, serve cold coffee. Not yesterday\u2019s coffee, he was quick to add, but this morning\u2019s, and they can warm it up with milk, since the stove\u2019s burners did, of course, work, but they could only heat the milk, as the head chef did not believe in reheated coffee.\nThat\u2019s the word he used, believe. I smiled at him and ordered a cup, no milk, cold is fine. He hesitated for just a second, out of embarrassment or politeness, then gave a courteous nod and vanished into the kitchen.\nI turned to the street and saw a man approaching my table, tall and dressed all in black, a wide-brimmed hat casting a shadow over his face: the perfect stranger.\n\u2018May I?\u2019 he asked, pointing to the empty chair opposite me.\nI nodded but didn\u2019t smile. He was an actor, I was sure, one of those who roam around the City, performing short sketches for a private audience. My sister and I, together with Leno and a friend of his \u2014 Nari \u2014 had also hired one, a long time ago. We had asked him to approach the first white-haired woman he\u2019d see, and start talking to her in a made-up language, gesturing wildly over a crude, crayon-drawn \u201cmap\u201d of the City. When the poor woman finally has enough and tries to leave, he was to fall to the ground, fold himself into a fetal position, and start crying.\nIt worked quite well, and was moderately entertaining, but we never did do it again.\nI looked around for my stranger\u2019s audience, thinking that I\u2019d be able to recognise the ill-conceived anticipation in the spectators\u2019 faces, having been one myself: a pair of pursed lips, a long pause between breaths, knuckles white with tension, knees quivering, or just wide-open eyes and mouths, the witness oblivious to being seen.\nBut this time the audience must\u2019ve been made up of professionals, not enthusiastic novices, because I identified no one. No suspicious whispers, nobody looking our way, not even with their peripheral vision, and no curious heads turned in mischief.\nI decided to smile at the man; I wanted to see what his patrons had come up with. He did not return my smile.\n\u201cAre you enjoying your stay in the District?\u201d he asked.\nI told him I was, that I liked it here, and was happy. I asked if it was that obvious that I\u2019m not local.\nHis face relaxed at this, but he said nothing. I let the silence grow: I had no intention of making the performance easier for him.\n\u201cMaybe I should introduce myself. My name is of no consequence, really, but you can have it: it\u2019s Flan\u2014\u201d\nI nodded to indicate that that\u2019s enough for me.\n\u201cI work for an organization about which you have surely not heard,\u201d he continued, \u201cand which does not officially exist.\u201d\nA secret service in the Shadow District? How original.\n\u201cThe knowledge of our existence is blood-borne. Hereditary, I mean. It is why most people haven\u2019t heard of us, but I can assure you we work for the good of the City\u201d\nI asked him what that means.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always danger,\u201d he said, and I liked how a single cloud passed in front of the sun at that very moment, desaturating the world around in time with his art. \u201cWe\u2019ve been watching you for a while now. We sat in on some of your dreams and we are very interested. We would like to work with you some more, and we\u2019d appreciate it if you didn\u2019t mind.\u201d\nI laughed at that; it felt like the right thing to do. He waited for me to finish, his eyes silently reiterating his words. I asked him what is so special about my \u201cdreams\u201d (he smiled at my air quotes).\n\u201cThey confirm our observations of certain people, other people,\u201d he leaned in closer, \u201cwhom we believe want to leave the City.\u201d\nSo I\u2019m \u2026 an oneiro-hound? Something like that? An unwitting surveillance device? I think that\u2019s what I asked him.\nHe didn\u2019t reply, just reached into the inside pocket of his jacket and took out a business card. I didn\u2019t take it from his extended hand, so he placed it on the table between us. It wasn\u2019t a business card, but a blank piece of thick white paper. I didn\u2019t give it a second thought.\nWe parted with smiles befitting of the roles we had elected to play \u2014 mine understanding, his, enigmatic.\nI decided not to finish my coffee. There was still some packing left for me to do, and a very, very short trip home.\nThe End\nLeno, I don\u2019t know why I wrote this the way I did, or, for that matter, why I wrote it at all. A few of the City\u2019s literary magazines and newspapers sent it back without any feedback; one \u2014 \u2018CritiQue\u2019 \u2014 enclosed the following line:\nWe welcome any attempt to fictionalize the inexplicable experience of living in the City, but are tired, so tired now.\nNever mind them. I haven\u2019t spoken to anyone since my return from the Shadow District. I must admit, the sarcasm permeating the text above, if you can sense it at all, is but my feeble resistance against everything that happened while I was writing it. Sometimes I wish I could believe them when they say the City has His own consciousness and will. But believing would mean giving in to fear. Because, if the City speaks, then you\u2019d be able to recognize His words over where my rebellion should be.\nI can\u2019t shake off the feeling, I keep wanting to push back even after I\u2019m done laboring over the blank page, even after the text is finished. I walk down the street and He\u2019s there; I look up to the rooftops or in the windows of the houses, He\u2019s there; every blurry colorful abstraction that is supposed to be my reflection in a shop window suddenly morphs into the most natural thing in the world: the face of the City.\nI feel anger, my anger drives me mad at times. I start searching, I start digging, I start looking for other faces, other features. I never find any, but I did see a shadow, one particular shadow, the color of ebony, that looked like I could send something through it. So I tried: I shouted at the night and saw my words hit a wall on the other side of the street. I don\u2019t think I need to tell you more, I know you understand. I also know I shouldn\u2019t be writing, not a letter more, for every word is a threat and every sentence opens up space enough for another voice to form over the static.

Paths looped around sheets of lawn protectively pinned down along the edges by omniscient grandparent trees. It was autumn and bits of lunchtime sandwiches and stale popcorn after football games seemed welcome by the squirrels preparing for winter.\nThe people making the offerings were mesmerized by their ability to tame nature with leftovers. They showed their friends. They brought their small children who would squat low and wait patiently in the grass, hand outstretched, as a squirrel materialized and plucked the favor out of the child\u2019s pudgy fingers with its own slim-fingered, razor-nailed paws.\nBut on a regular Tuesday, one squirrel did something different. It looked up at the strange creature offering residue and condescension, left the peanut and took the \u201cDo you want a peanut?\u201d instead.\nIt went unnoticed until later in the day when a young couple brought some burnt half-loops of cinnamon roll they had unwound from the outermost circle of the pastry.\nThe woman leaned over and attempted a sing-song \u201cDo you want a treat?\u201d but only managed an odd silence followed by the loud belching out of the single word, \u201ctreat.\u201d\nShe quickly covered her mouth with her hand, all hot-faced embarrassment, and the man lead her away through the trees that popped and snapped with an unfamiliar energy.\nSquirrels have different vision than humans. They can see the thoughts that trail behind us and usually disperse harmlessly into the air. So they began to take those sentences too.\nIf you were jogging and thinking about what to cook for dinner, they took your, \u201cI\u2019m so tired of spaghetti\u2026 what is wrong with me, some people have nothing to eat.\u201d\nIf you were heading to an exam, they took your \u201cConstantinople was the capital of the Ottoman Empire from 1453\u20131923.\u201d They took his, \u201cI don\u2019t love her anymore,\u201d and their, \u201cWhat is a quasar?\u201d\nAnd one lucky child had her, \u201cI don\u2019t think I can do this\u201d snatched by a squirrel as it leapt from branch to branch right over her head.\nThey couldn\u2019t be stopped because squirrels are invisible when they choose. They sit up on their haunches like granite holding its breath. Their glossy, vacant, midnight eyes scan the landscape for a burial plot. When you blink, they snap sharply around, cutting the air recklessly like the flipping last foot of film on a movie reel and run off with your words trailing behind them.\nYou stand there slack-jawed and silenced looking down at the peanut on your open palm, or opening and closing your mouth like a cod flopping in the hull of a boat.\nIt was unclear why the squirrels buried the sentences. Most people thought it was just out of habit or perhaps it was going to be a particularly harsh winter for communication. Some hoped they would sprout and grow into blossoming paragraphs but they didn\u2019t know that sentences can only grow down through the soil into root-like anchors that the ground will never release.\nA few people overcame their shock quickly enough to lunge after a thieving squirrel while it was stuffing sentences into its overflowing cheeks. The squirrels were always too fast to be caught but sometimes were startled enough to leave fragments or scrambled letters behind. This usually resulted in more harm than good as people would end up yelling things they didn\u2019t mean, like \u201cI _ate you god____ squirrels,\u201d and \u201cI need the nodes to call back the cukes!\u201d\nSome of the most desperate people would hold a spade in each hand and spin their arms like a whirly-bird to dig up and try to recover buried sentence fragments. They would then furiously shove them down their throats only to vomit up a word or two and splutter out a pile of the smaller, lighter punctuation.\nIn their desperation these people often became violent squirrel hunters by developing machine guns that shot periods and deadly comma boomerangs, and by sharpening exclamation points into the most interjective of knives.\nBut the squirrels adapted. They stopped burying the sentences in the ground and began to hide them in plain sight where no person ever looked.\nSentences ran along tree limbs like Christmas lights. They were the wires between telephone poles, where birds rested on \u201cmothers\u201d and \u201cfrightened\u201d and \u201cquizzically\u201d and \u201cmustaches.\u201d They were shoved in supermarket shelves between the cereal brand names.\nThe most brazen squirrels would steal a sentence and then use it to replace the plantaris tendon in the victim\u2019s calf. It is the longest tendon in the human body, so there is plenty of room, especially in a small font.\nThe world got quieter. Eventually people adapted because although they were angry, they hadn\u2019t really been listening to most of the sentences anyway.\nAlso, any real objection was futile because the squirrels had taken all the screams for help.\nThe buried sentences continued rooting and spreading into underground manifestos and the squirrels retrieved the sturdy \u201clyrical\u201d and \u201cinstinct\u201d and wove their winter nests in the highest crooks of the grandparent trees.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

I\u2019m a squirrel. Look at me. Look at my tail. I\u2019m awesome.\u201d\nI could see that he was.\n\u201cGive up,\u201d he said, and he ran up the nearest tree.\nI had decided that in the summer I\u2019d make a personal goal to try to walk every inch of the city, up and down all the hills, until I had been to every corner. I wondered if I could do it.\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the squirrel.\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m looking at you.\u201d\nI told him to get lost. I didn\u2019t see him again, but I knew that he knew his words would always stay with me.\n* * *\nThe reason I wanted to walk to every corner was because I had exhausted all of the places I\u2019d already been to. I wanted to be somewhere new. What if I turned down this road, or through this park?\nI had the strong feeling there was something I was supposed to be doing, and the something was for a reason, but the things I ended up doing never matched up. I had the sense of purpose but not an actual purpose.\nThe other day a friend of mine handed me a book. \u201cYou\u2019ll like it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s good.\u201d\nI took her word for it, took the book home, and put it on a shelf. A week later I took it off the shelf and handed it back and said, \u201cYou\u2019re right. I did like it.\u201d\n* * *\nWalking through the park one night I met a dolphin. He was grey, with two big flippers, a dorsal fin, and a tail. He was lying in the fountain, eating fish. \u201cHey,\u201d I said, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cMind your own business,\u201d he said.\nI walked around him. \u201cNot looking for a fight,\u201d I said.\n\u201cFuck off.\u201d\nBut for some reason I couldn\u2019t get him out of my head, so before I came back through the park I bought some sardines. I fed them to him one at a time as he swore at me, flapping his tail. He didn\u2019t refuse though.\nA few nights later I asked him if he could teach me how to swim. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you know how to swim?\u201d he said. \u201cAre you poor?\u201d\nI told him I\u2019d just never learned. I used to go to a beach when I was younger but I never got in the water, only sitting in a folding chair and reading.\n\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he said.\nA week later we went out to the river. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t sink.\u201d Then he pushed me into the water, and it was so cold that I thought I would freeze to death. But I managed to tread.\n\u201cCan I ride you?\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou can drown,\u201d he said.\nI tried to swim alongside him, halting, clumsy, figuring out slowly that maybe I should put one arm in front of another, and maybe kick my legs. \u201cQuit splashing,\u201d he said. \u201cI hate that.\u201d I wasn\u2019t a very good swimmer. But I didn\u2019t die, so I considered it a success.\n\u201cDo you ever sleep?\u201d I asked him.\n\u201cSort of,\u201d he said. \u201cI can kind of shut my brain off a bit. But I\u2019m always awake. Got to keep swimming. And look out for sharks and things.\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever met a shark?\u201d\n\u201cAm I alive right now?\u201d\nI assumed he was alive.\nEven though he never invited me back I kept hanging out with him. Eventually he showed me a few things that I could do to avoid looking like an idiot. I did my best. There wasn\u2019t any reason for swimming. I would never do this while in a pool or at a beach. But I kept coming back.\nThe dolphin was eventually killed.\n* * *\nAt the end of the summer I went into the river and swam far out until I couldn\u2019t see the city anymore. It felt good now, knowing how to do it. I never did walk to every corner.\nWhy did it take me so long to learn? But there was no point in wondering, because there was nothing I could change.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

In the bathroom, you look between your legs with a hand mirror: Not a mark on you. You shower, to feel less strange. You smooth out the bill, spray it with rubbing alcohol, pat it dry, put it in your wallet, get dressed, and go to work.\nAll day at the office, you respond mechanically to the pings and whooshes of your computer. You are the lead consultant on a big client project. You do what they call knowledge work, which means you use your brain to think about ways to make other people money.\nBut all you can think about is: How did a $20 bill end up in my pussy?\nThis is bad for your productivity. You decide to blame yourself for the money\u2019s appearance: For your habit of sleeping naked, and for sometimes sleepwalking. You write off the $20 bill as a sleepwalking misadventure \u2014 a slightly perverse, money-origami project completed by your subconscious self.\nAt lunch time, you turn off your screen and go downstairs to the deli for a salad. You decide to spend the pussy money on your lunch and forget all about it. You make a detour to the bathroom to pee and sitting in your underwear is a $10 bill: Your pussy money has had a baby.\nThere goes the self-inflicted origami theory, you think.\nYou are very confused, but you wash the bill with soap and water and dry it with the air dryer. The baby buys your lunch, and the pussy money stays in your wallet.\nAs you pick through your slightly wilted, pussy-money-baby salad, you do what you always do when you feel vulnerable: Make a plan and armor yourself.\nThat night, you put on your most complicated underwear, the underwear with straps and clips and buckles, the underwear that makes men very hard but also very frustrated with you, because they never know how to take it off.\nNo one has gotten past this crazy get-up unless you\u2019ve taken it off yourself.\nYou wear the matching corset for good measure, double-check all the windows and doors to ensure they are locked, and go to sleep, feeling clever and safe.\nIn the morning you wake up sore from the outfit, your skin indented by its hardware. But the indentations are worth it: When you check between your legs there\u2019s no money, and you are relieved.\nAs you wriggle out of the corset, you see a $100 bill flattened onto your right breast, Benjamin Franklin\u2019s face nuzzling your nipple. You sit down to think but can\u2019t make any sense of it: You planned ahead and armored yourself, yet here is more of what you did not want.\nYou look at Benjamin Franklin\u2019s face and whisper-ask him, What do you know that I don\u2019t know?\nBut all he does is keep smiling that smug smile of his. You put him in your wallet next to your pussy money and go to work, your face as tight as his smile.\nAt the office your mind moves quickly, disjointedly. Your confusion is swirled with anger and helplessness.\nCan I even be mad? you think. Clearly there is no culprit. And it\u2019s free money.\nBut when has money ever been free? And why does this money insist on touching the most intimate parts of your body?\nYou can feel the lower lid of your left eye start to twitch, and you type a little too hard in response to all your computer\u2019s noises. By lunch time you are really angry and really hungry. Then you open your wallet and there is a 500 euro note nestled against Benjamin Franklin and your pussy money.\nYour anger diminishes immediately, and the instant appeasement you feel makes you doubt your feminism. Uneasy and ashamed, on your way home you give away the U.S. currency. But you keep the 500 euro note. Your eye may still be twitching, but at least the 500 euros didn\u2019t touch your body.\nThat night when you go to bed, you wonder if it is useless to fight against this. Maybe you can work with whatever force is exerting itself upon you. You decide to test it and you say out loud, Can you do any better than single bills? Then add: And can you do it without touching me?\nYou realize it didn\u2019t occur to you to ask it to stop entirely, and again you doubt your feminism: You have to admit that you want the money, and you are willing to make some concessions to get it.\nYou toss and turn fitfully, because you don\u2019t know if you can trust the thing you are testing, but eventually you fall asleep.\nIn the morning there are crisp stacks of bills, of all denominations and various currencies, all over your bed. Nothing is touching you. You collect all the money and count it, using currency calculators when you need to, and it amounts to $50,000. You start to laugh, and the eye twitch is nearly imperceptible now. You leave the money on the bed and start to get dressed for work, but with less urgency than ever in your life.\nThanks very much, you say out loud. And on a whim, bordering on flirtation, you ask: What else you got?\nA few minutes later, before you leave for work, you check your bank balance, and the number on the screen is $26 million. You drop your phone and feel faint. You are a successful, educated, youngish professional woman living comfortably in a doorman building in one of the most expensive cities in the world, but you would have to work more than 172 years to earn this much money. Fuck-you money. You pick up your phone and type an email to your boss, quitting your job, effective immediately.\nYou are overwhelmed and spend a few minutes crying, then pull yourself together. You sit down with your laptop. You pay off your student loans. Anonymously, you wire $100,000 to your six closest friends and pay off your parents\u2019 mortgage.\nThen you start ordering everything you have ever wanted to buy: Nicer furniture, nicer clothes, a few pieces of art, a few pieces of jewelry, a trendy electric sports car with suicide doors.\nTwo hours and $750,000 later, you are surprised to have reached the limit of your desire. In fact, you find yourself bored.\nYou click and scroll listlessly. You briefly consider buying a house in the toniest neighborhood in the city and scheduling plastic surgery, but realize despite regular fantasies about both of these things you don\u2019t actually want either, that all you have ever wanted was to feel safe and like you could have whatever you want. So having this much money means you don\u2019t need the fancy house and you don\u2019t need to be pretty, either.\nYou feel free of something you hadn\u2019t even realized was oppressing you until you start to think about the unsolved mystery of this money, of its tie to your body. But then you hear a ping.\nIn your inbox is an invitation for a trip to the Galapagos Islands on Grace Kelly\u2019s former yacht, sent by a rich-people travel newsletter you\u2019ve never heard of. There is one cabin left, and it costs $285,000 for the week, not including airfare. The limits of your desire briefly expand. You click Book Trip and go to bed.\nThe next morning you feel a familiar pressure on your perineum and realize you\u2019ve not had a bowel movement since this all started. An hour later, after the most painful straining of your life, you have passed eighteen one-kilogram gold bars.\nYour hair is soaked with your sweat, and your bathroom wall is covered in your vomit. You lie on the bathroom floor and press your cheek against the cold tile. You\u2019re all alone and there\u2019s no one to tell, so all you can do is catch your breath. Then you get up, put on dishwashing gloves, and clean up your mess.\nYou gently transfer the gold bars from the toilet to the bathtub, where they glimmer like immobile, rectangular koi fish in a pond of disinfectant, and when you look at them your heart fills with a warmth and tenderness you have not known before, each bar something like a baby.\nIt\u2019s true that part of you feels nostalgic for the $20 that was secretly and painlessly tucked in your vulva just a few days ago. But technically nothing is touching your body anymore; your body has produced these eighteen gold bars, which are worth more than a million dollars, making the profuse rectal bleeding as good as painless.\nAnd the pain in your ass is a welcome distraction from the persistent twitch in your eye, which waxes and wanes unpredictably.\nA week passes, during which you pass a solid gold bar every single day, sometimes two or three, and your body has learned to expect them, so they don\u2019t hurt nearly as much as they did at first.\nYou learn some tricks: Lining your rectum with petroleum jelly so the bars pass easily, and taking magnesium glycinate so your bowel movements are regular. Your body will never produce actual feces again in your life, and you know this intuitively. You embrace your singular reality with the loving resignation of a new mother. You put your gold-bar babies in a closet and most of your millions of dollars in a brokerage account.\nIt\u2019s time now to go on your trip to the Galapagos. You have a moment of insecurity at the thought of being surrounded by mega-wealthy people, and you briefly consider buying a whole new wardrobe of even nicer clothes than you bought in your first shopping spree. But you decide against it, determined to dress as you would on any vacation, but with the full confidence of a woman who knows she shits gold.\nThe Galapagos Islands are beautiful. More beautiful than you could ever imagine. The water sparkles like a million diamonds and the tortoises crawl around regally, as slow and unbothered as you feel. The whole week is a dream, and you have several billionaires enamored with you, because despite your being a decidedly average-looking woman, your confidence makes you look amazing and your eyes shine with the bright hope of a future in which everything you can imagine is possible.\nThere\u2019s just one problem: It\u2019s the end of the week and the yacht has docked, and now you have to figure out how to get the dozen or so gold bars produced by you on this trip through customs so you can fly home.\nYou discreetly ask one of the billionaires, the most avuncular one, the only one who doesn\u2019t seem interested in you, how to move valuables through customs, and he doesn\u2019t even blink.\nAsshole money? he asks, and you nod, surprised. Me too, he says, as he gestures for you to follow him to his cabin.\nYou don\u2019t want to give him the wrong idea, so you step inside just long enough for him to show you a trunk at the foot of his bed, filled with gold bars.\nThe asshole money is the best kind of dividend because it\u2019s all tax-free, he chuckles.\nThe avuncular billionaire offers you a ride on his private jet, so you can avoid customs entirely, and when he sees you hesitate slightly he tells you, No pressure.\nAt the final group dinner on the yacht that night he talks a lot about his wife and children, and how excited he is about being launched into space soon. Later you tell him you would appreciate that ride on his jet.\nThe next morning, you glide through the airport to the tarmac and get in a limousine that takes you to the plane. On the plane, the billionaire excuses himself and goes to the back to make some calls about his impending space travel. And you fall asleep peaceful and content, wrapped in a cashmere blanket.\nA few hours later you wake up slowly to a soft stroking on your cheek. The avuncular billionaire is rubbing his half-erect penis on your face. You freeze for a moment, and look up at him. He smiles down at you, his face beatific, as though he is the Pope blessing you with his pastoral staff.\nYou smile back at him, and at the same time reach for your handbag and swing it as hard as you can against his head. He falls to the ground and swears at you.\nTry it again and you\u2019ll really be sorry, you say. It\u2019s full of asshole money.\nHis head is bleeding. He crawls to the back of the plane in a rage and says something you can\u2019t hear to the flight attendant, a tall, blonde, Scandinavian woman who looks like a retired supermodel.\nShe grabs you by the arm, pulls you out of your seat roughly, and says under her breath, Let\u2019s put on a show and I\u2019ll help you get out of here.\nShe drags you to a bathroom and locks you inside it. When you land, you hear her soothing the billionaire as he leaves the plane.\nMake her pay, he tells her, and you wonder what it is he thinks you owe him, and you don\u2019t even feel bitter, just amused. You realize for the first time that your eye is not twitching now, not even a little bit.\nA minute later, the flight attendant unlocks the door, and you point to the toilet. You\u2019ve produced three gold bars from all the stress, and you want her to have them.\nShe looks at you with very kind eyes and says, Thank you, but there\u2019s not enough time to sanitize them, and I\u2019ve had enough asshole money for a lifetime, so there\u2019s really no need.\nShe wraps you in a fur blanket and tells you to climb into a trunk. Your whole body begins to shake as you start to cry.\nHe\u2019s going to kill you, there\u2019s no other way this will play out, but she says, No, now you will be safe, and I will see to it.\nAnd as though she has done this a thousand other times for a thousand other women, she gently closes the lid of the trunk so strong men you don\u2019t know can carry you off the plane and put you in a car, so that she can take you home and have you sign an NDA.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

You with your hair falling out, you with your quick desire to live like a shot of whiskey going down your throat. You who I met when you leaned over the bar and whispered to me, Fuck me, I\u2019m dying.\nAnd I said, How do I know you\u2019re telling the truth?\nYou told me you would show me the results later, just come to the bathroom with you now, and so I followed you into the bathroom and you slid your hands up my skirt. I was wet already and you pushed me against the wall.\nYou said, I could tell from looking at you that you wanted to heal me like this, as you pulled my underwear down my legs.\nThat was quick, but this is slow. That was quick, but like slo-mo instant replay, it happened again and again in my mind. Perhaps it is still happening now.\nHere are the rules of the game: In the white room nothing will happen. We make the rules in the hospital. We will play roles like doctor and nurse and patient. When we are tired of playing a role we will switch roles.\nThere will be no psychiatric hospital scenes. All injuries are physical. All injuries can be healed by the doctor or the surgeon or the nurse or the patient.\nIf the patient does not want the injury cured because they are still attached to it, it will not be cured or it will heal very slowly. If the patient wants the injury cured immediately, this will be done.\nSlow healing will be nursed to. Slow healing will include many layers of bandages, salves, time. At a certain time every day the nurse will look at the wound and see how it is doing. Pleasure will be shown for slow and fast healing.\nSometimes the nurse will smile and hold the hand of the patient and say things like, You\u2019re going to be OK. You look so much healthier today.Your leg is really healing. I love the color of your throat, like a pink rose.\nDeath does not happen in this hospital. We have nothing against death, but that is in another play. If you want to switch to playing death, you must leave this hospital and enter another hospital or enter the home.\nChildbirth does not occur in this hospital. If you want to switch to playing childbirth, you must enter another hospital, a home, or a birthing pyramid.\nThere are three kinds of nurses. One is very attractive and young. She is entirely at home in her body in an unselfconscious way. When she is not being a nurse, she might be skiing or scuba diving.\nTwo is the nurse who looks like a grandmother. She is very wise and seems to know things. You know that she is comfortable with death and that to her death is just a door opening. She probably walks through that door sometimes and turns back just to take care of you.\nThree is the horrible nurse. We cannot leave out the horrible nurse. She is too archetypal. At times, her presence soothes the patient by reminding them of all that is bad in the world, an external pain, which can be held against the internal pain and provide comparative relief.\nMostly the patients hate the terrible nurse. She is important for their bonding, though. Without the terrible nurse, the patients would not be as close as they are. Think of the nurse in One Flew Over The Cuckoo\u2019s Nest. She hates you and wants to torture you. When she turns you over in bed it is only to see your bedsores and make a sick-faced look. When you ring the bell and she comes you think she is going to yell at you. Sometimes she does, she says things like Don\u2019t you know we have people here who are really sick?\nYou can choose the type of nurse you want. Perhaps you want different nurses at different times.\nToday I want the young nurse. She has her limits. She is puppyish in her actions, but I, like so many who are sick, desire to see really healthy flesh. Looking at her robust flesh gives me a generally good feeling. I like looking at the skin at the top of her breasts. It has a slight peach shade to it and it is firm with tiny white hairs.\nHer whole skin in fact is very much like a peach, even the smell which is fresh and smells of the outdoors. I breathe in the coolness and smells of fields and pine trees as she leans over me.\nI know that she has many lovers and this pleases me. I live vicariously through her. She is never unhappy. She is always pleased and full of vitality.\nI followed you to the hospital. After that night in the bar, I wanted to see you again. You refused to see me again and you went away to the hospital to play the game of being sick, and so I made myself sick to love you. You let me see you on certain days, days that you are not too sick or days that you are near to dying.\nToday your family was visiting you and making you tell them long stories about what they all meant to you with their guilty stares. We call it death-warmed-over-eyes, the looks that healthy people give us.\nWhile they were there, I came to your room and limped to the window to water a plant. Who is that woman? your wife asked and you answered that I was a ghost. I smiled and spilled the water on the windowsill.\nWe are ghosts and everyone else is alive, but being alive is so boring, really. They have to play the same games they have always been playing of trying to make sense of things all of the time, of trying to do enough for their family members before they die, of saying the right things. It must be so tiring.\nOf course I could choose what I am in the hospital for. I am in the hospital for a mysterious disease. They will never be able to put a name on it as long as I am in here. At times I joke heartily with the doctors that perhaps they will name the disease after me.\nNo, my handsome doctor with graying temples responds, they would name it after the doctor who discovered the illness, not the patient. (I know that he is sleeping with the young nurse and this pleases me inordinately.) Yes, only famous sports stars get diseases named after them.\nThis mystery disease also brings me a great deal of attention. Young doctors often come to visit me and look at my charts. I am proud that I have something so arcane and mysterious. My charts are lovely scratches of words and graphs and pictures that tell the real story of me. I always thought there should be a graphic representation of me that I can show people when first meeting. The charts come in handy for that.\nMy charts contain weird line drawings and x-rays of the food that I eat. There is a complete record of all the food that I have eaten since I arrived here. There is something inside the food that is making me sick. I have a theory that we can find this out by x-raying the food. The hospital staff patronizes me and so I have x-rays done of all my meals:\nLamb chop with peas and peach cobbler\nMushroom risotto and cr\u00e8me brule\nWhole sea-bass with passion fruit beurre-blanc and wilted greens\nSpaghetti (thick as worms) with thin sauce, canned green beans and apple sauce\nCorn dog, Fritos and ho-hos\nI should mention that the kitchen is an oddly unpredictable fare. So as to seem like any other hospital, they offer traditional, bland food at times, but at other times they have gourmet food, cooked by top chefs. Some people prefer the gourmet food, but the hospital food gives us an odd feeling of institutional affinity with elementary school children, prisoners and the mentally ill.\nOne of the most mysterious side effects of my disease is becoming randomly poisoned by food that I eat. I seem to develop food allergies that rise and fall within me. One day I can eat rice and feel fine and then the next week I eat a small amount of rice and it\u2019s like I\u2019ve eaten arsenic. There is vomiting and weakness and sometimes they have to pump my stomach.\nIf I didn\u2019t have these symptoms before I entered the hospital, I would think perhaps I was being poisoned by the night doctor.\nWe are all afraid of him. We think that perhaps he is a poisoner, like that famous case in England \u2014 the doctor who put elderly women to rest with heroin shots. He killed over 200 people. They say he wanted to be in ultimate control, to decide who lives and dies.\nWe have a warning system set up. If the night doctor ever comes into someone\u2019s room at night and offers them an injection they ring a little bell and one of the other patients comes into the room. Usually he withdraws the offer of medication when he sees he is being watched.\nActually poisoning is quite common in the medical field. There are nurses who kill their patients. I wonder if there are patients who kill their doctors.\nI recently requested a fourth kind of nurse. Everyone was surprised. They felt that the three nurse varieties pretty much covered the field.\nNo, I said, these nurses aren\u2019t giving me what I need. I want an I-don\u2019t-take-no-shit-from-anybody nurse. I want a woman from the heartland who has suffered and can look life straight in its shitty eye and still have some warmth in her. I want an I-won\u2019t-lie-to-you-here\u2019s-the-facts nurse.\nYes, they said, that kind of a nurse is necessary. Yes, they said, that is in fact the heart of nursing and they provided me with one.\nReally the kinds of relationships that I can have in the hospital are so much deeper and sweeter than in life that I don\u2019t want to ever leave. In addition to my rather fond relationships with the nurses, I form strange friendships with other patients. I am especially fond of ones who are dying.\nThey cannot die here, of course, but they can be very near death and they have a wonderful quality to them. We laugh about everything. As their hair falls out, their humor sharpens.\nWe could leave at any time really, if we wanted to, if we decided that our disease doesn\u2019t really exist or we invented a doctor that has a cure for it, but we like being here. You have a kind of disease that makes your skin more and more sensitive. That\u2019s why I followed you here. It means that the less and less that we touch, the more and more you feel.\nThat\u2019s why you wanted to fuck me in the bathroom before it was too late. Before that kind of touch would be too much. Our relationship has progressed backwards since then. We moved on to heavy petting, groping, tongue kissing, holding hands.\nNow it is enough sometimes to put my little finger at the tip of your earlobe. At night, when I sneak to you in your bed and touch you so quietly and gently that I won\u2019t damage any of your organs, I feel more alive than I ever have in my life.\nYou whisper in my ear, What is it about death that makes us so alive?\nI whisper back, I am touching you for the last time. Last time I touch your belly. Last time I touch your eyebrow. Last time I put your penis in my mouth, so gently, as if it will melt against my tongue.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

All about, stems grew up from the earth, pushed aside small stones in titters of growth. Smooth stones, worn young again by rain and rivers. They nestled with sighs into dirt made of the remnants of other, elder straw.\nLouder than the growing pains of my food, oh!, I heard those brass bells and clamors.\nA war was started, and I owned a fine sword. A well-made blade, thick enough for two weapons, forged atop a balance well-weighted by love.\nMy sword, stainless steel, machined in a Midwest factory, sold to me on a television shopping channel. So I practiced the arts of my land.\nWhen I practiced by sunrise with my sword in my field, dewdrops sang over its sharpness. I made tornadoes in the firmament, working through my forms.\n\u201cThis,\u201d I said to the stalks, \u201cso that you will have memories.\u201d\nThose blasts! Those slippery valves!\nSo much noise, I went to hide inside, went to my safest place, where I kept my sword. I laid there a moment, and then, I carried my sword out, to my anvil. There, I beat against my sword with my heaviest sledge, which felt pregnant with lead and load.\nMy sword broadened as if spilled milk and the cutting edge thinned. Yes, I was very tempted to cry, but I didn\u2019t. I kept myself as strong as I could possibly be with all that racket and parade in the air.\nOnce my sword had ripped storms through such air, but now we were all memory, too.\nIn the afternoon, the Army came to enlist me, wearing his medals, brandishing his own foil, far less fearsome than mine had been.\n\u201cWe need you,\u201d The Army said. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard of your sword. We\u2019ve heard it over the summer breeze and these cool, fall drafts.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a sword,\u201d I said. \u201cOnly a plowshare.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a shame. When you lose your strength, you lose your peace.\u201d\nThe Army left my house, and I walked again into my field, this time carrying with me my plow. I began to till for the next season, pushing aside this year\u2019s crop, though today was really too early for harvest, and planting time was long past.\nI plowed for sounds. Layers of earth broke over the share. As I struck them, pebbles clanged out their tiniest gunshots. The ground squealed and screeched.\nTurning the soil, I cast my weakest plants aside. Then, I pulled up my strongest, well-rooted crops with my bare hands, and they gave me pitiful, pithy screams in a friction we overcame together. Later, I would come along and pluck them up into a black plastic garbage bag, the detritus of my efforts.\nIf the Army had stayed into dinner, we would have eaten my stew, made mostly of unripened roots and shoots.\nI would have told him that killing gets done by more than swords, that there are so many weapons in any good, sweet home. Some loud, some quiet. Some aching for use, some content to rust.\nThere are differences in volume and desire as there are in swords, and there are no differences at all. There are differences of handles and handlers. Differences in chopsticks and knives. There are differences in parades and marches, differences in the purpose of a band in uniform, and differences in the staccato blats and quavers come from a row of trombones.\nAnd yet there are no differences at all. There is only war, and the memory of war, which is sometimes mistaken for peace.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Then he flung himself down on the patchwork corduroy pouf in the corner of the oversized living room. He listened to the music with his eyes closed, hands unconsciously finding the beat.\n*\nThe house had a pool. Of course it had a pool. John supposed that was in the rider now: a big house near LA with four to six bedrooms and a pool. And parking for a car to drive them to meetings with the record execs. As prisons went, at least this one allowed them to spread out. It was good not to be on top of each other for a bit.\nHe stepped out of his clothes and left them puddled on the cement deck behind him. Then he jumped into the shimmering blue water with his eyes closed.\n*\nIn one of the bedrooms, Paul sprawled across the quilted velvet bedspread and paged dispiritedly through the Freep. So many shows, so many galleries, so many shops advertised inside. Of course, he wouldn\u2019t be able to visit any of them. There wasn\u2019t time in the schedule to contact places and ask them to stay open extra hours, when the fans wouldn\u2019t be around to mob him. It was physically painful for Paul to know how much was going on in the world and yet be trapped inside the band\u2019s fame, unable to enjoy any of it. He lit his last joint and closed his eyes.\n*\nIn another bedroom, George noodled on his sitar, trying to remember the fingerings. It sounded wrong. It always sounded wrong these days. He fiddled with the tuning, ran through some scales again. Everything felt right until he started to play once more. He knew enough to hear the mistakes, but not enough to be able to avoid them. He closed his eyes, pushed out a deep breath, and began again.\n*\nRich chewed on the stub of a pencil, trying to put words down on a legal pad. He\u2019d listed a bunch of rhymes for \u201cyou,\u201d but he was having trouble getting the rhythm of the lines to scan. Songwriting was so much harder than Paul and John made it look.\nSomeone tapped on the front door. Rich didn\u2019t bother to move. The lads were around somewhere. Anyway, whoever had come, they weren\u2019t likely to be there for him.\nThe knock repeated.\n\u201cHey!\u201d Rich called. \u201cWe expectin\u2019 anyone?\u201d\nFrom somewhere in the house, Paul called back, \u201cIt\u2019s the drugs. The pot is here.\u201d\nRich waited for someone to come, but no one seemed inclined. Neil was the one who handled these sorts of transactions. He was the only one of them who carried cash, because he was the only one allowed outside. But Neil, if he was around, was sleeping or otherwise involved. Since the tour had gone off the rails, Neil was as tired of managing it as they were exhausted by playing it.\nThe knocking went on and on. Rich felt trapped. This tour had been a right nightmare, from the riot at the Manilla airport to the threats to burn their records in Alabama to the firecracker thrown against his drums in Memphis. The lads were frustrated and depressed and worn out and ready to go home. This break in LA wasn\u2019t long enough, then it was off to San Francisco for another stadium show, where no one could hear the music over the teenaged girls screaming. It was all so very disheartening.\nPaul came stomping down the stairs. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to answer it?\u201d\n\u201cNo money,\u201d Rich said forlornly.\nBy then Paul had opened the door. He froze in a posture so unnatural that Rich finally climbed out of the pouf to see who stood outside.\nThe girl on the porch was mouthwateringly pretty. She wore her hair coiling down her back in loose curls. Its color was a deep chestnut with a weird, shimmering red undertone. Her eyes were a striking shade of gray, almost lavender. Her figure was truly spectacular: swooping curves loosely wrapped in a purple crocheted dress. It looked like a shrug would send her dress cascading to the floor. She didn\u2019t seem confined by anything underneath it.\n\u201cWho\u2019s this, then?\u201d Rich asked over Paul\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cLorelei,\u201d Paul moaned. There was an iced terror in his tone that Rich had never heard before.\nHe stared from one to the other. \u201cWho?\u201d\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t met.\u201d The American girl held out her hand.\nRich reached out. When her hand closed on his, her palm felt hot, almost feverish, burning at the edge of pain. As soon as he tried to pull away, the sensation passed. She smiled for him, showing even white teeth in her generous mouth. He couldn\u2019t remember if he\u2019d ever met a girl so beautiful.\n\u201cLorelei?\u201d he repeated, tasting the name.\n\u201cYes.\u201d Amusement danced in her eyes. They really were a remarkable shade of purple. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d\n\u201cTell her no,\u201d Paul said. \u201cNo.\u201d\nRich caught a breath of her perfume, a heady, musky scent that swirled in his mind before settling in his groin. \u201cPlease come in,\u201d he echoed.\nShe stepped over the threshold of the rented house in ribboned sandals that twined up her calves. Somewhere, a low gong chimed. The hair on the back of Rich\u2019s neck stood up and he shivered.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s John?\u201d Lorelei asked.\nPaul was still staring at her in blank terror. Rich frowned, trying to figure out who the girl could be, what Paul\u2019s hang-up was. Finally, he remembered to answer her question. \u201cIn the pool.\u201d He waved toward the back of the house.\n\u201cThanks.\u201d She stepped between the two of them like she knew where she was headed. She dropped a lumpy macram\u00e9 shopping bag on the coffee table on her way out the sliding door. Rich watched her go, the pendulum of her hips like magic.\n\u201cWho is she?\u201d Rich asked again.\n\u201cTrouble,\u201d Paul finally managed to say. \u201cI\u2019ll fetch George.\u201d\n*\nJohn felt the splash of someone entering the water, but didn\u2019t open his eyes. He sat on the floor of the shallow end, head mere inches below the surface of the water, trying to apply the relaxation techniques George had told him about. Instead, John found himself extremely aware of someone swimming toward him. The currents swirled around him, tugging on his hair. All his good vibes washed away.\nHe opened his eyes angrily to squint at the girl coming at him. She also was starkers, a fact he registered a moment before he recognized her. He gasped, inhaling a mouthful of chlorinated water.\nWhile John flailed, choking, Lorelei grabbed his shoulder and hauled his head above the water. \u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d she soothed, stroking the hair back from his eyes. Eventually he coughed up the pool water, disgusted and furious.\n\u201cBloody hell, Lorelei,\u201d he growled. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cI work in L.A. now.\u201d Even with her hair plastered to her skull and glued in wet tendrils to her shoulders, she was still pretty as a Millais mermaid.\n\u201cStep up from Hamburg, then?\u201d\nShe laughed. \u201cAt least one.\u201d\nJohn changed the subject abruptly. \u201cIs it all over finally?\u201d he asked, more than half hoping.\n\u201cNot yet. You\u2019ve got a few more years to kill.\u201d\nThe lads came out onto the patio. Richie stared avidly at the naked girl in the pool. Paul was a shade of white like cheese that had gone off. George, though \u2026 George was not a bit surprised to see her.\n\u201cDid you call her, then?\u201d John demanded.\n\u201cYeah. We need to renegotiate,\u201d George said. \u201cEveryone agrees we can\u2019t go on as we are.\u201d\nNo one had the heart to dispute that.\n\u201cWho\u2019s hungry?\u201d Lorelei asked brightly. \u201cI brought takeout from Kolkata.\u201d\n*\nOnce she\u2019d shimmied into her dress again and John had put on his trousers, they gathered around the dining room table, a huge slab of redwood tree polished to a gloss. Lorelei set out cardboard boxes from her macram\u00e9 shopping bag. The scent of exotic spices filled the room.\n\u201cStill like it hot?\u201d she asked Paul, but he wouldn\u2019t meet her eyes.\nRich retrieved plates and silverware from the kitchen. Lorelei served them saffron rice and vegetable korma, chana masala and tofu curry.\nNo one seemed inclined to take the chair next to her, so George did. \u201cThank you for coming,\u201d he told her as he tucked into the food. He appreciated that she\u2019d chosen vegetarian, just for him.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you called her,\u201d Paul said quietly, not touching his plate.\n\u201cWe need her help,\u201d George argued. \u201cThey\u2019ll kill us if we go on as we have been.\u201d\nNo one seemed eager to dispute that. The girl watched them eat and picked daintily at her own food.\nShe was gazing at John when she said, \u201cMore popular than Jesus, huh?\u201d\nJohn coughed. Rich patted him on the back, but John shrugged his hand away.\n\u201cWere you trying to get yourself crucified?\u201d she asked.\nGeorge sighed. He was exhausted by listening to John prevaricate. DJs, the press, venue managers: everyone had been asking John what he\u2019d meant by that observation, when it passed without fuss months ago after its original publication in England. The Americans just couldn\u2019t get enough of chewing it over. Then again, Lorelei wasn\u2019t really American, was she? She had certainly mastered the accent.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true in England,\u201d Rich said defensively. \u201cThe kids worship us there.\u201d\nLorelei chuckled. In that instant, George saw through her disguise. When they\u2019d met in Hamburg, she\u2019d seemed simply an unusually pretty older girl. Somehow, she looked younger now. It was all an illusion, George knew. Anyway, in Hamburg they\u2019d been drunk all the time and wound up on pills. No wonder they couldn\u2019t see straight.\nNow, though, he could see the sharp tips of her horns poking through the dense mane of her weird-colored hair. He could see the carnivorous serrations of her teeth. Over her shoulders twitched the black shadow of wings. She met George\u2019s eyes. Despite himself, despite the warm LA afternoon, he shivered as if someone had walked over his grave.\n\u201cYou wanted to be the biggest band in the world,\u201d she told George. \u201cYou wanted to be millionaires.\u201d\nShe reminded John, \u201cYou wanted out of the working class, to travel the world. To have your ideas taken seriously.\u201d\nShe looked to Paul. \u201cYou wanted to write songs that made the world happy.\u201d\nShe poured herself a full glass of the rich red wine she\u2019d brought, toasted them, then asked, \u201cHave any of those things failed to happen? Have I failed to live up to our bargain in any way?\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you have to do with it, then?\u201d Rich asked.\nLorelei\u2019s predatory gaze swung to him. George wanted to shield his friend, distract her, but he had called this meeting, knowing it would strip away the older man\u2019s innocence. Rich would never see them the same after this. George felt sick to his bones.\n\u201cI\u2019m the muse,\u201d Lorelei teased. \u201cI made it all happen.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lie,\u201d Paul argued miserably. \u201cYou\u2019re no muse. You\u2019re the devil.\u201d\n\u201cA devil,\u201d Lorelei corrected. \u201cYour devil.\u201d\n\u201cWe talked to the label,\u201d George explained, \u201cbut they say we can never stop touring. Bands always tour, they say. We need to go out to support the albums. We owe it to the fans.\u201d He poured himself a glass of her wine. \u201cSeriously, it\u2019s getting dangerous out there. Can you fix things for us?\u201d\nLorelei smiled again, looking much like a cat. \u201cWhich things?\u201d\n\u201cNo more touring,\u201d George started, but John cut him off.\n\u201cThe screaming is going to drive us deaf as Beethoven.\u201d\nPaul added, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of writing songs that no one can hear?\u201d\n\u201cThe devil?\u201d Rich echoed.\n\u201cShut it,\u201d John snapped. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a say in this.\u201d\nLorelei sipped her wine, watching them. \u201cYou\u2019ve already sold me your souls, my loves. You\u2019ve already enjoyed the things you bargained for. How can I help it if you loathe what you thought you wanted?\u201d\n\u201cFix it,\u201d John snarled. \u201cPaul\u2019s got an idea for an album that we\u2019ll never be able to play live. We can write more songs if we don\u2019t have to worry about playing them on two guitars and a bass. We can\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSorry, boys.\u201d She honestly sounded like she might be. Just like a record company exec, though, she knew how to spin her regrets. \u201cI\u2019m hearing a lot about what I can do for you \u2014 and not so much about what you can do for me.\u201d\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Rich said, staring at his bandmates. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d\n\u201cWe were kids,\u201d George explained. \u201cShe started hanging around, making us a lot of promises.\u201d\n\u201cIt was a lark,\u201d John added. \u201cSelling our souls for fame and fortune, like Robert Johnson at the crossroads. I didn\u2019t believe in souls and all that rubbish.\u201d\n\u201cI did.\u201d Paul started to weep. \u201cI do.\u201d He pushed his plate away and sobbed into his arms on the table.\n\u201cAh, Christ,\u201d John said. \u201cStop acting like a child, son. We\u2019re in this together. All except Richie.\u201d\nRich snatched Lorelei\u2019s bottle of wine and poured himself a glass. \u201cYou\u2019re all mental,\u201d he accused. \u201cThis is a great joke, innit?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not, though,\u201d Paul groaned. Lorelei got up and went into the bathroom. She returned with a box of tissues that she set in front of Paul.\nWhen she took her seat again, Lorelei said, \u201cHere\u2019s the deal: I will arrange it with your labels, both here and in England. The Beatles can continue to be the biggest band in the world. More popular than Jesus. You can work from home, from the studio, from wherever you like, as long as the songs get written and the music recorded. I like you boys. I want to keep you around.\u201d\n\u201cAt what cost?\u201d John asked. He poured wine for himself and Paul.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve only got one thing left that I want,\u201d Lorelei answered. She gave them a moment to consider what it might be, then added, \u201cI want to have the whole set.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Paul told Rich. \u201cDon\u2019t do it, man. We made this mistake. We\u2019ll find a way to fix it.\u201d\n\u201cWill you?\u201d Lorelei wondered.\nJohn said nothing, at a loss for words for a change. Anger rattled through him, searching for an outlet.\nHating himself, George met Rich\u2019s gaze. \u201cI\u2019m truly sorry, mate. It\u2019s all up to you.\u201d\n*\nRich didn\u2019t realize he was walking out of the negotiation until he found himself out on the patio. The sun had set while they\u2019d eaten dinner. Six palm trees stood like sentinels beyond the pool. Between the trees, he could see the lights of the city coming on across the plain below. In the afterglow, Los Angeles was beautiful, half magical, and so very tempting. He\u2019d never seen it except from the back of a car as they were driven to the Hollywood Bowl or a record company meeting. What would it be like to really live in the world again?\nHe\u2019d never questioned the band\u2019s success before. Of course it was because the lads were geniuses. They pushed themselves hard: studying poetry, learning new instruments, stretching and striving and breaking new ground, teaching the world to sing along. It was easy to believe they\u2019d earned their immense fame because they worked so goddamned hard.\nHe knew, because he wasn\u2019t stupid, that the band was on the verge of splitting up. George and Patti wanted to study with Ravi Shankar and the Maharishi. John wanted to spend time in bed, surrounded by books, stuffing his brain with all the things he\u2019d missed in art school. Paul wanted to meet people and have real conversations about art and culture and the future\u2026\nAnd all Rich wanted was to be part of it. Not to be left behind. Not to have to scramble to find another gig when this one imploded from the pressures of two albums a year and a grueling world tour in between. He just wanted to be an equal member of the most popular band the world had ever known.\nHe turned to find Lorelei watching him from the shadows by the pool. Her eyes had gone lambent in the twilight, reflective as a wild animal\u2019s.\n\u201cWell, Mr. Starkey?\u201d she purred. \u201cDo we have a deal?\u201d\n\u201cAye. I\u2019ll sign whatever your contract or whatever it is. But I want to make it with you first.\u201d\n\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d say that.\u201d Even in the darkness, he could hear the smile in her voice.\n\u201cThey all have, haven\u2019t they?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard stories of raunchy old Hamburg.\u201d\n\u201cAye. I\u2019ve also heard about the night they burned the club down.\u201d\n\u201cNot all about it,\u201d she promised.\nLorelei stepped out of the shadows. She\u2019d dropped the pretense of humanity now. The crocheted dress really did come off with a shrug. Her luxurious crimson skin was hot to Rich\u2019s touch. She leaned forward to unfurl her pointed tongue into his mouth.\nAs she kissed him, Rich could not have been more certain he\u2019d made the right choice.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

At first, Tennessee thought that she must\u2019ve been a large dog; a second later he saw that it was a human body, covered in something.\nHis reactions just barely saved her. He veered left and banked hard, but not hard enough to throw his car into a spin.\nHe stopped some hundred feet down the road and left the car idling on the shoulder. It was dusk, and if he hadn\u2019t known it was a body he might\u2019ve mistaken it for a pile of leaves, or a trash bag someone had dumped.\nHe thought about searching through his back seat for his flashlight, but didn\u2019t. There was still just enough light to see by without one.\nWalking down the road he noted how silent this stretch of country was. All that bordered this minor highway were some old brittle fence posts held together by rusted barbwire. The fence was so worn away that he wondered if this land was used for ranching anymore.\nWhen he reached her body it took him a few seconds to tell which way around she was lying. She was curled up naked with a pile of some sort of hair or fabric covering most of her body and half of her face. Leaves and small pieces of bark adorned her hair.\nAt first, he thought that she must\u2019ve been wearing an old fur coat, the sort that they used to make back in the \u201970s which looked more like dog hair than anything else.\nHe reached down and brushed some of the twigs and leaves off of her face and saw that it was a young girl, no older than nineteen or twenty.\nShe was attractive, but she didn\u2019t have a perfect face. Her nose was a little too long, her lips a little too mellow, her cheeks too supple. He noticed all of these minor imperfections in just one moment.\nThere was something around her neck, a black leather string and a piece of metal, engraved with what appeared to be a tree.\nYggdrasil.\nWhen she moved Tennessee jumped back a good foot. He hadn\u2019t even thought to check if she was breathing.\nHe looked down as she turned herself onto her side and looked up.\n\u201cHola,\u201d she said, and he noticed that her hair was long and dark and straight as could be.\n\u201cYou alright? Estas Buena?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, sure. Hey, can you give me a lift outta here?\u201d\nShe said softly as she rose up onto her feet. Whatever had covered her turned out to be no more solid than dust. It fell softly apart into a cloud of fur, leaves and twigs as she got to her feet.\nShe looked at Tennessee and smiled. It didn\u2019t seem to bother her that she was naked.\nHe looked away.\n\u201cI can get you some clothes \u2014 my car\u2019s just right down here.\u201d\nHe glanced back once to check that she had followed.\n\u201cHere\u2019s some pants.\u201d Tennessee handed her a pair of his worn out Wrangler jeans from out of his trunk.\n\u201cOh groovy, boot cut. Didn\u2019t know Wrangler was still in business.\u201d\n\u201cHad these four maybe five years. They\u2019ll fit you. Just have to roll the pant legs up a bit.\u201d\nTennessee felt her take the jeans. He then pulled out a t-shirt, white cotton Fruit of the Loom, and held it out to her with his head diverted. He listened to her pull the jeans up, then he felt her take the shirt.\nWhen he was sure she was clothed he looked at her. She stared back, but he couldn\u2019t see her eyes. It had gotten too dark.\n\u201cYou alright?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, fine as can be.\u201d\n\u201cWhat you doing lying on the side of the road? You know I near about took your head off.\u201d\n\u201cCan you take me south, along this road?\u201d\n\u201cYou in trouble?\u201d\n\u201cNo, not really.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Not really,'\u201d He repeated.\n\u201cSo, can I get a ride with you or not?\u201d\nTennessee thought on this for a second. \u201cI\u2019m going as far as Alamogordo tonight, you headed that\u2019a way?\u201d\n\u201cThat way\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d\nHe smiled in the darkness. \u201cWell, get in then.\u201d\nTennessee wasted no time getting back on the road. He didn\u2019t want some big eighteen wheeler to come barreling along and knock them into the middle of next week.\n\u201cI got a few cans of Pepsi in the back. Got \u2019em chilled if you want one.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m good.\u201d\n\u201cWell, let me know if you change your mind.\u201d\n\u201cWill do, partner.\u201d\n\u201cBy the way, name\u2019s Tennessee.\u201d\nShe gave the dashboard and the seat beside her a quick look-over.\n\u201cHey, man, you got any tapes?\u201d\n\u201cTapes?\u201d\n\u201cCassette tapes. To play.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I sure don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have any tapes?\u201d\n\u201cMy tape player\u2019s broke. Plays everything at twice the normal speed.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nShe opened the glove compartment, which Tennessee was sure was had been locked.\n\u201cHey, close that up.\u201d His voice was agitated.\nInside the glove compartment was a revolver.\n\u201cIs that a Colt Peacemaker?\u201d\n\u201cYou know something about guns?\u201d\n\u201cA little.\u201d\n\u201cWell, then you ought to know to close that glove compartment back on up.\u201d\nShe looked at him, then put the gun away.\n\u201cSo, what you called?\u201d\n\u201cIsi.\u201d\n\u201cIsi?\u201d\n\u201cKohana.\u201d\n\u201cIsi Kohana?\u201d\n\u201cMoki, Ahawi, Hexaka.\u201d\nTennessee glanced over at her.\n\u201cAll those yours, huh?\u201d He waited a few seconds for an answer. \u201cWell, which one you want me to call you by?\u201d\n\u201cSince there\u2019s only two of us, we don\u2019t really need designations, do we?\u201d\n\u201cWere any of those your real name? Some of them sounded Indian.\u201d\nShe propped her legs up on the dashboard in front of her.\n\u201cYou know, I didn\u2019t have to take you anywhere. Could\u2019ve just left you back there. So your might try being a bit friendlier.\u201d\n\u201cOK.\u201d\n\u201cWell, what\u2019s your real name?\u201d\n\u201cWhy you need to know?\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you want me to know?\u201d\n\u201cNo reason to.\u201d\n\u201cOther than the fact that you and I are here in this car together, and if I\u2019m gonna talk to you I\u2019d like to know what to call you.\u201d\n\u201cYou could just say, \u2018hey,\u2019 and I\u2019d know you were speaking to me. Names are superfluous in this situation.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe, but names make people feel more familiar with one another.\u201d\n\u201cDo they? What about when you\u2019re at the bank and the bank clerk uses your name because it\u2019s store policy. They do that to make you feel more like an individual, like the bank really knows you and cares about you, but I don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not a bank clerk.\u201d Tennessee replied, and he immediately felt like it wasn\u2019t the wittiest thing he could have come back with.\n\u201cIt used to be that you only told your name to a handful of people who were really close to you. Names used to be very important. They weren\u2019t just designations.\u201d\n\u201cNames\u2019 still are important.\u201d\n\u201cDo you feel like a Tennessee?\u201d\n\u201cNever gave it any thought.\u201d\nShe leaned back in her seat, and the two drove in silence for a few minutes.\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s the gun for?\u201d\nTennessee glanced over at the girl. \u201cWhat do you mean what\u2019s the gun for? What do you think it\u2019s for?\u201d\n\u201cSo, you believe in guns, huh?\u201d\n\u201cI believe in covering my ass.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it takes a gun to do it.\u201d\n\u201cSometimes.\u201d\nShe looked over at Tennessee and studied him for a moment. He felt a bit uncomfortable knowing that she was quietly looking at him.\n\u201cSo, what do you do?\u201d\n\u201cAs little as possible,\u201d he replied.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s as little as possible?\u201d\n\u201cMore than I\u2019d like to be doing.\u201d\n\u201cYour job involve using a gun?\u201d\n\u201cYou always ask so many questions?\u201d\n\u201cI figured we might as well get familiar with one another. We got time to kill.\u201d\nTennessee tried not to smile, but he did.\n\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d He shot her a glance.\n\u201cI do a lot of traveling. And eating. And sleeping.\u201d\n\u201cI meant job-wise.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t really got a job.\u201d\n\u201cYou just hitching across the country?\u201d\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t hitched until now.\u201d\n\u201cWhat were you doing back there with no clothes on? Someone leave you like that? You on any drugs?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s on this radio?\u201d She spoke more to herself than him as she tried to turn it on.\nThere was loud static and Tennessee quickly reached across and turned the volume down.\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t gonna find much out here,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s got to be something.\u201d\nThe first station she came across was playing salsa. The girl listened to it for a few seconds then continued to turn the knob.\nThe next station was a Christian station.\n\u201d \u2026 and you got to know that the Word is the same today as it was in Paul\u2019s time, as it was in Abraham\u2019s time, as it was in the beginning of time, and it\u2019ll be the same tomorrow and the next day on until the end of time, it doesn\u2019t change, mankind changes, our laws and societies and all that change, but the Word is constant \u2026 \u201c\n\u201cYou gonna keep listening to that?\u201d\nThe girl looked over at Tennessee and changed the channel until it came back around to the Salsa music. She left it there and began to nod her head and tap her feet to the rhythm of the tuba.\n\u201cThink I may have liked the preaching better.\u201d\nShe smiled and kept right on tapping her feet.\nTen minutes later Tennessee pulled off at a truck stop in Vaughn.\n\u201cYou hungry?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll buy you a meal.\u201d\n\u201cOK.\u201d\n\u201cSo, you are hungry?\u201d\n\u201cA little.\u201d\nTennessee picked out a booth next to one of the front windows.\n\u201cGet as much as you\u2019d like.\u201d He watched her look over the menu. \u201cHell, get the t-bone special if you like.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t eat t-bone.\u201d\n\u201cWell, get what you like.\u201d\nTennessee began to look over his menu and wonder what the soup of the day would be. The waitress came over and took a longer-than-usual look at the girl. Her name tag read \u201cNancy.\u201d\n\u201cWell, what can I get for you two?\u201d\n\u201cHowdy, Nancy.\u201d The girl bounced up and down and smiled like Nancy was an old friend that she hadn\u2019t seen in years.\nNancy didn\u2019t know quite how to take the girl\u2019s enthusiasm.\nThey both ordered and waited in silence for the food to come out. Tennessee thought about asking her again how she ended up on the side of that road but then thought against it.\nIn pretty much every booth there was a small jukebox; for a quarter you could play a song or for a dollar you could play five.\nThe girl flipped though the available music options and stopped at the Rolling Stones greatest hits album.\n\u201cHey, can I have a quarter?\u201d She smiled over at Tennessee, and he was once again struck by how attractive she looked, even in a men\u2019s large white t-shirt that hid any vestige of her womanhood.\n\u201cSure.\u201d\nHe handed her a quarter and she immediately popped it into the jukebox. Ten seconds later \u201cSympathy for the Devil\u201d started to play.\n\u201cHere\u2019s your coffee and your water. You take milk with yours?\u201d The waitress placed his mug in front of him.\n\u201cI take milk, but I don\u2019t take that stuff that comes in those little plastic packages.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all we got, sir.\u201d\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll pass on the milk.\u201d\nThe waitress left, but not before taking another disapproving look at the girl. She thought about saying something about her bare feet, but then decided not to.\nThe girl looked at Tennessee suddenly. \u201cDoes something about my appearance bother you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No. Why would you ask that?\u201d\n\u201cYou never look at me, and when you do you only do so for a split second.\u201d\n\u201cDo I?\u201d\n\u201cYes, you do.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you don\u2019t want me staring at you do you?\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind, if that\u2019s what you wanted to do.\u201d\n\u201cYes, you would. You don\u2019t want some man like me staring at you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if I stared at you?\u201d\n\u201cStare all you like. Don\u2019t know why you\u2019d want to, but it wouldn\u2019t bother me none.\u201d\nThe waitress arrived with the food and put down Tennessee\u2019s and then the girl\u2019s.\nTennessee immediately began to cut into his pork chop. He found his grits to be piping hot but his eggs were cold, so he mixed the two together.\n\u201cSo, Tennessee, what kind of work you involved in?\u201d\nHe looked up at her and slowly chewed his bite of egg and toast.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll make you a deal. I\u2019ll tell you what I do if you tell me what you were doing laying on the side of the road up there.\u201d\nThe girl was silent for a few seconds. \u201cI was sleeping.\u201d\nTennessee stared at her as he cut off another piece of his pork chop.\n\u201cSleeping?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, now it\u2019s your turn.\u201d\n\u201cYou think that\u2019s supposed to be an answer? Sleeping?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I was doing.\u201d\n\u201cOK, well, why were you sleeping on the road, and what happened to your clothes?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have any.\u201d\nTennessee took a swig of his coffee.\n\u201cWell, damn if that ain\u2019t some sorry shit.\u201d He took another swig. \u201cAnd it don\u2019t get no better either.\u201d\nThe girl leaned forward and for the first time Tennessee\u2019s baggy t-shirt revealed the outline of her breasts.\n\u201cDo you use that gun in your work?\u201d\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t answered my question yet.\u201d\n\u201cYes I have. Both of them.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019d you come to be there, a dozen miles from anywhere?\u201d\n\u201cI ran.\u201d\n\u201cWith no clothes on?\u201d\nShe looked away.\nTennessee finished his meal and pushed it to one side. He then proceeded to chug his coffee.\n\u201cYou hardly touched your plate.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t normally eat food like this.\u201d\n\u201cFood like what?\u201d\nShe was silent.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know when you gonna get a chance to eat again, so you should try to eat some of what you got in front of you.\u201d\nShe looked out the window. Tennessee gazed at her and pondered his best course of action. He didn\u2019t know if he could just drive her around, sit her down somewhere else and let her go off on her own.\n\u201cLook,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cI\u2019m leaving this restaurant, and leaving you here, unless you tell me who you are and what you were doing out there all by yourself in the state you were in.\u201d\n\u201cLeave me here?\u201d She suddenly appeared frightened. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna leave me?\u201d\n\u201cI said if you don\u2019t \u2026 \u201c\n\u201cWhy would you leave me here? Don\u2019t leave me, not now. I need to make it further south.\u201d\n\u201cYou in trouble?\u201d\n\u201cAre you gonna leave me here?\u201d\nShe appeared smaller, paler, her hands seem to shake. She looked out the window again. A new moon was out. Everything was dark but the parking lot.\n\u201cIf you need help then you need to tell me what trouble you\u2019re in, and maybe I can figure something out.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to get out of here.\u201d\n\u201cWell, just let me go pay.\u201d\nHe went to the till and paid as he kept his eyes on the girl. He had seen people on all types of crazy drugs do all types of crazy things. He\u2019d also seen people who were just plain crazy doing crazy things, and when this girl\u2019s mood shifted he began to wonder was it a drug thing or was she just a little bit off balance mentally.\nHe looked at her sitting still in her seat and for a moment he felt a great sense of pity \u2014 that and a bit of love.\nWhen they got back on the road they barely spoke. She turned on the radio again and found a station that didn\u2019t play salsa or preachers. It played Jimi Hendrix.\n\u201cHow far south you going?\u201d\n\u201cNot sure. All the way maybe.\u201d\n\u201cAll the way? What, you mean Mexico?\u201d\n\u201cOr Patagonia.\u201d\nTennessee smiled. He was glad to see some of the spunk return to her voice. Her getting scared back in the dinner had troubled something in him.\nIt didn\u2019t seem to him like she was on drugs or had recently been on drugs, and she didn\u2019t seem crazy either, so he thought there might just be someone after her.\n\u201cI can help you, you know?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d\n\u201cI mean, it don\u2019t matter what type of trouble you\u2019re in, the law, an old boyfriend, someone you owe money to, whatever, I can help.\u201d\n\u201cIs that what you do, you help people?\u201d\n\u201cSometimes.\u201d\n\u201cWhen\u2019s sometimes?\u201d\n\u201cNot as often as I\u2019d like it to be.\u201d\n\u201cSee, you\u2019re just as shit at answering questions as I am.\u201d\nTennessee laughed.\n\u201cYeah, I guess so.\u201d\n\u201cSo, what do you do when you\u2019re not helping people?\u201d\nTennessee glanced over at her and then back at the night road. Everything was still as could be.\n\u201cI help people recover things.\u201d\n\u201cSuch as?\u201d\n\u201cSuch as their property.\u201d\n\u201cI thought the police did that.\u201d\nTennessee was quiet for a moment.\n\u201cI specialize in things the police don\u2019t recover.\u201d\n\u201cWere you in the army?\u201d\nTennessee glanced over at the girl.\n\u201cWhat makes you think I was in the army?\u201d\n\u201cYou were, weren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I was.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think of war?\u201d\n\u201cI think it don\u2019t pay enough.\u201d\n\u201cIf it didn\u2019t pay enough there wouldn\u2019t be any war, would there?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right about that. But it didn\u2019t pay me enough.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have any problems with it other than the pay scale?\u201d\nTennessee looked over at the girl then back at the road.\n\u201cWell, that and the fact that I didn\u2019t really have any stake in the whole thing.\u201d\n\u201cOther than your life.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I was pretty sure I wasn\u2019t gonna die or I wouldn\u2019t have been there.\u201d\n\u201cSo, what about the current job? You got a stake in it?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe you should find a different job.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you know about jobs? You ever worked one?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, while you were in college?\u201d\n\u201cI never went to college.\u201d\n\u201cSo, what\u2019d you do?\u201d\n\u201cI was a guide.\u201d\n\u201cA guide? Like a white water rafting guide?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cA tour guide?\u201d\nThe girl was quiet for a few seconds.\n\u201cI guided people. Helped them along. Got them to where they needed to be going.\u201d\nTennessee thought this answer over.\n\u201cYou mean you took people places, or you mean you helped them through tough times?\u201d\n\u201cBoth.\u201d\n\u201cSo, you were a social worker or something?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I was a guide.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like you were a social worker.\u201d\n\u201cSocial workers don\u2019t help you to find your soul\u2019s purpose. At most they stop you from abusing your children.\u201d\n\u201cYour soul\u2019s purpose, huh? Sounds like some of that new age stuff.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not new.\u201d\n\u201cSo why\u2019d you quit?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really quit.\u201d\n\u201cYou said earlier that you didn\u2019t have a job.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t quit. It just got to the point where I wasn\u2019t much use anymore.\u201d\n\u201cWhat you mean?\u201d\n\u201cTimes change. I didn\u2019t keep up.\u201d\nTennessee laughed at this. It wasn\u2019t because what she said was funny. It was because it didn\u2019t make much sense to him.\n\u201cTimes ain\u2019t changed that much, not in your lifetime. In my lifetime, yeah, but not so much as you\u2019d think.\u201d\nThe girl didn\u2019t respond. She pushed her seat back, reclined it as far as it would go, and laid back in it.\nThe two were quiet for some time as the station they were listening to turned to static. The girl leaned forward and turned the knob around three or four times, but the radio couldn\u2019t pick up anything. She turned it off and laid back in her seat.\nThey passed a sign which warned them of deer crossing, and a few minutes past this sign they came across one for the town of Oscuro, New Mexico, \u201cPopulation 9.\u201d\nA mile past this tiny hamlet, they came across a car accident. Two cars appeared to have collided in the middle of the road. Tennessee slowed down as he approached the wreck.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened here?\u201d he whispered to himself.\nThe girl jerked awake and sat upright. She pulled her seatback forward.\n\u201cI think we got a head-on collision,\u201d Tennessee said and glanced over at the girl.\nShe was staring out the window.\nTennessee stopped the car about forty feet from the accident. He took a few seconds to take it all in.\nThe first car was turned perpendicular to the road, and all he could make out of the second car was its front bumper and grill which were slightly crumbled. Steam was still rising up from underneath the hood.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see nobody.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t either.\u201d She said.\nTennessee looked again for any movement or any bodies in the first car, but there was nothing moving and no one visible.\nSomething about the accident didn\u2019t set right with Tennessee.\n\u201cI\u2019ll go take a look.\u201d He said as he reached over and took his Colt Peacemaker from the glove compartment.\nHe looked at the girl. \u201cDon\u2019t say nothing.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to.\u201d\n\u201cAnd stay in here.\u201d\nThe girl nodded. She looked very worried, as worried as she had been at the dinner.\nTennessee left his lights on, and when he stepped out of his car he was amazed by the darkness. There was no moon, only starlight.\nHe waited for his eyes to adjust and placed his Colt loosely in his belt.\nHe could hear an owl call out and one of the car\u2019s engine steam, but there were no other sounds.\nThere was no one visible in either car.\nTennessee stepped out from behind his car door and began to walk slowly towards the wreck. The whole thing looked odd to him. Something wasn\u2019t right.\nAs he neared the accident he got a better view of the second vehicle and saw something he should\u2019ve noticed before he stepped out of his car. Both of the automobiles that he was looking at were the same make and model. They were both black, late-\u201990s BMWs.\nHe glanced to his left and noticed that there was a steep ditch on either side of the road.\nTennessee stopped and raised his pistol. \u201cYou need to just back your ass up out of this one. You might be good as dead already, but you might get lucky.\u201d\nHis instincts told him to run, and he always trusted his instincts.\nHe was half a second away from bolting when he noticed something pass in front of the headlights.\nHe turned and pointed his pistol into the blinding lights.\nIn front of his car where four figures, one of which he knew was the girl. She was being held by one of the other figures, the one in the middle.\n\u201cHold your fire, Mr. McClain.\u201d A voice called out. \u201cWe ain\u2019t got no business with you.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019re you?\u201d Tennessee asked as he held his hand up against the light.\n\u201cNo one in particular. Now if you\u2019d just place your gun on the ground and step back, then we can be on our way, and so can you.\u201d\nTennessee couldn\u2019t tell if they were pointing anything his way, but he figured they were.\nHe figured he could take out two of them before they shot him, but that\u2019s the best he could do.\nEven worse, he didn\u2019t know how many more were out of sight, off to either side or right behind him.\n\u201cWhat you want with that girl?\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want her, Mr. McClain, we\u2019re just escorts.\u201d\n\u201cWho are these men? You know \u2019em?\u201d he called to the girl and tried to make out her face.\nHe could hear her try to respond, but her voice was muffled.\n\u201cHey, let the girl talk.\u201d\n\u201cYou really ain\u2019t in a position to make any demands, Mr. McClain.\u201d\n\u201cCall me Tennessee would you?\u201d\n\u201cI really do suggest that you lower your gun and place it on the ground.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what if I don\u2019t feel like it?\u201d\n\u201cThen you know what will happen.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but do you know what will happen?\u201d\nTennessee heard a hammer cock.\n\u201cLast chance, lower your gun and place it on the ground.\u201d\n\u201cFine. Alright.\u201d Tennessee made like he was about to give his gun up, and then he took a flying leap towards the ditch to his right.\nThere was a shotgun blast and he felt some of the shot pelt his rear and his left thigh.\nAs soon as he landed in the ditch he began running towards the light, trying to stay as low as he could.\nThere was another shot and Tennessee felt something sting his back.\nHe leapt forward and landed face up with his gun pointed out in front of him. One of the men was already coming over the edge of the ditch and Tennessee fired and hit him in the face. The man fell forward and landed at Tennessee\u2019s feet.\nA second man fired at him, and Tennessee fired back and hit him in the arm. The man retreated. Tennessee got up and backed further away from the glow of his car headlights.\nHe took a second to feel his hip and thigh. He pulled his hand back and it was wet with blood.\nTennessee kept moving until he was sure he was behind his car, and then he looked up and took a peek. He saw one figure, the one holding the girl.\nTennessee hunkered down.\nHe heard something fly over head and land beside him. The metal on rock sound was unmistakable.\n\u201cGrenades?\u201d\nHe picked himself up and bolted out of the ditch. He ran for the back of his car as someone fired a shot. He stopped just short of his vehicle, got down on his stomach and looked under it.\nTennessee could see the shadows of someone\u2019s feet. He fired, heard a man scream and then saw him hit the pavement.\nTennessee shot him two more times; the man stopped screaming.\nHe got up and stood with his gun aimed at the head of the last man.\n\u201cNot bad,\u201d the man said.\n\u201cYou got anyone left?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I got a knife up against this girl\u2019s jugular.\u201d\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t no damn grenade was it?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but it got you out of that ditch, didn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cBack away from the girl.\u201d\n\u201cYou still don\u2019t understand the situation you\u2019re in, do you?\u201d\n\u201cI understand enough.\u201d\n\u201cIf you did, then you\u2019d lower your gun and run like hell back the way you came.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve had about enough of your mouth. Let the girl go, or by God I\u2019ll shoot you dead.\u201d\n\u201cTry it.\u201d\nTennessee fired and hit the man in his face. The man fell backwards.\nHe took a look around, and rushed forward towards the girl.\n\u201cGet out of those headlights.\u201d He said as he pulled her towards him. Just then he noticed the man he had just shot stand up as casual as anything.\nTennessee looked at the man and could see blood leaking out of a hole in his cheek. In the head lights the blood looked black.\n\u201cMust\u2019ve just clipped him.\u201d Tennessee thought as he raised his gun and shot the man in the chest. The man jerked slightly, but kept standing. He moved forward as quick as anything and knocked Tennessee\u2019s gun out of his hand and grabbed his throat.\nTennessee tried to wrestle the man\u2019s hand off his throat, but it was like trying to bend a piece of steel.\n\u201cI told you that you don\u2019t understand the situation you\u2019re in.\u201d\nThe man lifted Tennessee off the ground and then dropped him.\nTennessee pulled the bowie knife out of his boot and came back at the man, who deflected his attack and threw him back to the ground.\nIn the next second the man was on top of Tennessee. He hissed and went for Tennessee\u2019s throat with his teeth. Tennessee grabbed his face, tried to push it back, but it was no use.\nThen the man stopped. The girl was on his back pulling at his hair and hitting at his head. The man growled and swiped at the girl.\nTennessee took this opportunity to stick his knife into the side of the man\u2019s neck. The man stood up and howled. The girl was tossed to the ground.\nTennessee picked himself up and watched as the man pulled the knife out of his neck which immediately began to spew blood. The man pressed his other hand against the wound and stared at Tennessee.\nHe smiled and his teeth glowed like burning white florescent bulbs.\nTennessee looked down to see the first man\u2019s shotgun lying by the edge of the road. It was only ten feet from where he was standing.\nTennessee ran over and picked the shotgun up. He turned around in time to see the man limping towards him. The man was still holding his neck with one hand and brandishing the knife with the other.\nTennessee cocked the shotgun and aimed it.\nHis first shot took off most of the man\u2019s face. The man continued blindly forward. Tennessee walked closer and fired again. The second shot hit him in the neck. The man paused and then his head flopped to one side. It was held on by a bit of bone and muscle.\nTennessee walked up to him and kicked him over. He proceeded to unload two more shots into the man\u2019s face and began to reload.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s dead.\u201d The girl said.\n\u201cHe sure as shit oughta be.\u201d\n\u201cHow are you?\u201d\nTennessee could feel his left leg stiffening up on him. He could also feel a sharp pain in his back, and his shirt felt wet and was matted to his skin.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen men on drugs get shot two or three times and not notice, and I\u2019ve seen \u2019em appear to have superhuman strength, but I sure as hell ain\u2019t ever seen anything like what I just witnessed.\u201d\nTennessee slumped down against the hood of his car. He was getting light headed, and he realized that he must be loosing more blood than he thought.\n\u201cI got a first aid kit in the back,\u201d Tennessee said as he got himself seated on the road next to his car. He leaned back against his wheel and took a look around. \u201cIf anyone else was hiding they\u2019d a come out long before now.\u201d\n\u201cHere,\u201d the girl said and Tennessee looked over to see that the girl had the kit open. She was cutting his jeans open and using a bottle of water to wash the blood away.\n\u201cCheck my back.\u201d\nShe did.\n\u201cHow\u2019s it look?\u201d\n\u201cNot much better than your leg.\u201d\n\u201cSee if you can get some of the bleeding stopped. We\u2019re gonna have to backtrack up to Vaughn.\u201d\nThe girl nodded.\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cI was the one that was supposed to be helping you. Showing you the way. Getting you through danger.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s my job. Course you never tried to find me. Didn\u2019t know you were supposed to. Didn\u2019t think you needed a guide. And maybe you were right.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m having a hard time paying attention to what you\u2019re saying. Can you say it all later?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. How\u2019s that. Is it too tight?\u201d\n\u201cNo, chaffing\u2019s alright, bleeding to death ain\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s get you into the car.\u201d\n\u201cOpen me up some of them pain killers first. Get me out four, no five of \u2019em.\u201d\nShe put five of the pills into his hand and then helped lift him up and place him in the passenger seat. She reclined it for him and then got into the driver\u2019s seat.\nIt took a little doing, but she got the car turned around and headed back for Vaughn.\n\u201cWe might as well keep going for Santa Rosa,\u201d Tennessee said. \u201cAin\u2019t nothing in Vaughn.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, well you just keep talking to me.\u201d\nTennessee nodded.\n\u201cI said keep talking.\u201d\n\u201cOh, right.\u201d\n\u201cWell?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking.\u201d Tennessee was quiet for a moment. \u201cSo, why don\u2019t you tell me who the hell those men were?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know \u2019em. I just know who they work for.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who do they work for?\u201d\n\u201cSomeone named Mr. Horrorshow.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Horrorshow?\u201d\n\u201cBut he works for Mr. Anxiety, and even Mr. Anxiety is just middle management.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Horrorshow and Mr. Anxiety? You got to be joking me, kid.\u201d\n\u201cThey have other names. But that\u2019s what they go by these days.\u201d\n\u201cYou run drugs for them? Owe \u2019em money? Date one of \u2019em?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no and no.\u201d\n\u201cWhy they after you then?\u201d\nThe girl was quiet.\n\u201cI think they think that I can be of service to them.\u201d\nTennessee wanted to laugh. He felt a bit delirious and figured the pain killers must\u2019ve been kicking in.\nThe girl grabbed one of his hands.\n\u201cWhen I squeeze, you squeeze back, OK?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever you say, ma\u2019am.\u201d\nEverything was quiet for a long while, but the girl pressed on his hand every minute or so and he pressed back.\n\u201cYou know, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really your fault,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cYou were talking about not being able to do your job no more. Well, I think maybe it ain\u2019t your fault.\u201d Tennessee paused. \u201cI mean, nowadays I think most people, especially young people, are so far from the path they were meant to be on, that I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s even possible for anyone to offer \u2019em any guidance or get \u2019em back on track.\u201d\nThe girl squeezed his hand hard and he squeezed back.\nThey arrived in Santa Rosa an hour later, and the girl didn\u2019t seem to have any trouble finding the hospital. She parked outside the emergency room.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell \u2019em anything about what happened,\u201d Tennessee instructed; she nodded and went inside.\nA few seconds later some orderlies came out with a stretcher and placed Tennessee on it.\n\u201cWhere\u2019d the girl go?\u201d\n\u201cWhat girl?\u201d\n\u201cThe one who drove me here and told you I was outside bleeding to death.\u201d\n\u201cIf she ain\u2019t still in the waiting room then I don\u2019t know, sir.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t see some thin Indian looking girl when you came out?\u201d\n\u201cShe your wife?\u201d\n\u201cNo, she wasn\u2019t any relation, but she should be here.\u201d\n\u201cWe can page her after we get you to surgery.\u201d\nThe doctor on duty this night asked Tennessee some questions about how he managed to get so much gunshot in him.\n\u201cFreak hunting accident.\u201d\n\u201cHunting accident, at night?\u201d\n\u201cYep. Makes me think of an old joke. Well, it\u2019s more of a comment a friend of mine made once. He said he didn\u2019t know if hunting was meant to keep the deer population in check or the redneck population. Going by me you might think the latter.\u201d\nThe doctor forced a smile.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201d\nThe doctor got the head nurse on duty to call the sheriff\u2019s office, and the state highway patrol, to find out if there were any reported shootings or robberies in the area this evening.\nOne of the sheriff\u2019s deputies called back five minutes later and said that all was quiet in northwestern New Mexico.\nThe doctor took an hour removing buck shot and debris from Tennessee\u2019s wounds and stitching them back up.\n\u201cYou know, Mr. uh,\u201d The Doctor glanced down at Tennessee\u2019s ID. \u201cMr. McClain? I don\u2019t think this was a hunting accident,\u201d\n\u201cWell, you think what you want,\u201d Tennessee replied as he pulled his blood encrusted jeans back on. He didn\u2019t bother with his shirt.\nHe was surprised that he wasn\u2019t already surrounded by policemen. The bodies should have been discovered by now, and no doubt the sheriff would be calling hospitals around the state looking for any survivors.\n\u201cWe think you should stay over night for observation.\u201d\n\u201cIf you think I\u2019m gonna stay overnight here then you got another thing coming.\u201d\n\u201cWho shot you?\u201d\n\u201cIf I told you that then you\u2019d take their hunting license away and I don\u2019t want that.\u201d\nThe doctor sighed and shook his head.\nHe gave Tennessee some instructions on how to care for the wounds, things Tennessee already knew, and then handed him a prescription for pain killers that he already had.\n\u201cWell, thanks for everything, doc.\u201d\nTennessee went to the lobby hoping to see the girl, but she wasn\u2019t there and no one remembered seeing a girl of that description.\nTennessee exited the hospital walked to his car opened the trunk and got out another shirt. He drove to the nearest all-night service station that had a pay phone.\nHe stood at the phone for a few minutes thinking things over in his head, then popped in a quarter and dialed a number that he had memorized.\n\u201cYeah\u2019lo.\u201d\n\u201cHey, Tom.\u201d\n\u201cHey, where the fuck are you, man? You were supposed to be here five hours ago.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I ran into some trouble.\u201d\n\u201cSome trouble. What? Someone follow you?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I guess you could say that I ran into someone else\u2019s trouble.\u201d\n\u201cHow bad?\u201d\n\u201cGot some lead shot into my back side.\u201d\n\u201cAnd them?\u201d\n\u201cThey got a lot worse.\u201d\n\u201cAnyone trailing you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\u201cYou able to drive?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cHow far away are you?\u201d\n\u201cFour hours.\u201d\n\u201cWell, come on as soon as you can. You can hole up here, and we\u2019ll push this thing off a few weeks until you get healed some.\u201d\n\u201cNaw, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be taking part in this one.\u201d\n\u201cYou hurt that bad, huh? Well, we got another job coming up.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want that one neither.\u201d\n\u201cHow long you plan on taking off?\u201d\n\u201cA long while.\u201d Tennessee paused. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019d say I\u2019m taking just about the rest of my life off.\u201d\n\u201cThe rest of your life? What are you taking about, man?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about doing something else.\u201d\nThere was silence.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s caused this change of mind?\u201d\n\u201cI guess I just realized that I ain\u2019t got no stake in this business.\u201d\n\u201cNo stake? Well, what do you have a stake in?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t know for sure. It\u2019s what I aim to find out.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you call me when you change your mind.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t plan on changing my mind.\u201d\n\u201cWell, call me later on, and we\u2019ll talk more then.\u201d\n\u201cGoodbye, Tom. Sorry to let you down.\u201d\nTennessee hung up the phone and walked back to his car.\nHe looked south along the highway in front of the service station.\nHe got in his car and sat there behind the driver\u2019s wheel, and for the first time in a long time he didn\u2019t know where he was headed.\nThat night he had a dream about her.\nShe was running through a field of wild grains, and she looked happy and free. She was sleek and elegant. The sky was bright and sunny, but over behind her there were dark clouds gathering on the horizon.\nShe kept on running, and found her way into an old, run-down trailer park. It was full of people who looked like they were wearing animal masks.\nThey had seen the storm cloud and they were all afraid.\nHe ran after the girl, and followed her into a junk yard full of broken down cars. Inside the cars Tennessee could see dark threatening shapes.\nHe tried to reach for his gun, to protect her, but he couldn\u2019t find it.\nHe heard a shot and knew for sure that someone had shot the girl.\nHe turned to find her, and the dream ended.\nSteve Moore currently lives in Carrboro, NC with his wife and daughter.

The runaway replicants of Blade Runner might suggest one brutal fate, but Olga Zilberbourg's Fabulist debut \"In Our Hearts Risen\" imagines a beautiful alternative.","hostname":"fabulistmagazine.com","source":"https:\/\/fabulistmagazine.com\/in-our-hearts-risen\/","sitename":"The Fabulist Words & Art","text":"Like most androids of her generation, Annie-A was petite and sturdy-looking. She tried to make herself useful and cleaned off specks of dust from the couch in my office and fluffed the cushions. Her only complaint was tiredness: every week, Mondays, at seven p.m., she came in to tell me how tired she was.\nThe technicians could find nothing wrong with her build. Her hormone levels were normal, her core DNA encoded with the basic programming had shown no signs of deterioration, her neural pathways were robust and continued to develop at a normal rate.\nThey diagnosed her with a mild robotic depressive disorder and sent her to me.\nI usually started by asking about her week, but Annie-A found the question difficult to approach. She worried the cushions, then leaned back and closed her eyes: she needed a little time to rest, she said.\nIt took many weeks for me to realize how verbally gifted she was. One day I grew aggravated with her fidgeting and asked her to describe precisely what she was looking for on the couch.\n\u201cTo use a mixed metaphor, I know I should see a forest, but I find myself interested in each and every tree, especially when there are towels thrown in,\u201d Annie-A said, studying the couch.\n\u201cTowels?\u201d\n\u201cHanging from the branches.\u201d\n\u201cThese are very odd metaphors for an android,\u201d I remarked. \u201cHave you ever seen a forest, Annie-A?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, glancing at me. \u201cIn a picture.\u201d\n\u201cIs a forest something that interests you?\u201d\n\u201cNot really,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was just a turn of the phrase.\u201d\nIt took me several more weeks to realize that her inventive use of metaphorical language hadn\u2019t been a singular occurrence. It was as if Annie-A\u2019s automatic activity log had become her primary concern. As she went about her day helping to make breakfast and feed the disabled child in her care, accompanying her to school and recording her notes, querying her music choices, guiding her through homework and physical training, feeding her lunch, assisting in the bathroom, feeding her dinner\u2014or simply being present while the girl\u2019s mother read to her\u2014Annie-A was trying to add to her log something new, something she hadn\u2019t thought of or noticed before, something that wasn\u2019t already contained in her records.\n\u201cBut why?\u201d I tried to imagine the sheer amount of energy she was expending on her log, the amount increasing each day. No wonder the poor thing was always exhausted. \u201cWhen did you decide that every entry had to be unique?\u201d\nAnnie-A shrugged and looked at me. I\u2019d always felt that blue was an unfortunate eye color for androids, especially if that was to be the only uniform feature among all the models. The designers had meant to help androids to be endearing and likeable and to fit in better with the human population, but I thought the shade they chose made them look distant and air-headed, if not callous.\n\u201cBut isn\u2019t every moment in life unique?\u201d Annie-A asked. She still hadn\u2019t realized that what she was doing with the log was unusual, that it hadn\u2019t been a part of her DNA programming but a result of some kind of growth defect.\nI had no choice but to report her.

I had my doctor\u2019s assurance that my Humang metabolism would not suffer, based on the data that NGASA\u2019s medical team generously provided.\nIn the name of intergalactic concord, I\u2019m delighted to quell some of the sillier rumors about the restaurant:\n1. Strangers\u2019 \u2014 sadly for my cannibal readers \u2014 does not serve people, cooked or tartare.\n2. Your plate isn\u2019t filled with indigestibles; your gut bacteria won\u2019t notice a thing.\n3. The waitstaff are from our own species, as the owners are committed to providing Humang jobs.\nStill, Strangers\u2019 is strange. Its philosophy is genuinely alien, and I don\u2019t mean just its culinary philosophy; I mean physics.\nAs we all know, physics is subjective. Matter\u2019s behavior follows our favorite customs. Does any childhood pass without its anti-gravity jaunts? Is any romance complete without its quantum entanglements?\nAcross the Humang world, physics consists of popular customs enshrined in treaties governing time, mass, charge, spin, and other internationally-held values.\nBut in the kitchen \u2014 thankfully! \u2014 physics is personal. Chef David Ruelle, for instance, prevents water from expanding as it freezes, creating the perfect concentration of flavor in sorbet. No other chef does this. No two chefs\u2019 physics are alike. Cuisine is a bridge between the freedom of physics, and the rigid laws of aesthetics.\nFor, as we also know, there is only one true sorbet. Anything else is in bad taste, and sorbet in bad taste is not-sorbet. We all believe this. Who dares to wear clothes in bad taste, not-clothes \u2014 an act infinitely madder than going naked? Admire a woman, by all means, but if her proportions are incorrect, she is not-beautiful.\nUnlike physics, taste is not subjective. Taste is reality. The laws of aesthetics decide what is and is not. Every chef recalls the glorious moment in culinary school when his superiors tasted, then delivered judgment: This is crepes Suzette. This is Pekingg duck. As I often have to remind disgruntled readers who call me a snob, cuisine is the essence of aesthetic law. Cuisine, my friends, is the taste of taste. And taste is what makes us Humang.\nExcept, it seems, at Strangers\u2019.\nThe spare, beige d\u00e9cor recalls the NGASA cafeteria where Strangers\u2019 originated, but with an upscale ambience promising adventure in comfort. The waitstaff are all young, with a certain cultish cheerfulness that might have warned me. I was given a properly well-lit table (they\u2019d done their homework) and the kitchen sent out my meal.\nStrangers\u2019 offers an unpretentious menu of classic Frengch and contemporary fusion dishes. The owners have wisely chosen not to serve their native cookery, which, of course, would be not-food. The wine list was adequate and the dinner crowd rather lubricated, but it was a gala opening.\nIf despite what I will now recount, you\u2019re still game to try Strangers\u2019, I can report that the consomm\u00e9 is consomm\u00e9, as classically rich and clear as I\u2019ve tasted. Likewise the romaine hearts and the asparagus mousseline, both true to form: pure but not bland, juicily crisp and silken respectively.\nPas mal, I was thinking, when the waiter offered me a choice of entr\u00e9es.\n\u201cWould you like the brook trout with white sauce, or the quail with raisins and \u2018brown\u2019 sauce?\u201d\nLike you, reader, I was confused. \u201cBrown,\u201d I later found, is the spelling used on the menu for the brief vowel howl issuing from his lips. And no, white sauce is not a misprint for wet sauce, which would have been just as redundant. Naturally sauce is white. Everything is white. Our world is white. That is an aesthetic axiom.\nIrritated at having to correct him, I said:\n\u201cYou mean sauce meuniere and sauce espagnole. You should call the mother sauces by their proper names.\u201d\nApologizing cheerfully, the waiter explained that the staff liked to describe food by its \u201ccolor.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is \u2018color\u2019?\u201d I asked.\nI don\u2019t do well with restaurants that promote gimmicks. The last time I was thrown by menu vocabulary, the phrase in question was \u2018molecular kombucha,\u2019 and the joint closed shortly after my review.\nMy waiter delivered a mini-lecture, hands clasped at heart-level, as if he couldn\u2019t decide whether to bow or beat his breast. \u201cColor,\u201d he explained, is an alien concept. There are many \u201ccolors.\u201d Each has a name, which my waiter uttered in squeaks and howls: \u201cgreen\u201d beans, \u201cblue\u201d berries. The \u201ccolor\u201d of an object, he said, \u201ccorresponds to the length in angstroms of the light waves that it reflects,\u201d and so on.\nAngstroms! Please. I considered teleporting through the wall into the street, which \u2014 though against the rules of public physics \u2014 is the best way to rebuke a restaurant that bores.\nBut as my waiter lectured, I\u2019d downed a lot of chardonnay. Any cop who saw my breach of public physics would also smell my breath.\nIf you\u2019re among those angry readers who write to this magazine, labelling me a \u201csilver spoon-brandishing snob,\u201d a \u201cpompous, prejudiced, arrogant asshole,\u201d or (my favorite) a \u201cheartless, soulless, masticating bully with the tastebuds of a fossilized reptile\u201d merely because I was honest about your beloved but worthless local diner \u2014 ah! Would that you had seen my forbearance at Strangers\u2019.\nPatiently, I reminded myself that young people are prone to faddish notions. On every college campus are a few poetic souls insisting that down is up, right is left, and the laws of aesthetics are as subjective as physics. As if taste were up for grabs, like atomic weight!\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d I said tactfully, patiently, to my waiter. \u201cBut espagnole sauce is not \u2018brown.\u2019 It is white, like meuniere sauce, and everything else. Our world is white. That is axiomatic. I\u2019ll have the trout.\u201d\nMy words should have concluded this eccentric episode. They did not.\n\u201cSir,\u201d asked the waiter, delivering my trout, \u201chow would you describe the difference between the stripes in a rainbow?\u201d\nI chewed lengthily while he hovered. Truite a la meuniere at Strangers\u2019 is truite a la meuniere. Sophomoric theorizing by the waitstaff adds an unwelcome garnish.\n\u201cRainbows,\u201d I replied, \u201care white. Their stripes are different shades of white. Like everything else, because our world is white. That is axiomatic.\u201d\nAgain, the waiter clasped his hands over his heart. I asked for dessert \u2014 but not if it were a cheesecake or bread pudding. If Strangers\u2019 was offering a cheesecake or bread pudding (I said with emphasis) I would leave now.\nUncomfortable as the waiter had made me, I was almost disappointed to hear that Strangers\u2019 did not offer middlebrow desserts and a reason to leave. Savarin aux fruits at Strangers\u2019 is savarin aux fruits. Patissiers everywhere, take note! If life-forms from another galaxy can drench cake in a good quality Jamaican rum, so should Humangs. Pas mal du tout. Oh, to end my review with that good dessert.\nI regret having to mark down Strangers\u2019 for poor service. Putting myself in the owners\u2019 shoes (or whatever wraps their pseudopods) I understand the difficulty of training staff who don\u2019t live in the same atmosphere as their bosses. But it\u2019s my job to be honest. Dining out comprises more than what\u2019s on your plate. Service can make or spoil a meal. There is simply no excuse for \u2014 well, for a waiter to roll up his uniform sleeve and lay his bare forearm down beside your napkin. Displays of muscled forearm do not belong in fine restaurants. They belong in sushi bars.\nAs I stared in shock, my waiter said, \u201cSir, allow me to point out that your skin and mine are different? See that lady behind you?\u201d\nBehind me sat a Conggolese couple, speaking in Frengch. Tr\u00e9s chic, but the woman\u2019s figure was incorrect.\n\u201cThat lady,\u201d the waiter gestured, \u201cand I, are both of Africang descent. You might say that we\u2019re both not-white.\u201d\nI choked \u2014 as I hope, reader, you too are doing. No decent person calls another not-white. It would be tantamount to calling him invisible, because everything is white. Seeing my distress, the waiter straightened with one arm bare, one arm in uniform.\n\u201cI might call you \u2026 not-brown,\u201d he remarked. \u201cEnjoy dessert.\u201d\nHe went over to the Conggolese couple\u2019s table. The lady, in high spirits, ordered what sounded like beans in a glass: haricots aux verre. Arriving, this surreal dish proved to be \u201cgreen\u201d beans, haricots \u201cverts,\u201d which words the lady repeated.\nShe took to laughing in that madcap style that only grown women inflict upon Humangity. I confess, I was stunned to hear an alien \u201ccolor\u201d named by a speaker of Frengch. Frengch is the language of cuisine, of taste itself!\nClosing my eyes, I heard all around, like gently popping balloons, alien words spoken by Humangs, without the faintest regard for the shattering of aesthetic axioms. This was an unpleasant experience, more like an emergency room than a restaurant.\nThen I noticed a berry on my dessert plate. A \u201cblue\u201d berry, so-called. It looked white. So did the plate. So did the dessert fork, the table, and everything on it. That was normal. Yet, remembering that \u201ccolor\u201d meant the length of light waves reflected from an object, I thought \u2026 I don\u2019t know what I thought.\nWhat I did was to shorten the length of the light waves emanating from that berry. The berry began glowing. I summoned the waiter and asked him what \u201ccolor\u201d the berry was.\n\u201cViolet!\u201d said the waiter. \u201cCool.\u201d\nIn the berry\u2019s glow, I saw the Conggolese lady\u2019s eyes light up, her teeth shine, her form \u2014 which, as I said, was incorrect \u2014 look astonishingly lovely.\nI have since thought that the alien heterodoxy of \u201ccolor\u201d might have advantages for aesthetic presentation \u2026 if only because the vision of beauty and incorrectness sitting down, as it were, at the same refectory table, invites in a way that I \u2014 in curiosity, awe, fear, which? \u2014 in short, that I tremble to accept.\nEh bien mes amis. Because Strangers\u2019 is unique, and in deference to NGASA\u2019s record of getting unique things off the ground (so to speak), I award Strangers\u2019 four stars for good food.\nI withhold one star due to eccentric service. And philosophical crisis. For which I am, nevertheless \u2014 not-ungrateful.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

The night was pretty average: We went to the wine bar, finished a couple bottles, and then departed with promises to do the same thing again in a couple weeks.\nThe driver, Paul, had just moved to town and was driving to learn the city. We chatted about the quality of the wine bar, the area, and where to find good pork buns. Whenever I\u2019ve had a few glasses of wine, I instantly turn into the mayor of the situation: giving helpful tips on restaurants, parks, and events to check out. It was an easy way to pass the time for a few minutes, and it felt rude not to engage the drivers as real people. We were all using an impersonal app, but we didn\u2019t have to be strangers.\nWhen we pulled up, I was in the middle of trying to find my keys while still wine-swirled. Wishing Paul a good evening and hoping he would check out the pork bun place I recommended, I tried to pack back up while also exiting the car. I stood on the curb as he drove away, double checking that all the zippers were sealed on my bag before going upstairs.\nI glanced down then, and saw it \u2014 the Polaroid \u2014 laying in the street. It was right where the car had just been, and I knew it had fallen out with me.\nThe picture was face up. It had missed being run over by the departing car, and was looking vulnerable on the blacktop. I picked it up; there were no markings to indicate what year it was from.\nIt showed a pretty woman, in a black sundress, with large, round, gold sunglasses. She was against some foliage too grainy to identify. She was vibrant and half laughing or saying something, her hands gesturing in a way that made me think she was probably talking to someone off-camera. Her hair was up in a clip or bun, but I could tell it was quite long, and would be lovely if she\u2019d only let it down.\nI carried the precious snapshot as I let myself into my building and walked up to my third-floor apartment. I had the idea that I would immediately find Paul the driver and return his, or a recent passenger\u2019s, beloved treasure.\nHowever, my good deed was thwarted, either because the app didn\u2019t want to connect me, or because my wine-fuddled brain was struggling. I put the Polaroid on the coffee table and vowed to try again the next day.\nIn the bright of the morning it was still there, not a figment of the orange-twilight street light. I re-inspected it, but found no more details. The laughing, captivating woman wasn\u2019t looking into the camera \u2014 it was a candid moment.\nReally, who loses a Polaroid? Did they still even make Polaroid cameras? I remembered distantly that they may have been discontinued and then revived. I had no messages from Uber, nothing that indicated Paul had noticed anything missing. In the app, there were options for saying something was lost, but I couldn\u2019t tag something as found. I could report the driver as inappropriate, but I couldn\u2019t say he was refreshingly delightful and needed his property. There were links and buttons, but nowhere to write a message to a real human.\nIn the end, I logged a lost item report, and tried to describe in 200 words or less that I\u2019d found a photograph that wasn\u2019t mine. I placed the Polaroid on my high shelf where it couldn\u2019t go astray.\nOn Monday at work we chatted over our uneventful weekends filled with TV, chores, and trying out something new, but not too new.\nAnd when it came to my turn, I blurted out, \u201cLane and I went to that new brewery, the Guilde, on Sunday. They had a waffle pop-up and a live band, it was good.\u201d\nAnd there she was in my memory: Lane, the woman in the photograph.\nShe liked German beers and waffles with bananas, but asked them to skip the Nutella. She\u2019d worn a black top with a geometric pattern, and dark skinny jeans. Her hair was up in a ponytail so it didn\u2019t get in the way while she ate. Her shoes had stars on them and she wore them when she wanted to have fun. We had been dating for two weeks, and I think I knew I already loved her.\nMy coworkers remarked on the new gal in my life. How had I never mentioned her? I deflected and explained that we\u2019d only been dating a couple weeks, but surely they\u2019d noticed her in my Instagram? I just figured it was silly to announce a new partner when you could clearly see her in my social media feed.\nThe lie was taken as truth and we moved onto talking about work and work distractions. It\u2019s so easy to miss things on social media. There\u2019s so much of it.\nDuring the 3 p.m. slow hour at work, I opened up Instagram to look at the fascinating lives of other people. I had a few likes, no comments. Remarkably, my account had brewery pictures \u2026 except I hadn\u2019t actually gone to the brewery. The whole event had been a lie.\nBut there it was, pictures of the beers we\u2019d tried, the band (appropriately tagged), and an order of waffles with bananas and no Nutella. Lane wasn\u2019t photographed, but she was there.\nI quickly scanned through my past pictures, and there were other additions. No pictures directly of Lane, but pictures of our life together. The previous weekend, we\u2019d apparently gone to a retro duckpin-bowling alley. She\u2019d tried a porter we both agreed tasted like \u201cthe worst cookie you\u2019ve ever eaten.\u201d (My coworker Kortney thanked us for the heads up and would avoid that beer.) Our score sheet had silly nicknames: She had called herself \u201cLanitude\u201d and I was \u201cDarkwing DDD.\u201d Lane beat me with a score of 170 to 120 \u2014 neither of us was very good at duckpin bowling, apparently.\nWe\u2019d also had a low-key pasta and Netflix night. Cooked up with some fresh tomatoes and shrimp. There were pictures of the pasta and wine, a silly picture of my cat begging for food, and a heaping pile of dirty dishes to be done the next day. I had posted that we watched \u201cThe Magicians\u201d \u2014 a show I\u2019d already finished. But I wanted to rewatch it with Lane, because I knew she\u2019d love it too.\nLooking at the pictures, I could remember the feeling of her hair as we snuggled on the couch. It was indeed long when she let it down, and she loved when I ran my fingers through it.\nI could even find the hints of our first date. We\u2019d gone to an outdoor concert. Scrolling through the pictures of beers and bands, I could remember it had been awkward at first. It was so worrisome, figuring out if we would insult the other with our choices, but quickly we were sharing our favorite foods and it was brilliant. We finished the date by buying a cookie as big as a dinner plate and eating the whole thing in a slightly drunken glow.\nAnd the pictures kept coming. Every few days, a small new moment to treasure. We went to an exhibit of historic advertising illustrations, and became fascinated with the depictions of people who seemed to have totally mysterious customs and formalities. How did everyone seem to know that lawns were cut into vertical stripes and not horizontal stripes? Did women really once serve every meal out of cans? Surely nobody ever had so many rules about the number of jello desserts needed at a cookout? The women in the ads always looked so lonely, trapped in their perfect product-placement worlds.\nYou would think it would be hard to hide Lane from my friends and family. But that\u2019s what makes social media so perfect. It was so easy to say her job prevented her from being on social media. The same job that prevented her from making plans. We could do things together on the spur of the moment, and it was just too hard to sync up with others.\nPeople tend to fill in whatever details they want: she\u2019s got a job in the government, is a high-paid executive, travels for work, or she\u2019s just a private person.\nNobody asked, but they enjoyed that we seemed to enjoy each other. Lane obviously took so much joy from shooting goofy pictures of me and I looked so happy. It was she who held the camera, she documented our adventures, but no one asked to see her or needed to tag her.\nIt became even easier when the pandemic hit. We all worked from home, and the less I and my coworkers saw of each other\u2019s actual interiors, the better.\nLane and I upgraded to a larger apartment, so we\u2019d each have space to work. We didn\u2019t want work to consume our lives, but needed our own desk and space. I hired movers, but made sure to handle the Polaroid personally. It never left my sight, and I always carefully held my precious plastic square. I couldn\u2019t put it in my pocket, it might crumple and damage the image.\nAgain, it was all very easy. They were hired to wear masks, not get too close, and just move my stuff. No one asked for my help or wondered why I sat clutching a small photograph.\nThe Polaroid never changed. She was always Lane on a sunny day amongst the green, happily chatting with someone we couldn\u2019t see. I would like to pretend it was me, but I knew it wasn\u2019t. She was always so great to everyone she met, and the photograph showed her being her natural and wonderful self. She was everybody\u2019s friend and made sure no one felt lonely around her.\nIn the new apartment, the Polaroid went in my office, on another high shelf away from the cat. And I closed the door when I finished work so she was extra safe. I thought about buying an actual safe \u2014 but she wouldn\u2019t like that. First thing every morning, I checked on her picture in case something might have happened. If I lost the photograph, I wasn\u2019t sure what would happen. She might disappear. Or, worse, I would see our breakup play out in my feed. Vague-posts about our fights, her moving out, dividing up our stuff, my solitary pity dinners, and the lonely too-big apartment we\u2019d chosen together.\nShe had to be safe. She was my everything. Although my life had gotten more simple, in my feed it seemed to remain full, and she was always a presence.\nWe found a large historic cemetery only a couple miles away and had secret picnics amongst the tombstones.\nWe got a mix of silly and serious masks to wear for errands and going out. Nobody recognized me with the mask, and in my photos I was a stranger to myself.\nWe tried bread making, but the starter just grew black mold. It looked like an opulent alien forest in the photos, but we agreed to end our baking experiments.\nMy cat, old but not really that old, passed away. Lane made us go through a ridiculously elaborate funeral for it, and I love that she went above and beyond for my cat. It really helped.\nEven though the pandemic had caused a pet shortage, we managed to get a dog. A black mutt we named Than, though neither of us can remember who came up with that name or why.\nThe dog, like her, was only online. Which was very convenient since it meant I never had to go out in the cold to walk the dog. But I would have, because he made her so happy. We both loved the dog and took way too many photos of him. For Christmas we dressed him up in a sweater vest and a big bow. We ate picanha we made with the new sous vide she bought me. The last photo of that day was a very adorable selfie of our candlelit dinner while the dog begged at our feet.\nDuring the pandemic my branch office closed. Luckily, we all kept our jobs, but there\u2019s been talk of going back into work \u201csomeday\u201d and maybe having to relocate closer to the main office.\nBut I like working from home, making my employer lots of money, and having a good rapport with my coworkers in our chat channels.\nLiving with Lane is easy. Having real-world time with coworkers just introduces difficult logistics. I\u2019ll petition to remain remote, or even find a new job if I need to. I don\u2019t want to risk moving again. Risk losing Lane into a box, under a radiator, or have her falling out of a moving van.\nShe\u2019s safe on my shelf. Safe with me.\nLane has really given me the best life. I don\u2019t need to worry about what I\u2019ll be doing for the weekend. She\u2019ll be there. We\u2019ll eat waffles with bananas, watch a new movie, and laugh over how the protagonist makes the dumbest decisions. We\u2019ll eat at the best new restaurants, the ones no one knows about and that haven\u2019t gotten too trendy yet. She\u2019ll take pictures of my ridiculous bedhead, and then we\u2019ll snuggle in a patch of sun while I\u2019m tangled in her long hair.\nI don\u2019t know who would lose Lane\u2019s Polaroid in an Uber, but it doesn\u2019t matter. I now know the rapture of a captured heart. I found a love that never fades, chips, or cracks. Lane was lost, fragile, alone, and I found her.\nI\u2019m her protector now, while we\u2019re together. One day I\u2019ll die, and I know she\u2019ll find her next love. My beloved will carry on in a billion deathless, digital reflections.\nAnd everyone will know how amazing we were together. She\u2019ll make sure there are photos of everything.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Not with the flesh kind, either. But we made good money coming up with patents like that.)\nHe wanted everything fast, which was another reason the passion ran out early. That man, in bed! Imagine bedding Leonardo, humping the future like that. Usually he\u2019d roll over and conk right out. Sometimes he\u2019d say \u201cEvolution invented the orgasm\u201d as explanation, which I suppose meant that mine didn\u2019t matter, what with science not knowing what it was for.\nNot for creation, certainly. Not now. Not anymore.\nThere was the one thing, the one glitch: human error. It just couldn\u2019t be engineered away. Do not put a microwave in the break room, he\u2019d tell them again and again. Under no circumstances should you put a single microwave in any break room!\nThe reason they\u2019d always go ahead and do it anyway made sense, because until you can replace all your humans, you want them powering up as quick as they can, and they still ran on food \u2014 Cargill, the agro giant, was a customer after all.\nBut that was the old way of thinking, before our patents changed the world.\nI remember one night when he was working on Icarus, cradling that precious little head in his arms. He said to me, \u201cCait, the past is full of losers.\u201d\nWe had been half-men, half-beasts, built by chance and stumbling around. But here was the child of the man of the future! A child who would never put a microwave in a break room.\nBut General Electric and Samsung, they couldn\u2019t see what my husband had seen \u2014 so off he\u2019d go into the night with his vacuum and his tools, off to clean his creations out of the carpets.\nI told him \u2014 I begged him \u2014 not to go into those break rooms.\n\u201cJesus, Tom, they can get a janitor to do basic retrieval!\u201d\nBut he just couldn\u2019t trust his creations to losers. He was a workaholic, that man, and his heart strained beneath his pride.\nSo here are tonight, just the girls and me and our precious fixed-up Icarus, whispering our prayers in the ICU.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Rootedness a thing of the past. His Ukrainian-born grandfather, a farmer and miner, who tilled and tunneled in PA. It was selling the farm that did him in. A year into retirement, with nothing to do, he died.\nAn internal clock jump starts early Saturdays, and he is in the kitchen stirring oatmeal for everyone. P welcomes the homemade, slow made steel cut oats, not the instant kind with no bite. The dog loves her little bowl of oatmeal with milk, has loved milk since puppyhood. He loves doing for them, the girls. During the first hours of the morning, with his cereal and coffee, he reads. Books on plants, trees, animals. Chapters on pruning, mulching, feeding; on footprints, browsing, scat. The footprints, scat and browsed branches on the property inform him: he knows who was here, he knows who visited while he was away.\nAfter breakfast, they have what they call their walkabout, when they visit the trees and shrubs, noting their shape, their development, were the leaves coming in, did they look healthy, need mulch, water, nutrients. They begin with the oaks on the property line, their best trees, they agree, growing fast, straight, tall, untroubled. Within a few years, they went from saplings to trees, with thickened trunks. Within five years, they provided shade. Ten years in, they are beyond his reach, too tall to spray even if needed. He\u2019d put in two at first, along the property line, because in maturity, they were tallest, taller even than the maples. Seeing how well they settled in, and how fast, he ordered two more saplings, younger than the first ones that went in. They too settled in to a good life. In the fall, their small acorns provide the local population of chips and squirrels with winter forage. These are red oaks, relatives of the sacred ones at Moreh, at Hebron, at Beth El, at Jabal Ausha, Ain Yajus, Suf, the biblical terebinths most worshipped and most denounced. Idolatry, the prophets called it. Upon every high hill and under every green tree, they warned. Still Abraham built an altar under a sacred terebinth at Hebron and dwelt there. Jacob buried his wives\u2019 foreign Gods under it, and Joshua sacrificed there. Pilgrims still visit the descendants of these terebinths and tie rags off their backs to the branches, to attach themselves, become one with it.\nTo become at one with a tree, with nature, to transcend the self. Tree worship might be his religion if he were religiously inclined. Something to do with their magnificence, their silence, their rootedness. A still equanimity in the face of intemperance. Bare dark bark in hard cold winters, soft young greens when the ground yields, deep green in heat, followed by brittle colorful falls. When bled, they bled silently. When felled, they dropped heavily. It was the 200-year maple that sold him on the house, and as soon as he owned the house, he worried about the tree. If it came down it would crush the house or car or barn. But worrying didn\u2019t discourage him from putting in more trees and shrubs so that now on its way down the maple might also take out the birches out front, or the kwanzan on the north side, or the lilac and viburnum, depending which way it went. It was probably as old as the house, someone said. He wondered about this. Would a tenant farmer and his wife, Sarah and Thomas McMahon, b. 17xx, d. 18xx and 17xx, according to the gravestones across the road, would they have planted this tree or trees this close to the house? Of course people plant trees too close all the time. They\u2019re small when they go in, and they can\u2019t or don\u2019t fully imagine them at full grown girth and height. He\u2019s done it too, even knowing it\u2019s what he shouldn\u2019t do, the stand of pines for example, six when four would have been enough, the bed of viburnum, which required thinning. This maple, two maples grown together, was likely a natural planting, two airborne seed pods landed in the same place, in an area not mowed, and grew undisturbed. Which means there were maples on the property before this maple, ancestors. This ancient\u2019s descendants are all along the stone wall on the south side of the house. They moved one of them, a slender leggy thing shaded by the mature parent above it. Alone, an individual in full sun, it settled in quickly, branched out fully, a healthy specimen. Though he\u2019d made a point of planting it far enough from the barn to give it space, it too will grow too close at some point. But it was likely to survive the barn, considering their ages, the old structure coming apart, the tree young and rooting.\nThe farmer who hayed the fields behind them recalled a magnificent old pine that came down one winter, in a heavy snowstorm. This inspired the stand of white pines above the wall, on the south side of the property when of course they should have been on the north, as a windscreen. Even informed decisions are often wrong. He\u2019d wondered why there were no pines in the immediate area, while ten miles north, at the Falls, the oldest pines in the Northeast flourished. He\u2019d purchased three pines at a time, a tight fit in the bed of the old pickup. They were heavy even at five foot tall. Three men wrestled them off the truck and into the ground. He\u2019d watered them through their first season. Wrapped the trunks in the fall. Mulched. They are now over twenty feet tall, shading trees he didn\u2019t want shaded, one of the favored oaks, also the locust. Cutting down two of the pines was probably the right thing to do, but he\u2019d nurtured them a long time, helped them develop new leaders when a fungus took their first ones. In heavy snow, he goes up there with a broom or snow shovel, to shake the branches free, the branches within reach anyway, before the snow hardens. He knows now why there are no pines in the valleys: In higher elevations, gale winds do the work of freeing branches.\nYes, he\u2019s become a branch freer, tree keeper, care taker. On weekends. During the week he works to pay for the trees, weekends he nurtures them, also work. He has reforested a cornfield, put in hundreds of trees and shrubs. Ten years ago, newly planted, the field appeared as a young Eden, with saplings and all things slender, all needing his attention. He\u2019d attended them: watered, fed, fenced. When the temperatures dropped, he wrapped the tender trunks in burlap; when it warmed up, he loosened the wraps, to let air in, then, when frost was no longer an issue, removed the wraps, folded and stored them for the following winter.\nNow the pines, oaks, and willow are beyond his reach, fending for themselves, mostly. Now he is largely unneeded. He attends anyway, watches, listens, studies, worries. A year into ownership, that is if a 200-year old maple can be owned, he hired a tree climber with some experience in tree service. The kid climbed into the tree, cut out the deadwood, and cabled the trunks, a triangular arrangement for added strength. They considered a lightning rod, read the pros and cons, and decided against it. Two hundred years without one was a powerful argument. Also it grew in a valley, surrounded by higher elevations. If lightning struck, it was likely to strike up there.\nThen lightning struck. It was possible that lightning had struck before, with no one around to see and hear it. This time, the girls were there, they saw and heard; the damage was further evidence. The biblical bolt came through the branches on the southwest side of the tree, slammed into the ground, a loud thick thud. Flames flamed upward, churned up the soil, blackened the bed of pachysandra, then collapsed inward.\nThis happened late summer, hurricane season down south, but the storms were making their way up here, way north, unnaturally. Nature fighting back, one nature writer wrote. Perhaps. It could also be a cyclical thing, El Nino winds and all that. Or both. He remembers boyhood winters in Pennsylvania with massive amounts of snow, followed by years of milder weather. Recent summers have been hot and wet, winters long and harsh, the intemperance North America is known for.\nNow he watches the tree, the crown, where early signs of trouble are said to appear. Is it spare? The leaves on the bulk of the tree seem more or less intact, but this doesn\u2019t mean the tree will live. The death of something huge and ancient would be slow, he thinks, a behemoth dying, long lived, but not immortal. Orwell\u2019s elephant drawing long difficult breaths for a long drawn out time. For now the tree stands rooted, silent, thick and dark, impervious. The unworried equanimity of a God. But Gods, we now know, die too. Which makes Godliness merely an art, the art of the quiet mind, the freedom of fearlessness, of Wu-Wei. Silent and strong in the face of knockabout life.\nHe watches. Listens. Hears only his own heartbeat, his own anxiety. The tree is silent, even as he stands beside it, pruning saw in hand. Fearlessness is its answer, its message. It is fearless and rooted. It doesn\u2019t come and go, as he does. Doesn\u2019t seek experience, eventful life, plot. It stays put. Change comes anyway, in three month intervals, with seasonal rebirth and death as the main events, recursive little lives within the one life, a nested structure. The drama is in the repeat: spring summer fall winter, spring summer fall winter, spring summer \u2014 with the added event of the occasional turbulence, the female hurricanes, Katrina, Sandy, Patricia, the male ice storms, Victor, Frank, Fred.\nIts leaves come down in the fall, as always. If smaller and fewer than usual, they are not notably smaller and fewer. Is it showing signs of age, fatigue? He listens hard. What is it saying, if anything? In the meantime, one of the birches needs attending. Two trunks in the clump did not grow in, the third is sparse. He starts with the dead trunks, cuts the outermost branches first, works his way inward. The sound of his chain saw informs him the wood is already spalted, has been dead awhile. It has the bite marks of the birch bore, but it would have survived the bore if the sapsuckers had left it alone. They sucked it dry. And this isn\u2019t the only birch they killed. With the two trunks down, the third looks sad, unlikely to flourish, so he cuts it down too. By the time he hauls all the wood away, the day is half gone. The stump will have to wait for another day, another weekend. He moves on to something else, there is always something else. The bed of blackened pachysandra quickly filled with weeds, broad-leaved and deep rooted. The weed seeds probably shipped in with the mulch, unseasoned, advertised promises notwithstanding. Or the birds he\u2019d fed all winter dropped this particular seed. But it is the absence of the pachysandra that allowed the weeds to flourish. Spring, he will purchase and plant five flats. In the meantime, regular weeding. Some pull up easy, others break off and have to be extracted with a trowel. It is slow hot work. He tries staying on the shady side, and still he is sweating. He pulls off his wet shirt and hooks it onto a low branch. When his back protests bending over, he works on his knees; when his knees say no, he goes inside for a glass of water. He\u2019s cleared maybe half the bed, the rest will have to wait. It might be easier after rain, with the ground softened. An overnight shower is expected. He will run errands during these warmest late summer hours, then mow when the sun is low. He rinses off, feels better. In the car, he runs the air conditioning and gives himself to this part of his weekend life: the grocery shopping, the hardware store, the bakery, walking every aisle so as not to forget things. There are rewards for taking your time, coming across new products he might have missed, the better tonic, the local capricola without nitrates.\nFor dinner, a free-range little chicken which he will roast brown on the grill. For flavoring fresh sage leaves from the garden under the skin. In the cavity, fresh thyme and a lemon. The sides, also from the garden: a julienne of leeks, saut\u00e9ed spinach with garlic. With the groceries in the car, he drives home slowly, a weekender enjoying the pristine country estates immaculately maintained by hired hands. He too is looking to hire someone to do the leaves this year, in November, when they are knee deep.\nThey cook dinner together, the prep work part of the ritual, as important as the end result. They take their time with the sides, eat the salad while they cook, sip wine. The dog participates too, watching every move, hoping for scraps, a sliver of bacon, the chicken liver. They are a family of three on weekends. After dinner a fire in the fireplace and a book. The dog alternates between them, stretched long beside one for a while, then curled up beside the other. The heat of the fire spreads warmth through his lower back, her hips, his knees, his stiff neck, the long dog\u2019s spine. His body sinks deep and warm into the rug, a sheepskin. The sheep, he thinks gratefully. The fire is going strong now, burning through the logs he piled up, one from the old apple tree that came down one winter, two from the birch on steroids, which grew faster and died sooner. Trees, he thinks gratefully. Always giving. Clean air, shade, beauty, warmth. Rootedness, rest, repose their message. For now, on the rug, beside the fire, he too feels rooted, at rest, in repose, a tree. He is inside the trunk, in the pale supple interior, past the phloem, in the inner cambium. He is inside, he is tall, silent, rooted, his lower core attached, solid, balanced, his upper half stretched up, toward the sky, reaching high. In this deep stability, deep and tall, his heart is quiet, his mind clear and still. This is what he wants, needs: this stability, this deep balance, this rootedness, this quiet. The surprise, what he didn\u2019t know, what he now feels, is this: the ground isn\u2019t still, it moves, heaves, quakes. And the tree, rooted as it is, heavy as it is, moves with it, silently, minimally. He moves with it. Together they move. All the trees are moving. The pines step north, where they should be, the maples south. The birches position themselves beside the maples, in their understory, the kwanzan moves to the south side of the house, the locust inches up toward the oak. The willow moves across the road, into the wetland, the redbud drops into deeper shade. The crabs rearrange themselves. It\u2019s this ability to shift weight, to move, that keeps them standing, he understands. It\u2019s this flux that makes for eternal being. He feels the movement, the shift. He too must move to survive.\nSunday night, he is back on his sleeper sofa, in his quiet apartment, temperature controlled. No breeze will blow his neck stiff because she is too warm. The windows will be closed to keep out noise, dirt, cold. The covers will stay in place, ends tucked in. They are opposites this way: he likes to be cool in day, warm at night. She likes to sleep cool, stay warm awake. He winds down with the end of a Turner classic, bits and pieces of a National Geographic extravaganza, the Antiques Roadshow. Nothing too engaging, nothing that will keep him anxiously awake, no world disasters, tragedies, complaints. He flips back and forth between channels, pleasing only himself. With the television still on, he checks his email, researches things online: a better trellis, more mousetraps, antifungals, non-toxic toxins. He will order more of that powder for tomato blight, the granules for slugs. He has to research the birch bore problem. Also the best way to discourage sapsuckers from demolishing the birches. Though pristine white in the winter landscape, these birches are the highest maintenance of the trees on the property. And short lived. If he were to do it again, he\u2019d go with the hardier brown river birches. It\u2019s already eleven. He has to make the nightly good night sleep tight call, verify the girls are safe, then sleep. Continuous undisrupted sleep, he hopes.\nWhen he\u2019s away, he knows, the girls take over. They sleep splayed on both sides of the bed, his and hers. P aligns the stretch of her spine along the midline, where the mattress remains unindented, supportive, belonging to no one. Come Friday, the end of his sweltering city week, she picks him up at the station, they eat a light dinner, and then he occupies his side, she hers, the middle is the middle again, between them, though now and then an arm or leg crosses over and jars the other awake. Neither he nor she sleep well. Hemmed in by him, she tosses, turns and disrupts his REMs. Or determined to stay quiet for him, she remains wakeful, quietly sleepless, but he feels her open staring eyes and they keep him from dropping off again. When he finally takes his pillow and the extra blanket to the couch, they both sleep better.\nIt wasn\u2019t always this way. They once slept better together, worse apart. Then came the weekend house, an escape from the city. At first they went back and forth together, driving up the dark Taconic Fridays, down the dark Taconic Sundays, then she wanted to stay in one place, no packing and unpacking, no more up down up down. She wanted the pleasure of stepping outdoors without the bother of shoes, keys, phone, bag. She could walk the dog in the fields off-leash. Better yet, the dog could walk herself while she worked on the porch. So the girls stayed summer months, stayed for the feel of fall, then for spring, soon they were living at the house full time, and he became a stranger in the bed, a man reasserting himself Fridays, Saturdays, holidays, vacations, making her retreat to her side of the bed, the dog to the foot.\nHe took getting used to on Friday night, knowing better on Saturday, missing, maybe, on Sunday. By Monday they were back to their usual, the long dog horizontal on her absent master\u2019s pillow, P all over his and hers, on the diagonal, on the vertical, in the no-man\u2019s middle.\nThe things you most fear will take place, as if the fear itself brings them on, the power of the theurgical mind. It begins as a sort of shedding, comes on with a warning crack. They are upstairs, in bed, with the view of the tree from the windows straight ahead. Several slender branches from up high break off first. He sees the crown buckle and fall. The ground beneath quakes. The house shakes. He jumps out of bed, gets the girls up. Hurry, he says. This is the worst place to be. They go downstairs and watch. It\u2019s dawn, the day is just beginning, a light soft blue. It\u2019s quiet again, for now. The tree is silent, though beheaded. He steps outside. On the northeast side, the largest of the branches are spiked into the earth, leaving a two foot crater, but they fell away from the house, mercifully. He would have to call a tree service. Cutting this ancient down would be costly, and then the wood. He could try to sell some of it for lumber. And still there would be years of fires, years and years of warm fires.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

But Nick Fischer never told us to keep it down, and he sometimes helped settle arguments over rules, so he was good in our book.\nOur arrangement was as such: on Friday nights, he let us play Magic: The Gathering in the small room next to the aisle of \u201choly spirits.\u201d If we stayed that late, we would help him close up, and with Nick plus the five of us, it didn\u2019t take long.\nWe wondered what would happen if someone tried to rob the place, and the consensus was that Nick would be fucked, since we were out of shape and nearsighted and only one of us knew any jiu-jitsu.\nNick kept a steady business, despite all the blasphemy. The Blood was right off State Route 515, in a lawless no man\u2019s land wedged between dry counties, and he was open until 3 a.m. All kinds came to the Blood, and most kinds were welcome.\nThat one night we were busy playtesting Stephen\u2019s new deck. He figured out a way to gain 26 life by turn three, and we were giddy with success.\nWe heard the mechanical wheeze of the automatic door opening out front, but we didn\u2019t hear Nick greet anyone. Weird. He was usually pretty jolly with customers.\nHumidity flooded in the open door. We could hear the yell of the cicadas outside. For a second, the fluorescents blinked.\nWe heard a raspy voice: \u201cYou\u2019ve been careless, Nicholas Fischer.\u201d\nNow, it\u2019s not every day you hear someone\u2019s full Christian name used at 2:03 a.m. in a liquor store, so we put down our cards, cocked our eyebrows, and went to investigate. We felt no fear \u2014 after all, Stephen figured out a way to gain 26 life by turn three, and that\u2019s the kind of accomplishment that extinguishes mortal terror.\nYou could take some big hits with that much life.\nAt first, we just saw the man\u2019s back as he faced Nick. He was taller than any of us, and thin. He wore a neat, black blazer. His shoes were polished and his hair was coiffed. We saw Nick trembling, clutching the sides of the cash register as if it were his only tether to this earth.\nWhen we saw that the intruder was real \u2014 made of flesh, not printed on cardboard \u2014 our heroism shattered. We thought, What if this guy has a gun?\nThe man turned to face us. People who looked like that would not wield something as uncouth as a gun. People who looked like that were usually video game mini-bosses armed with a sword cane and some henchmen.\nIt was a handsome face, but two bony protrusions like antlers attached to his jaw beneath his ears. They extended six inches past his face, curving slightly inward toward his mouth, and they had a waxy, red shine.\nThe man wore a blood-colored clerical collar. The man did not blink as he swept his eyes over us and laughed. His mandibles flexed. (We knew that these were called mandibles because Stephen went through an entomology phase a few years back.) They looked elegant, like polished wood.\n\u201cBoys, you should go,\u201d Nick told us. He cleared his throat. \u201cNow.\u201d\nWe just stood there. We stared at Nick. We could see sweat begin to bloom in the center of his t-shirt. We stared at the man and his mandibles and his collar. We wondered, despite everything, which denomination he belonged to.\nThe man spoke again, and beneath his voice, we heard a riot of clicking sounds, like a complicated, straining machine.\n\u201cDo not worry about them, Nicholas. I am only a scout. But we will return for you.\u201d\nThe man grinned, and his mandibles snapped together, and he fell apart.\nIt began with his fingertips and his toes and the top of his head. His body dropped off in pieces, and we realized that each splintered chunk was a stag beetle, whole and squirming. Some beetles were deep red, and others were black. They sounded like handfuls of marbles clattering to the floor, and once they dropped, they began to scuttle towards the open door.\nBut once the man was beetles, we could do something to stop him, and so we did. Why not? We now suspected Nick had a backstory full of dubious morality, but he was a good guy.\nNoah ran to the door and heaved it shut. He stretched to grab a broom and began to brush the beetles toward the rest of us like some sort of hockey player. This flipped some of the beetles over, and their legs pedaled in vain. The others began to scatter.\nWe stomped. They crunched.\nNick seemed to be in shock, but after we killed the first dozen or so, he came out from behind the counter wielding a can of Raid. We went through the Blood and turned over boxes and peered between bottles and looked beneath displays, and whenever we found a beetle, we crunched it beneath the soles of our tennis shoes or smashed it with some of the more expendable bottles.\nWe got them all, and then we got to work putting everything back and sweeping the hundreds of beetle carcasses into dustpans and then into the trash.\nWe mopped up, too. And with the six of us, it didn\u2019t take long.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Mosquitoes hover like dust motes as I climb the porch steps. That my key still fits the lock surprises me; that no one appears to greet me breaks my heart again, as I knew it would.\nI am home. (at last)\nBetween the time I left and this return is a chain of moments, a bridge between then and now, each link fitting snugly together. A bridge paved in blood and regret; if I had known (we knew)\nif I had known how it would end\u2014me here, alone in this dusty, decrepit house\n(oh we knew)\n\u2014would I still have done what I did?\n(yes)\nI cannot answer.\nThe hall is cool and dim. The first thing I see is the large family photograph hanging over the credenza, a piece of cobwebbed black silk wound around its frame. Had they ever stopped mourning? Losing first my brother, then myself. No parent should outlive their child, the lawyer had said. Did he mean my brother, or us both?\nAll their sorrow. Yet I still feel a hint of pride, that I could so utterly destroy another human being.\n(oh yes at last)\nI put my bag down on the credenza and breathe in the musty air. All these years and still there is a smell as familiar as my own. I take another deep breath and for a moment the sound seems to double, as if the house itself is sighing, perhaps in disappointment: oh it\u2019s you. (us\nat last)\nAs I turn into the living room I get a shock, so swift and violent my heart lurches. The curtains are the same lacy panels that were hanging that night, as bright and clean as they were twenty years ago.\n(sweetness)\nThe same curtains. I can feel them still, feel the rough edges of the lace against my palms as I pushed them apart to watch the police creeping towards the house, their badges and guns gleaming in the dappled moonlight. Watching and knowing it was all for me, for me alone, their fear and their guns and their strange hand gestures that I had thought were a fiction of the movies.\n(all for us) (at last sweetness)\nI go to the window and slowly draw the curtains apart and glance to the side, as I had done that night, and I see again the decorative table covered with framed photographs. My mother\u2019s pride. How did I come to be this, how did this I emerge from that smiling, rosy-cheeked cocoon?\n(oh we know\nwe know)\nAll the photos are exactly as they were. The wide lawn is empty and sweetly reddened by the sun. I feel a sudden, wrenching spasm of loss, as I have not felt since the trial. All that I might have been, had I not \u2026\n(you are)\nWhere did that smiling girl go, where did she go, and could I ever get her back?\n(come\nfind out)\n#\nI fill box after box: clothes, books, keepsakes that I cannot take. The furniture will be hauled away next week. I\u2019m not sure which are more disturbing, the familiar things or the ones I don\u2019t recognize at all. Life went on without me, in spite of the lace curtains and the black silk.\n(waiting always)\nWhen I find the scrapbooks of the trial, I unscrew the posts and burn the pages one by one in the bright blue flame of the gas stove, watching the pages curl and flake\n(always sweetness)\nbreathing in the acrid smoke of old glue, feeling nothing.\nLater, when I am puzzling over my parents\u2019 papers, I find yet another clipping\u2014one of the first articles, a short statement of what happened framing a photo of the car. (at last) I cannot read the words, but I find myself cupping my hands, as if I was driving. The feel of the steering wheel. I had started up the car, and \u2026\n(at last) (yes)\nBut I had expected this, I had planned for this with my therapist. I perform the little rituals we had concocted, breathing and tapping, calming myself. Only then do I realize that all the papers before me\u2014trusts and wills and certificates, the lists of accounts in my father\u2019s neat hand\u2014they all date to just after the trial, when I had gotten on that plane thinking never to return. These pages were never meant for me; they were made in the grim hope that my brother would recover, that my parents would still have one child left to them.\n(we are\ncome)\nAnd yet he is gone, and I am here. The feel of the steering wheel in my hands. (at last) The impact like a force of nature. (at last we know) And then \u2026\nAnd then \u2026\n(darkness) (us we are sweetness at last)\nBut as always, my memories become blurred, a shaky cutaway that no therapist, no psychologist, no threat has ever been able to undo.\n(at last home)\n#\n(come)\nIt is late when I make my way upstairs. I cannot bear to go in my bedroom, I cannot bear to look in my brother\u2019s; instead I carry my things into the little guest room that had once been my mother\u2019s sewing room. So crowded with junk that I do not see the photo at first, hanging in an alcove as if it were a shrine\n(darkness see)\nmy brother and I, long before it happened. (see us) Smiling and holding hands on our wide, sunny lawn \u2026\n(see) yet there is something in my eyes even then, the first glimmer of hurt and a cold anger, and something else that I still cannot name.\n(hungry)\nWhat did I gain from it all? In twenty years I have never had a proper relationship, never been able to hold a job for more than a few months. My life is perpetually behind a scrim, everything around me washed in grey.\n(at last\nwe are)\nI long to reach into that photo and seize that younger me, seize her and shake her, make her understand how it will change everything.\n(sweetness we know)\nI reach for the photo, to do \u2026 something, but then I hesitate. Was it really there, so many years before? (at last) All this time I\u2019ve told myself, told everyone, it was an act of rage, pure and sudden: the swift eruption of a hundred bottled emotions. But in this photo I am looking at my brother as if he\u2019s already dead, and I am (hungry)\nsmiling.\nPerhaps I should call my therapist and tell her about the picture \u2026 but what good would it do, save to give her incentive to put me away for good?\n(you we are) (at last)\nThe silent, breathing house. The dead heat of the night. I suddenly want to leave, just grab my things and walk out and never return. But who else would take care of it all, who would give my parents this last consideration? I can\u2019t abandon them again.\n(oh we know darkness) (at last)\n#\nThat night I dream as I have not dreamed in years, not since I last slept in this house. I dream of my brother\u2019s vast, dark form looming over me; as I wait, rigid with anticipation, he spreads black wings that blot out the light.\n(waiting at last we know\noh sweetness hungry)\n(come) (home find out)\n(we know the sweetness\nthe sweetness oh we are\noh at last)\nAnd then it is no longer my brother who comes to me but another, something at once familiar and utterly strange that smothers me with its silken body, entwining its limbs with mine and weaving about us its long, soft tail until I cannot tell where I end and it begins.\n(love)\n#\nThe man presses the doorbell then knocks again, sharp raps that echo in the house like gunshots. With his free hand he clutches a briefcase; his eyes dart from side to side as if anticipating an assault. I watch him through the curtains, watching him come for me.\n(at last we see)\nIn the window (we) see the reflection of a middle-aged woman whose eyes don\u2019t match her smile, who looks at the man as if he\u2019s already dead. (sweetness)\n(hungry)\n(yes)\nHe draws his phone out of his pocket; a moment later the house fills with ringing, a deafening clamor that makes me cringe. He looks at the window and I jerk backwards, at once afraid and angry. How dare he just show up. (how dare) he think he can do as he pleases. (how dare he) as my brother dared.\n(we know\noh we know) That night. He had said, I\u2019m going to show them what you wrote to me. (see) Who do you think they\u2019ll believe? I have photos, I know what you do when you think no one\u2019s looking. (see at last) All his life, making me do what he wanted, and when I finally worked up the courage to tell him what I really was he twisted me into something monstrous.\n(darkness oh we are) (you)\nBetween now and then is a chain of moments, each fitting tightly into the next, spiraling back to that night when I followed him in the car. The feel of the steering wheel in my hands. His body flying up and back and disappearing into the (darkness), as easy as tossing aside a wrapper.\n(sweetness at last\nhungry)\nI\u2019d stopped then. (darkness) I had not thought past that moment; I had not thought. But my father had taught me how to change a tire. (we) knew exactly where the jack was. The (hungry) had felt like power, like strength. All that I was capable of.\n(sweetness) (yes)\nI never left behind the smiling girl in the photos; I dragged her with me all these years, her dead eyes and the smothering weight of her pretense. For the camera I smiled but I could not hide what was behind my eyes, that (sweetness) winged and nursing on every moment he made me less. Until I swung the jack and felt (us) burst forth (at last).\n(we were are at last)\n(always)\nI hear a voice then, dulled by the closed windows: the man says, are you sure she\u2019s here.

Happy Halloween.","hostname":"fabulistmagazine.com","source":"https:\/\/fabulistmagazine.com\/non-ego-te-absolvo\/","sitename":"The Fabulist Words & Art","text":"That first half year in the parish of Santo Seb\u00e1stian, Father Ambrose was afraid.\nHe feared the vast New Mexican spaces beyond the church door; he feared the scorpions he was told might sometimes hide in his shoe; he feared the howling of what he imagined were great hordes of coyotes surrounding the rectory at night.\nBut most of all he feared a call from the Archdiocese of Chicago, from the prelates who had sent him to Santo Seb\u00e1stian, men who might change their minds and conclude that even this speck in the desert was not small enough nor far enough away in which to safely bury him alive.\nHe knelt in his room and gazed through the window at the crimson moon and prayed that the blood of the crucified Christ would absolve him. And the wind from the desert hissed Ego te absolvo.\nBut by the end of the first year, his fear thinned to anxiety. Soon the anxiety faded to worry, and within three months of the second year the worry had dwindled to an occasional unease and glance over his shoulder.\nThe desert was vast, but largely empty. He had only once found a scorpion in his shoe and he squashed it. He\u2019d grown accustomed enough to the song of the coyotes to sit on the rectory porch at night and listen as he smoked.\nAnd the men in the Archdiocese of Chicago never called. Father Ambrose realized that they were willing to let him rot in peace.\n\u201cRequiescat in pace,\u201d whispered Father Ambrose, and slept soundly.\nFather Ambrose had grown used to the parishioners, and they to him.\nThey were small in number and seemed suspicious of him, content to keep their problems to themselves, for which Father Ambrose was grateful. Less than fifty came to mass on Sunday, except on Christmas and Easter, when the congregation swelled to a hundred or so. There was one baptism and one requiem mass; now and then a request for a visit to the sick or elderly.\nAnd on days when Father Ambrose felt more like his former self, in control, confident in the old invincible way, he would visit the little Catholic elementary school and spend time with the children.\nDespite all the problems they had caused him, children still afforded him much pleasure. The ones who had betrayed him, he forgave, and the many boys and girls who had kept silent, the silence that he taught them was golden, he blessed with all his heart and prayed for nightly.\nThere was a boy named Carlos in whom Father Ambrose took a particular interest. He was small for twelve and afflicted with a stutter. As Father Ambrose had often seen before, Carlos was the kind of boy who brought out the worst instincts in the children who were predisposed to them.\nChildren, Father Ambrose knew, could be beasts.\nCarlos roused in Father Ambrose protective and nurturing feelings, however misinterpreted by others. And of course he was a beautiful child, with his deep chocolate eyes and black hair and the shy smile of an angel.\nHe approached Carlos\u2019s mother, a young widow, with a suggestion. He told her that a stutter could often be helped by learning a musical instrument. He himself played the clarinet and would be glad to give Carlos lessons. He recommended twice a week in the church. He would take the boy after school and when they were finished would drive him home.\nCarlos\u2019s mother hesitated, but Father Ambrose assured her it would benefit the boy not just with his stutter, but spiritually as well. Carlos seemed to like Father Ambrose, and so his mother consented.\nThey would begin next week.\nAll that week Father Ambrose spent in feverish anticipation. He had been too long denied the company of young souls who yearned for spiritual enlightenment and support. And Carlos was doubly handicapped, not just by his stutter, but in the lack of a father figure, a role Father Ambrose knew he played skillfully.\nHe would leave the boy better than he\u2019d found him, however it turned out, and anyway, whatever he did was surely the will of God, or why else would he be permitted to do it? To prepare he would fast, fast and pray, and allow God\u2019s light to fill him with divine guidance, as it had done so many times in the past.\nFather Ambrose knelt before the altar and prayed out loud to the large wood crucifix where hung the melancholy Christ, painted in garish colors by a long dead parishioner, with ample droplets of blood around the crown of thorns and leaking from the wounds in his hands, feet, and side.\nNo matter how hard he prayed, Father Ambrose found he was besieged by intrusive thoughts of a less than spiritual nature. Perhaps, he thought, he was praying too hard and should give his soul a rest, break his fast, and indulge in a little bread and wine, as Christ himself was well known to do.\nHe rose and turned and from the corner of his eye saw something move in the shadows in back of the church.\n\u201cHello?\u201d he called.\nOf course, no one answered. He knew he was alone. But as he walked toward the door to the rectory he had the distinct feeling that something was indeed lurking in the shadows.\n\u201cIf someone is there, come out immediately. This is a house of prayer, not a playground.\u201d\nAnd with that, a child stepped out of the shadows.\nFather Ambrose stared in amazement. It was Carlos, but not as he had ever seen him. The boy was in a white tunic and barefoot. His eyes and hair and unblemished skin were dark but shone with a radiant light. He smiled shyly and motioned to Father Ambrose to follow him.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here, Carlos? Where are you going?\u201d\nBut the boy did not answer. He walked slowly out of the church. Father Ambrose rushed to follow him.\nEven though Father Ambrose hurried and Carlos walked slowly, he could not seem to catch up. He followed Carlos along the dark road away from the church and into the desert.\n\u201cCarlos,\u201d he called and the boy turned momentarily and gestured to him to follow.\nFather Ambrose used the light on his phone to guide his footsteps over the cold desert floor. The desert was flat, yet he seemed to be moving downhill.\n\u201cCarlos, for God\u2019s sake, come back!\u201d\nThough he had not been walking long, Father Ambrose had apparently gone a long way, for the lights of the church were dim and distant. He was cold, but the thought of the beautiful child warmed him and he plodded on.\nFinally, Carlos stopped. Father Ambrose turned once more to look at the church, but it was gone. And when he returned his gaze to Carlos, he saw nothing.\nThe child too was gone.\nOverhead the sky, which should have been speckled with stars, was black. Father Ambrose began to be afraid, just as he had been when he first came to Santo Seb\u00e1stian.\nHe turned around and around and shone the dim light from his phone over the landscape. The light went out. The phone was dead.\n\u201cCarlos!\u201d\nAs his eyes grew accustomed to the dark, he found himself at the bottom of a hollow; surrounding the round rim were eyes, an ocean of eyes \u2014 luminous, scarlet, staring at and surrounding him, slowly moving down the slopes from all directions.\n\u201cMerciful Christ!\u201d he cried.\nA dreadful howling filled the night, heart-rending cries, a high-pitched wailing of anguish and wrath.\nFather Ambrose fell to his knees and covered his ears as the wave of coyotes broke over him in a black deluge.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

This year, they were going about one hundred miles south and slightly east, away from the sea and toward the desert to spend Christmas Eve with her family.\nIt was the first time he\u2019d be spending an entire evening with her extended family. To be honest, James was never even that thrilled about spending the holiday with his own family, but he was going to be a dutiful boyfriend.\nAnd apparently a driver.\nLoading the car with presents was an easy blur, but when he climbed behind the wheel, he felt the seat tingle. He was able to hide it in the stop-and-start traffic heading through downtown toward the freeway, but that changed about fifteen minutes into the drive.\nAs the car passed the big buildings, he watched the shadows slither into each other, claustrophobia-close, as if anticipating some enormous beast about to stalk through the heart of the city.\nThere was a flash of light that obscured his vision. He felt lightheaded and chilled, his body momentarily drained of heat.\nThen it was over, as sharply as it came on him. His gut felt slightly dislodged and his head was pulsing, but he figured these were discomforting residual effects.\nMary, fiddling with her phone, hadn\u2019t seemed to have noticed.\nIt was probably a combination of lack of sleep, free-floating holiday anxiety and, admittedly, the vodka couldn\u2019t have helped.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry sweetheart, but I don\u2019t feel so good,\u201d he announced.\nMary looked at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel well?\u201d she asked softly.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t sleep that great. I\u2019m sorry. Can you take the wheel in a bit?\u201d\n\u201cDo you want to stop now?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s get closer to the freeway first.\u201d\nThey spent four hours on the freeway \u2014 it should have been two, but they started late and the tangle of holiday traffic was unavoidable at any hour \u2014 so it was midafternoon by the time they got to her parents\u2019 home.\nBy then James felt up to driving, so he piloted, guided by her short, gentle directions, the remaining miles to their destination.\nIt was a ranch-style building, squat and broad, unpretentious on a large piece of land that was marked off by a chain-link fence, delineated from the suburbs in one direction and the first snarls of prairie in the other.\nThe house itself, all sunburnt yellows and afternoon grays, seemed unsure of which side of that border it belonged to and blended uneasily into both landscapes.\nThey parked at a makeshift curb, set in dirt and crumbling into concrete dust, gathered their pile of token presents, and made their way across the empty street to the house.\nThe place really did hum with the holiday. James could hear music, indistinct but palpable, and the senseless chatter of guests. Mary opened the gate, his arms loaded with bags and boxes, guided him toward the door, rang the bell, and was rewarded half a minute later by her mother, a woman who matched the house perfectly.\n\u201cMaria!\u201d she exclaimed, embracing her child and leading her in, leaving James on the doorstep. He peeked around the presents and followed them through the threshold. Her father, a compact but sturdy man with prematurely gray and receded hair, observed him.\n\u201cHello sir,\u201d James said.\n\u201cHello James,\u201d her father said, grinning but making no move to help.\nAfter a moment, James laughed lightly. \u201cWhere can I put these down?\u201d\nThroughout the afternoon, James followed Mary around the house, attaining independence for a little while to chat with one of her brothers about his future. This brother was studying marine biology at a coastal college, already lining up internships.\nJames, who had not had an internship in years, did not have much to contribute. After a few minutes, Mary found him and plucked him from the jaws of the conversation.\nShe led him through the house, conversing with a growing number of friends and relatives, while he carried a bottle of beer, which he held close to his chest like a prop, feeling it go from refrigerator chilled to room temperature while the afternoon darkened into desert night.\nAs the evening went on, it became clear to James that no one ever left this party, and the friends and extended family were growing by leaps and bounds.\nThe building too appeared to be growing, with new hallways and side rooms bursting like fresh limbs from the nucleus of the house.\nAt least, that was the only way James could explain the increased crush of revelers. James and Mary passed the kitchen and he paused to grab a new beer. When he turned around, Mary had vanished, replaced by a group of people talking amongst themselves.\nHe started to ask them where she had gone, but they burst out laughing before he could open his mouth.\nThere is a difference between being lost in a crowd at a large, informal social gathering, like a theme park or a shopping mall, and being lost in a crowd that is all focused on something that you are not.\nJames learned this very quickly, trying to spot his Mar in a sea of unfamiliar and disorientingly similar faces. The temperature in the house went up, and the volume of the music did not go down.\nAfter a few minutes, he gave up trying to find Mary and simply looked for an empty seat. He finally spotted one \u2014 a big chair shoved right up against a wall, and made his way to it, chuckling under his breath as he sat down.\nHis forehead was sprinkled with sweat, and he placed his beer bottle against it, feeling the condensation on his skin.\nHe tried to take in the scene. If nothing else, he could wait here. The chair was comfortable enough. It was wood, as heavy and black as bad dreams, and it looked old and hand-carved.\nJames saw that there was a matching chair beside him, identical in every way except its occupant: an old man with skin as thin and delicate as the chair was solid. The hair on his head and face was also thin but long, with all the grace of wild grass.\nJames made no sound, but the old man looked up. His cheeks were sunken, and his eyes were blue and far too clear.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see you come in,\u201d he said at last.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware you were watching,\u201d James said.\nThe old man shrugged. \u201cIt is better to watch. I learned that a long time ago.\u201d\nJames considered this, but before he had a comment, the old man sucked in a great, preparatory breath.\n\u201cMany years ago,\u201d he began, \u201cperhaps when I was as old as you, I was traveling by bus from El Paso, I think, to Los Angeles. It was a long time ago, and it was a long ride, but I remember some things quite well. Everything was gold then. The light was gold, and the station was gold.\u201d\nJames nodded and sank into his chair.\n\u201cThe last stop I remember was Tucson, where people got off and people got on. Other men like me. There was a pretty young woman with a yellow hat.\u201d He smiled at this. \u201cChildren. I remember children. And there was a man who was dressed in expensive clothes, like the boss of a big ranch.\n\u201cI fell asleep somewhere on the way to Phoenix. I must have. When I woke up, I did not know what time it was or where exactly the bus was, but we must have been on the way to Indio. It was quite night, and the moon was fat and purple, like a stain. There were no more children on the bus. Or the woman with the yellow hat.\n\u201cThere was still the rancher and another man, someone who I hadn\u2019t seen before. Maybe he got on the bus in Phoenix. Or maybe he had always been there and I hadn\u2019t seen him. I couldn\u2019t say then and I can\u2019t say now.\n\u201cOutside the window, I couldn\u2019t tell where I was. The land was desert, all desert. It was night, but everything was the color of twilight. The cactus was twilight. The dust was twilight. Everything.\n\u201cI did what you do when you wake up. I tried to stretch without moving.\u201d Here, the old man spat a laugh, as prickly as the cactus in his desert. \u201cTo sleep on a bus. I thought I knew what it meant to feel stiff.\n\u201cWithout moving my head, I looked at the man I had not seen before.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did he look like?\u201d James interrupted. The old man considered.\n\u201cHe dressed like someone from a Hollywood movie. Rolled up white shirt and denim pants. But the clothes didn\u2019t fit him right. Like he was shaped wrong inside them.\u201d\nJames nodded slowly.\n\u201cI looked at him,\u201d the old man said after a pause, \u201cwithout looking. My eyes were almost closed. People on a bus, late at night, they don\u2019t like to be bothered sometimes. You can\u2019t always tell who wants to talk and who doesn\u2019t.\n\u201cThis man, he didn\u2019t look like he wanted to talk. He was staring at the other man, the rancher. They were not moving, like me. But I saw they wanted to kill each other.\u201d\nSuddenly, there was a rush and a roar from where James assumed was the kitchen, followed by the smell of burning grease. The old man paid it no attention, and James was forced to lean in to hear his words.\n\u201cHow did you know they wanted to kill each other?\u201d\n\u201cTheir eyes,\u201d the old man answered. He made a motion with his hand, like he was trying to pull an invisible force off his face. \u201cThey were staring like they could kill with their eyes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n\u201cNothing. I did not want to get between them. And I could not get to the bus driver without crossing them. The driver was at the front of the bus, down a few steps and behind a kind of cage. I could not even see him. But I stopped thinking about the driver when the men started to growl.\u201d\n\u201cGrowl?\u201d\n\u201cAt first, when I heard the sound, I thought it was the bus. Like something grinding down below, rising to the top. Men do not make a sound like that. I did not think they could. But as the sound became louder, I knew it had to be these men. They started to claw at their clothes, like insects plagued their skin. One man began to tear at his shirt, but before he could get it off, his body burst through his clothes.\n\u201cI did not feel like I could move, but very slowly, I turned my head to look at the window. I wanted to see if I could escape. The bus was moving fast now, very fast. And the window was solid. I could not open it. I could not break it. Even if I could, what would I do? If I escaped the bus, I did not know where I was. I would be in the desert, lost and alone. It was impossible.\n\u201cVery slowly, I turned back. I pretended to be asleep. It did not matter. What I saw then, I could not move at all. I could not believe it, and cannot believe it now. These men were turning into wolves.\u201d\nThe old man was no longer looking at James \u2014 he could not say when the old man had shifted his gaze \u2014 but instead was looking into the crowd. His eyes softened, and his jaw quivered with a terrible delicacy.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey were not wolves. They were something worse than wolves.\u201d\nJames\u2019s mouth felt dry. The warmth of the room took on an uncomfortable weight.\nHe licked his lips, feeling their chapped and jagged surface.\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\nThe old man sighed and dropped his shoulders.\n\u201cWhat could I do? There was nothing to do. I did not know what the creatures wanted. Were they going to fight each other? If they were, would the winner be satisfied, or would he turn on me? Would the creatures decide I was easier prey? Did they know I was awake?\n\u201cThere was no way off the bus. It rolled along, faster and faster. I didn\u2019t know how the driver couldn\u2019t hear these men. Maybe he wasn\u2019t there. More and more they changed. Teeth and fangs. Skin and fur. Clothes in shreds on the floor of the bus. Claws and talons. As slowly as I could, I pushed myself back into my seat, trying to disappear. I could not. I don\u2019t make a sound. I don\u2019t breathe. I wait for these men, these things. I wait. I wait.\u201d\nThe old man stopped and smiled. He actually smiled. James saw his teeth \u2014 yellow and lined like discarded newspaper, all present and too solid.\n\u201cJames!\u201d He sat straight up. This was not the old man\u2019s voice but Mary\u2019s.\nShe had found him. James rose and saw her emerging from the crowd and walking toward him. Her dark eyes were wide and wet. When she was close enough that she no longer had to shout, she simply said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you would do that to me.\u201d\nDespite the heat of the room, an icy tingle descended James\u2019s body and froze him in place.\n\u201cDo what?\u201d he said at last.\nShe ignored this. \u201cCome on,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cWe\u2019re going home.\u201d\n\u201cBut what did I do? What did I do?\u201d\nHer only answer was to turn and cut her way back into the crowd.\nJames started after her, but he paused long enough to look back at the old man. He was no longer smiling. Instead, he had slumped back into the chair, eyes barely open, another piece of furniture, separate and ignored by the crowd.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

The dog on her long leash will decapitate them, leaving bare spongy stalks. I try to make certain there are always enough to form a circle. Still, she will slip her leash and go tearing off through town and I wonder, who did she hear calling?\nTwo\nAt dusk, or in the early morning fog, a doorway will open up. The path that normally loops through a copse of trees to the shed will no longer take you to your destination. A cool breeze in the heat, calling you deeper in the woods. Sometimes it\u2019s the way the light falls, the glinting of an ethereal beauty. It\u2019s a clear invitation and that\u2019s exactly why it should be given a wide berth.\nThree\nIt\u2019s important to acknowledge that if you\u2019ve actually seen something looking back at you, it\u2019s already too late.\nFour\nMy wife dreams of a boat appearing in the pond. It\u2019s blue, she says, and floats soundless on the water. I beg her to ignore such a thing, if it ever appears outside of dreams, but I can see that she would climb right in, disregarding her feet getting wet as she wades out, or the fact that the pond is too small for a boat to go anywhere farther than a few paddle strokes away.\nFive\nI am not very clumsy, but I trip frequently in the yard on small tip-toe-sized holes. I spill tea from my otherwise steady hand. I dump the water I was refilling for the chickens all over my feet. It\u2019s not so much I feel someone is watching, but that someone is laughing.\nSix\nThere are ferns I do not trim and clusters of wildflowers I do not mow over, even if it leaves odd patches on the lawn.\nSeven\nI worry about saying my daughter\u2019s name too loudly when we\u2019re playing outside, but I tell myself there must be some rule of deliberateness, that overhearing isn\u2019t enough to snatch power. She disappears under the arc of an overgrown holly bush. \u201cThe trees will keep us warm, Mommy,\u201d she says, and I know she\u2019s already beloved by someone other than me.\nEight\nWe lose a chick in the thick undergrowth. Instead of heading for the door of her coop, she dashes off away from her sisters. We can hear her cheeping, panicked, but she is only palm-sized and an instinctive hider. The full moon is out, though it isn\u2019t yet dark, and in desperation, I plead in clumsy rhyme for help finding her, offering to put out a bowl of milk for her safe return. She rustles and runs and I snatch her up. I put out a pink bowl of half-and-half in the dark later that night. It seems untouched in the morning, but I still see the trampled foot paths where we hunted for her weeks after growth should have erased them.\nNine\nDo not close your eyes outside in the dark. Do not step unawares into the morning fog. Always keep your desire to return home in the forefront of your mind.\nTen\nThe crows fly by and caw from the trees but never land on our grass. I wish I could understand what they\u2019re trying to tell me. But if they told me to leave, I\u2019m not sure I could.

Yet when seen over the span of decades, the supernatural horror at the heart of Julia Patt\u2019s fine telling ends up being almost beside the point. \u2014 Editor.\nOld woman Sawyer at the end of the cul-de-sac kept a demon under her porch, the big kids said. She\u2019d let you have a look at it for a dollar.\nThird grade, eight of us saved a day\u2019s lunch money and went.\nShe was the oldest person we\u2019d ever seen, her face a territory of dry sunk riverbeds. But while her skin had long ago gone a gray-khaki color, her lips were always pink and wet and uncomfortable to look at. Usually we skirted her property \u2014 she\u2019d chased Billy Corvin away with a hammer once \u2014 but that October day we went up and knocked on her door.\nWe followed her around the porch, which was closed up with a little white-latticed gate at the far end. Old woman Sawyer looked at us with her penny-colored eyes; if you got close, she smelled of cough drops and rotting flowers. The door whined when she opened it.\nWe all stooped to peek in. It was hard to see at first. We squinted, tilted our heads. Connie Lemont spoke too soon; she said, You lying old witch, ain\u2019t no demon in there. The woman hawked and spat at Connie\u2019s feet and laid a curse on her.\n(Connie died years later, a little after junior prom, when she swerved into a guardrail on Route 29. Some said she\u2019d been drinking; others said it was that shitty old Pinto her parents gave her to drive. But the seven of us \u2014 who\u2019d been with her that October afternoon \u2014 we knew better.)\nJust after Connie spoke, we saw a shifting in the dark under the porch. It was a leathery little thing, old woman Sawyer\u2019s demon, the color of manila envelopes and the size of a baby, its shriveled face like the underside of a mushroom. It shuffled forward in the dark, dragged itself on hooked claws.\nThe demon pulled itself toward the sunlight, toward us, and as it got closer, we could see its eyes, a pale, beautiful blue \u2014 opaque like sea glass or river stones. It snuffled, sniffed for us. We shivered at the crumpled lunch bag sound of its breathing, flinched as it swung its head back and forth, listening for us.\nIt\u2019s blind, Tommy Leeds whispered and we all kicked him because the demon, it heard, and it shuffled fast toward us, rattled the dead leaves under the porch. It came so quick, Tommy fell back on his ass. We all jumped away.\nThe demon stuck its piggish snout out from under the porch and made a dry hungry sound, a kind of sucking. Its forked tongue dashed out of its mouth, as if tasting the place where we had been. It reached out with one hooked wing and then the old woman Sawyer clicked the little latticed door shut.\nThe old woman glared at us. Go on home now, she said. Turned away, muttered and grumbled and creaked up those porch steps and into her empty old house.\nWalking home, Lizzy Moors asked, What does it eat, then? And we shushed her but the question bothered us and we all lay awake thinking about it that night and the next and the next. Sometimes one of us would look like maybe they wanted to talk about it, but we\u2019d turn our backs when it came up.\nWhen we were seniors in high school and our little brothers and sisters had gone to see the demon and run home like we had, old woman Sawyer died. Her kids sold the house to a developer who wanted to split the property into smaller lots. So they tore it down. The whole thing collapsed in a pile of shingles and leaf dust.\nThat night we went parking up on Algiery Lane and kissed and held each other\u2019s hands and tugged each other close in our safe, locked-up cars. That was the night Tommy Leeds got Lizzy Moors pregnant, and none of us, none of us dreamed about a sick sucking sound or the rattling of flightless wings in the leaves. Or if we did, we never admitted to it.\nWe did go to the house the next day, went walking past it before school to have a look. Not just us from that third grade class either. Lots of kids, all ages, some adults even. But there wasn\u2019t anything in the dirt or in the leaves. No furrows, as we\u2019d imagined, leading away from the old property. The tiny body dragging, dragging.\nAfter that the rabbits and chipmunks and stray cats began to come back. We got older, moved away from the neighborhood, went off to college and cul-de-sacs of our own. Never thought about demons closed in under porches, didn\u2019t tell our friends over drinks or our lovers across the pillows or our children when we tucked them in.\nBut sometimes we would pause late at night, listening for the sound of it breathing, not sure whether we heard it or only remembered. Sometimes we dreamed about Connie Lemont and we picked up the phone, thought of calling someone who might understand. We always went back to bed without dialing.\nThe summer of the twenty-year reunion we stood around talking awkwardly about divorces and foreclosures and failed business ventures. Were shocked at how we looked so much alike: our faces wrinkled prematurely, the skin loose and gray, our eyes blank and pale.\nThe group of us left, our significant others abandoned at tables and buffet lines and punch bowls, our hands clasped together.\nWe went to what had been old woman Sawyer\u2019s place. The little lines of plastic houses looked weathered and stained, windows dark, lawns overgrown, for-sale signs leaning crooked at the curb. We stood in the street over the gutter. We waited for the demon to come back, waited to see its eyes catch the moonlight, waited to hear it breathe.\nIt would know us, we were sure. Beneath the suits and the heels and the years layered like sediment, it would recognize us by taste and smell and sound, would know us for what we were. Seven children peering into the dark.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

She usually pops back up around now, either drunk or looking to drink, and it\u2019s probably best if she doesn\u2019t find them mucking around with some filthy thing Stella brought off the street.\nStella\u2019s looking at him now though, her eyes wide and wet with eager anticipation, a little patch of sunlight illuminating the thin scar that cuts across her forehead. Raoul scrunches his mouth up and takes a step forward out of the doorway.\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s ask it what you\u2019re going to be when you grow up, Stell. You\u2019re always saying you want to be a plumber, but who knows,\u201d and he lifts his hands like he saw in a movie, \u201cbut who knows what the crystal ball will say.\u201d\nStella squeals in laughter for a second, and then stops, suddenly serious, all of her nine-year-old attention coming to bear.\n\u201cLet\u2019s ask where dad is and if he\u2019s ever coming back.\u201d\nRaoul doesn\u2019t say yes or no, he just sits down on the dirty stretch of carpet between the end of the bed and the bay window stoop.

Raoul feels the globe suddenly grow warm, hears Stella gasp quietly and then a wave of sounds and images hop, skip, jump across his brain.\nHe hears his mother and father, drunk, and laying in to each other on the street in front of the hotel. He sees them in the light of the doorway, their arms locked in something between a hug and a wrestling hold.\nHe sees Stella then standing next to them, younger then, a little more innocent, her arms reaching up.\nHis mom curses and her father swings his arm wildly, striking Stella in the forehead, the corner of his watch making contact with a fleshy thump.\nHe hears a scream and sees a flash of something wet and red and sees Stella fall and his father, quickly too sober for the moment, throw his arms up and bellow like a sick animal before screaming a final \u201cfuck you\u201d to their mom and charging down the stairs.\nHe sees Stella sitting on the ground screaming and his mom trying not to sway saying, \u201cOh baby, it\u2019ll be okay,\u201d over and over again.\nAnd then the images and sounds are gone.

Now the boy is alone except for the crows, but they offer no comfort other than their knowledge of his way home.\nHe doesn\u2019t know why he knows that\u2019s where they are taking him. He simply trusts that it is so.\nHe is too stunned to think much about it. He was walking with his mother, the most beautiful woman in the village, maybe the whole country, perhaps the world, a woman of light and softness and warmth. They were deep in the woods, further than he\u2019d ever been before. It was a windless night, yet leaves shimmered and trembled and trees swayed as if in the breeze, or to music. Birds woke and broke into song, deer trailed behind them, arboreal animals, eyes bright in wonder, watched them from the trees.\nHis mother was naked, her long hair swinging like a pendulum across her back and shoulders. She held his hand and it was warm and he felt no fear because she was with him.\nThe next moment, as if descended from stars, there was a rush of snowy white feathers. His mother was lifted in a pearly mist of feathers and starlight, radiant and opalescent, and vanished into the sky.\nHe was deep in the woods, deeper than he\u2019d ever been. It was night. He was alone. He was lost.\nNow come the crows. They drop low from the sky. Hundreds of them. Not raucous and harsh as a crows often are, but silent and shadowlike, their wings a soft, soothing whisper. They fly in formation, forming a darker arrow against darkness, only feet above the boy\u2019s head, arching and swerving along the windy path, slow and dreamy so the boy can keep pace.\nWhen he arrives home, the crows depart. Silent, they twist into a funnel like a feathered tornado, ascending wider and wider in an expanding circle until they disappear.\nTwo remain, roost in a branch in front of the house, their eyes glittering and intense, they watch like sentinels at the gates of a keep.\nThe boy feels a hollowness as empty and lonely as famine. He sits at the kitchen table. Early morning light floods into windows. He listens to water drip from the faucet in the sink.\nIn a daze, he hears a tap-tap-tapping at the door. A nosy neighbor? The police complaining about his mother causing more distraction and disharmony in the community?\nShe has history with the police. People are enchanted to damage and sometimes death by her beauty, her warmth and her light.\nHe rises, a weary dream of indifference, answers the door: There is no one.\nHe looks up and down the street. Empty and still. Too early for people to begin their daily routines. Too early for children to ride their bikes or walk to school.\nHe looks up to the trees. The two crows still stand sentry, observe him with dispassionate eyes.\nThe boy returns to the kitchen. Twists the tap at the sink. Halts the annoying drip. Again the tap-tap-tapping at the door.\nHe ignores it. Sits at the table, covers his ears, but he can\u2019t block the tapping at the door, which becomes louder, more insistent.\nTap tap tap. Tap tappity tap.\nHe rises. Clenches his fist. Walks to the door. Rips it open.\nNothing. Then \u2014 the crows caw and screech. Eyes twinkling. Laughing. He searches the veranda for a stone, a bottle, anything to throw. A crow takes wing; the other, still and silent, fixes him with cold eyes, challenges him.\nHe takes a tired breath, looks up and down the street.\nAnd there, perhaps a block away, a woman, old but not ancient, dressed in black flowing layers, draws nearer.\nThe crow flies before her. She pulls a cart behind her without effort. The crow perches in the branch next to its mate. The woman stops at his gate. Six eyes stare at him.\nDo you want something? the boy asks.\nYes, says the old woman. I want a boy with manners. Invite me in, she demands.\nAnd he does. He is overcome. After all, who wouldn\u2019t be? It\u2019s been a tough night. His mother has disappeared into the sky. He was left alone deep in the woods. Has no one to turn to and he\u2019s barely twelve years old.\nThe woman, dressed in black and friend of crows, somehow seems trustworthy and nonthreatening.\nShe opens the gate, enters, the cart follows. She looks up at him. Smiles.\nI\u2019m alone, he says. My mother disappeared in the sky. I\u2019m not certain what to do.\nHe doesn\u2019t cry. Not because he doesn\u2019t believe in crying. Not because the situation doesn\u2019t warrant tears \u2014 but because the woman is a stranger and tears are for those who are close.\nThe woman takes a square box from her cart, places it on the ground beneath the tree. Snaps her fingers. There\u2019s a buzz-buzz-buzzing. Bees emerge, forage among the flowers. She nods towards the tree. The two crows respond with caws and take wing.\nThere, she says. A gift from your mother. Now you know. You\u2019re never really alone.\nWhat\u2019s your name? he asks. Why are you here?\nCall me Grannie, she says. I don\u2019t mind. Don\u2019t worry, she cackles, I will enchant no one with my beauty and I\u2019m here because your mother is not. There are two sides to a coin. I\u2019m the other. She was a wisdom of light. I\u2019m a wisdom of dark. I\u2019m here to mind you. Mentor you. Provide the other half.\nThe boy is confused. After all, who wouldn\u2019t be? His face shows it.\nThe woman smiles and her laughter is joined by the crows.\nWhen some things end, others begin, she says, making her way towards the house. Now. Be a good lad and invite me in.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

The smell of sickness waited outside the room but didn\u2019t dare come inside.\n\u201cShooting stars are angels,\u201d she told me, as the evening shadows drew the shape of her motorized bed on the wall. Through the window, I thought I saw shooting stars, but they could have been reflections from the cars out in the parking lot.\nShe told me the shooting stars were emissaries of God, their holy fire igniting gasoline on deep water. She told me, and I believed, that they were angels falling, hair awash in liquid flame, too hot for any human to catch and hold.\nWhen I awoke the next morning there were no bodies. Just deep black stains all over the road, hot when I touched them, sucking at the backs of my heels. My mother said it was tar. I didn\u2019t believe her.\nI was in my room when the angel first spoke to me.\n\u201cI come from Heaven,\u201d it said. \u201cI need your help.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t know whether it was lying. I wasn\u2019t scared even though I felt small. Small, and not fit to walk on angelic, blessed ground. In the Bible story, Moses took off his sandals, because the ground was holy. I slipped off my high tops, as a precaution.\nAngels were holy, I knew.\nI stared as it perched on the top of my bunk bed. I had begged and pleaded with my parents for a bunk bed, but I was too scared to sleep on the top bunk just yet.\nNow the angel sat there.\n\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d I had asked.\nIt leaned close, and I felt heat, hot breath in my ear. It was the exact smell of pinon pines in the Sangre de Cristo mountains. The hot breath spoke of sprouting plants breaking through seed husks. It spoke of molten fire tearing through the foothills. It was the heat of the Earth itself, baked and cracked in the afternoon sun.\n\u201cStay with me,\u201d it said, and I nodded.\nWhat could be wrong with that?\nIts breath was in my ear as I played hopscotch with Jonathan from up the road, and its voice was in the sound of the wind chimes as I ate dinner with my parents. When I asked my parents to set a place for it, they just laughed. The wind chime echoed the dull quality of their voices.\nI don\u2019t think it wanted to leave me, not even when I had to go to school.\nBut.\nBut the angel wouldn\u2019t enter the church. It stopped at the door, moving away from the candles and Jesus, glass tears and real-looking blood around the crown of thorns and the nails in his hands.\n\u201cI won\u2019t go in,\u201d it said, and I shook my head. That didn\u2019t make sense.\n\u201cYou\u2019re an angel,\u201d I told it. Maybe the fall had knocked all the thoughts from its head.\nIt wouldn\u2019t come any nearer. I thought maybe it feared that musty church smell, the pews covered in burgundy. Maybe for the angel, the church was only a pale imitation of heaven, a facsimile, a dream.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to look,\u201d I said. \u201cYou can just look down at the floor.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t go in,\u201d it repeated, and stepped away from me.\nI took its hand. I had never touched it before. Its skin was cool, like sea glass. And then it was burning me, hotter than anything I\u2019d ever touched before, hotter than the campfires my dad made when we used to camp with my grandparents, when Grandpa was alive and Grandma wasn\u2019t in a home. When I pulled away, there was a raised white weal, like dripping wax, in the shape of its fingers.\nI did not cry.\nIt did not come with me when my family went to see Grandma that afternoon, either. As we left the edge of town, I saw it raise its hand.\nMy grandmother was sitting in one of the wheelchairs. She looked straight at the wooden cross on the wall.\n\u201cAngels watch over you,\u201d she said.\nAnd then she spoke of all the different angels. Angels clad in white. Angels like wheels within wheels, and angels covered in wings and eyes and the words holy, holy, holy. But she didn\u2019t describe anything like my angel.\n\u201cWhy do angels exist?\u201d I asked.\nHer hand swept my shoulder, more like a pine branch than anything else. I looked down, touched it. Her skin was soft and shiny, blurring around her wedding ring, her watch with its dotted sapphires. \u201cAngels guard you in all your ways.\u201d\nShe\u2019d always smelled of Lysol and of baking. Now she smelled like nothing and hospital soap. The smell clung to my clothes, even after we left the home.\nThe angel was waiting for us once we crossed back into town. The light was fading, and its shadow was long. Its eyes were flat, like deep water, but with a phosphorescent green flame eating away in their depths.\n\u201cWho are you waving to?\u201d my mother asked, but I could tell she didn\u2019t expect a reply.\nThe next morning, the top bunk was empty. I realized it as soon as the pale light broke through my window. I climbed up, felt the sheets. They were warm, as though they\u2019d just come out of the dryer. If I held them for too long, they would burn into my flesh. On the back of my hand, I still carried the angel\u2019s fingerprints, scorched remnants of its passing.\nI was already struggling to recall what the angel looked like. Despite my efforts to picture its face in my head, the image dissolved when I tried to grasp it, slippery as dreams after waking. I picked at the burn with a dirty fingernail.\nNew skin, frail as tissue paper, was already growing over the wound. It wrinkled in the morning light, like my grandmother\u2019s hands.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

He told us that we were looking for morel mushrooms, but he didn\u2019t tell us what they looked like. He just said to bring them home. We didn\u2019t ask any questions. He has a temper.\nSo we walk further and further but we don\u2019t find them and we know what is going on. We are not fools. Our parents have been itching to get rid of us ever since they met at the country line dance.\nYour mother is what my mother, who is now dead, would call a floozy or a two-bit whore. My father is crazy about fucking her. They send us outside to play and don\u2019t call us until after dark, and if we come home early, the door is locked.\nI am afraid that they have sent us here to be eaten by the witch. I have heard the stories from everyone in town that there is a woman in the forest who was previously called a witch. My English teacher says we are not supposed to use the term witch anymore because it\u2019s derogatory. Your mother just calls her an old whore. I\u2019ve heard she looks like a vulture, and she eats children, and she does whatever she wants, and she dances naked at night, and she has sex with men who go there. If she likes them she lets them live. If she doesn\u2019t she kills them.\nI have to admit I am very impressed by the witch. I like the fact that she dances naked. I like her killing the lovers. I wouldn\u2019t even mind if she killed some children, but not us. Maybe our father went there and had sex with her, I think. Maybe she didn\u2019t like him, but instead of killing him, he promised to send her two children.\nThis is the way I think. This is my dark mind. You have more level thoughts. You have logical thoughts. We share a certain hunger. We share a certain intimacy based on hunger. I know that you are alive and you know that I am alive.\nWe know that being alive is not such a certain thing, so we would do anything to stay that way. That is our pact.\nWe walk all day deeper and deeper, and instead of talking about the fact that we are in danger, we talk about food. We have been hungry for a long time. It\u2019s our favorite game.\nWe talk about mashed potatoes with deep pools of butter, foie gras, caviar and filet mingon. We talk about the kind of pastries that we read about in a book once called petit fours. I\u2019m not sure what those pastries are, but in the book they provided such pleasure for the girl and boy who were eating them, the kind of pleasure only food and a few other things can provide.\nSometimes we describe food to each other for hours. In our house, we eat only turnips, Wonder bread, cheese whiz and ring bologna. Our diet is limited and therefore our imagination is unlimited.\nYou are an attractive boy. I saw that when you first moved in. Me, I\u2019m not much of a looker, but you are sort of a boy-god\u2014the kind of child that many men in the trailer park want to be a big brother to. Your have light, curly hair like a cherubim and long eyelashes like a girl. If you weren\u2019t my stepbrother I would be in love with you. Maybe I am in love with you anyway.\n\u201cWhat should we have for lunch?\u201d I ask. We are sitting under a tree and taking a break from our fruitless hunting.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have lamb with plum sauce, Camembert cheese with blackberry pie and red wine,\u201d you say.\nI have never tasted any of these foods except blackberry pie, and that was at Denny\u2019s after grandma\u2019s funeral, and I don\u2019t think it was the best.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I say, \u201clet\u2019s have lobster thermidor, saut\u00e9ed escargot, cauliflower soup with white truffle oil and warm chocolate pudding.\u201d I have been studying old cooking magazines to impress you with culinary terminology.\nAll day we have been leaving a path of bread, just in case. Held in my hands all day, the bread becomes sticky and dirty.\nWhen my real mother was still alive, she would drive me past the Stroehman bread bakery, where we always stopped and sniffed the air to catch the yeasty smell of the bread loaves, sometimes catching a glance of them through the factory window, lying next to each other, row after row of small white bodies on endless metal trays. Being with my mother at such a time was special. Eating bread in the presence of one\u2019s mother is a very important thing. Now that my mother is dead, I have no one to eat bread in front of who matters.\nYou are hungry and I give you some bread that I have kept in my hand all day \u2014 Wonder bread pressed into the shape of my fingers. You eat it.\nWe look for the mushrooms all day but we don\u2019t find them. In my pocket, I keep a piece of my dead mother\u2019s nightgown. I take it out and smell it from time to time, but I have sniffed it so often that I can\u2019t tell if it still has her smell or I am imagining it. I remember how I sat on her lap, and she made me rice pudding from scratch and combed my hair, her fingers tickling my neck, making me feel like I was so light I might float away.\nAt dark we try to kill a rabbit. You throw a rock at it and it runs away. Instead we find a turtle. You brought some matches and we build a fire. We cook the turtle on a stick over the fire. The turtle is still alive when we start to cook it. It withdraws into its shell at first, but then when it realizes the danger, it tries to escape. I can\u2019t stand to watch it struggle. I think how horrible it must be to be cooked alive in your own shell \u2014 to have your own body turned into the oven that bakes you; there is no way out and going deeper inside only makes it worse.\nI only eat berries. You say maybe you\u2019ll want some in the morning. You save some of the turtle for me in case I\u2019m hungry later. I don\u2019t know then that in the morning, starving, I will cram the cold turtle into my mouth and chew and chew on the cold, rubbery flesh. It will taste wonderful.\nAs it gets dark, I become scared and see a woman with an axe in the shadows of the leaves. I believe the woman with the axe is real.\n\u201cNo,\u201d you say, \u201cit\u2019s not real.\u201d You have a way of separating hallucination from reality that is comforting to me\u2014 a way of separating the two like the wheat from the chaff. You are my winnower.\n\u201cAre you afraid?\u201d you ask me, your voice comforting.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I say, \u201cbut I\u2019m always afraid. Why do you think they sent us here?\u201d I always ask you things that I know.\n\u201cSo they could be free,\u201d you say.\nI like the way you say it. When you say it that way it doesn\u2019t sound so bad. Maybe my father does love me some, but just loves her more. Maybe he is setting me free too. But really I think he is an asshole.\n\u201cBut we\u2019re children,\u201d I say.\n\u201cExactly,\u201d you say, \u201cmy mother never wanted to have children. I was an accident. She tells me that sometimes when I got on her nerves. She just wants to be alone with Phil.\u201d\nPhil is my father. You have refused to call him father, of course. I never thought of him as much of a looker, but she is all over him.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I say, \u201cthey just want to have sex and listen to country music.\u201d\n\u201cAnd smoke joints.\u201d\n\u201cI should be sad, but I just feel scared,\u201d I say. Now that it is dark, the game is over. Maybe a bear will come and maul us, or a mad killer who waits for children, or more likely we will starve. And there is still the witch to consider.\n\u201cI hate them both,\u201d you say.\n\u201cMe too,\u201d I say, but really I do not feel hate so much as a terrible, terrible sickness. Sometimes I wish I could be as angry as you. It seems to protect you like a shield the badness bounces off of. \u201cWhat do you think will happen to us?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cThey think we\u2019ll die, but we won\u2019t.\u201d\nYes, I think. We won\u2019t. Somehow the fact that we have said it makes me feel a sense of relief, as if, now, admitting what we are up against, we have a chance.\nWe do things in the dark. It isn\u2019t exactly sex, but your press your body against me so there is no room between our bodies and you put your hands between my legs, but you don\u2019t move them. You just press against me, and it soothes me.\nI whisper, \u201cWill you always be here?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d you say.\nEven though we are miserable, I am less miserable with you.\nTonight I dream only of the bread that I put on the path, and each scrap of dry bread is rising again like yeasty dough and baking itself into a full, warm loaf of bread. We scoop them all up and put them in our baskets. Like the bellies of babies, we can\u2019t resist smelling each one.\nIf you weren\u2019t my stepbrother, I would want to marry you.\nI think that somewhere the witch is waiting for us. She is mixing potions in her woodland hut. Sometimes she is the creature seen by small children when they think about nasty things. She is what we shouldn\u2019t be doing and she is waiting for us in the forest. I\u2019ve heard she eats small children and then grinds their bones up into powder to put on her cereal. She loves the chunky legs of toddlers with whipped, mashed potatoes and dill on the side. Maybe she sees us now.\nIn the morning, we anticipate seeing the witch, but instead we find a house that is empty. The house is made of candy and we start eating it, our hands full of sticky chocolate siding with raspberries, marshmallow cobblestones, peanut butter steps and peppermint windowpanes. Trying for a moment of forethought, I say, \u201cShould we be eating someone else\u2019s house?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s candy\u201d you say \u2014always the one with the right answer. \u201cIt\u2019s meant to be eaten.\u201d Candy does seem by its definition intent on being eaten, but in this case it is also a building material. In any case, physical hunger and our childish natures win out.\nLater the witch comes home and is angry with us. \u201cThis is a gross destruction of private property.\u201d She says. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to pay with your lives.\u201d\nWe identify her as a witch because she is old and ugly. She is not someone who we will burn at the stake. We will not torture her to find out her pact with Satan. That has been done in the past. I know about that from my English teacher, who seems to love talking about what she calls the The Burning Times. She says the witch is a scapegoat for men\u2019s fear of women.\nBut this is a real witch and there is real reason for fear.\nAfter the first night, I realize that the witch does not want to kill me. She only wants to kill you.\nShe tells me that men are the real problem and that she will groom me to be a witch like her. I pretend that I have turned on you and am in love with the witch. Her name is Evelyn. All of the time I am plotting how to kill Evelyn.\nI mend her nightgowns for her. I clean the house for her. I wash her underwear, which have the foul smell of old folk\u2019s urine. She puts you in a cage where you are supposed to grow fat like a lamb. She has the key to your cage in a locket around her neck; she\u2019s so old-fashioned. I can\u2019t figure out how to get it. I wish that I could Google it \u2014 escape, witch, forest \u2014 but she doesn\u2019t even have the Internet.\nShe preens over me and tells me how pretty I am. She combs my hair and I feel her old, scaly fingers running over my scalp and touching the skin on my neck and shoulders. It makes me shudder. I don\u2019t know if she wants to eat me or make love with me. It all feels the same.\nMy job is to fatten you up. I cook meals for you and feed them to you, but when she leaves you make yourself throw-up into a yellow Tupperware container and I take it outside. I dig holes in the yard and bury your vomit. I uncover many bones. Some of them look human.\nOne day when she returns from one of her trips, she decides that it\u2019s time to eat you. She is preparing the oven to put you in it. What will I do if she kills you? I need to act now. I need to be brave.\nI tell her that the flue in the oven is stuck and that I can\u2019t get the heat that I need to bake you. She puts her head into the oven to see and I push her from behind. She struggles with me, but I am stronger.\nShe turns towards me and she looks more vulnerable than expected. More like an old woman than a witch, with her body bent over and her hair turned gray and a beet stain on the front of her dress. I push nonetheless. I push and think of you. She fights back, but she is old and I am young and strong.\nOf course, as you\u2019ve been told, the smell of human flesh burning is horrible. I did what I had to do. She might have been misunderstood. Perhaps I should have tried harder to love her so she would change inside.\nBut you are saved and we push our children\u2019s bodies together. We gorge ourselves on the house and I run my hands through your sticky, lollypop hair. You put your candied lips against mine. You put your gummy worm tongue in my mouth. Our parents have killed us; the witch is dead, what\u2019s there to lose? Your hands running up my dress. I touch you and lick your eyelids. We have sex like we think the men and women do.\nAfter that day we see that we can\u2019t go back home and we can\u2019t be together. It would be too complicated and we just want to forget everything that happened. I\u2019m taken away by child protective services and adopted by a gay couple. We have a \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy. They don\u2019t ask me about my childhood and I don\u2019t ask them if they\u2019re really sure they\u2019ll stay together forever and ever. We never eat Wonder Bread and I finally got to taste truffle oil.\nAnd you? I don\u2019t know where you go. We learned from our childhood that there is no looking back, the trail is already gone. I heard you lied about your age and got a job at the bread factory. Sometimes when I am eating a piece of bread, I imagine that you were the one who baked it, sealed it, or, at the very least, loaded the pallets onto the truck.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Will the marriage survive?\n\u201cYou need to work on your Double Buffalo,\u201d Colombia said to the skewbald horse who was packing up his hat full of tips after a day of busking on 22nd Street.\n\u201cBetween you and me,\u201d Colombia tapped his nose and looked up and down the street to check no one was looking, \u201cI think you\u2019d be better off in the rodeo \u2014 it\u2019s a bit more, you know, what people expect.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what people expect of a horse with a rider \u2014 I\u2019m in charge of my own fate.\u201d He then performed a move which involved a hop, a leap, a pirouette on his hind legs before landing with his right foreleg crossed over his left. He flicked his head, tossed his long forelock over his right eye in the manner of a sexy film star and then just to cherry the cake, he winked.\nColombia tossed several coins into his hat and imagined what Esm\u00e9 would say when he got home and told her about the tap-dancing horse.\nEsm\u00e9 was asleep on the sofa and the TV was on mute.\nIn the kitchen Colombia poured two cups of coffee, and placed them on a lacquered tray. He carried the steaming drinks into the living room.\nEsm\u00e9 awoke and stretched her arms languorously. \u201cHow was your day, hon?\u201d\n\u201cFine. And you\u2019ll never guess what I saw on my way home.\u201d\n\u201cA tap-dancing horse.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you know?\u201d\n\u201cI saw him too, and I have invited him to dine this evening.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do horses eat?\u201d\n\u201cOats, barley, crudit\u00e9s and deviled eggs, I believe.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem very knowledgeable on equine matters.\u201d\n\u201cUncle Red had a ranch in Wyoming. I spent my summers there when I was knee-high.\u201d\nColombia planted a kiss on her forehead. She put her soft, milky-white arms around him.\n\u201cYou are a woman of so many talents and surprises. And what time is Mr. Whateverhisnameis coming? And how will he get up the stairs?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a tap-dancing horse will be put off by a few flights of stairs in an apartment building.\u201d\nJust then Colombia heard the electronic suck and exhalation of the lift doors opening and closing. The clip clop of hooves followed by what he imagined to be an impatient hoof against the wooden door.\nEsm\u00e9 quickly put on her teal slippers, smoothed back her hair and opened the door.\n\u201cAh, Mr., Mr. \u2014 we have been expecting you. Welcome to our home.\u201d\nThe horse snorted a welcome and Colombia wiped away a spray of mucus from his forehead.\n\u201cMy name is Darcy,\u201d the horse said out of the side of his mouth, in a manner not unlike that of the famous Mr. Ed.\n\u201cCan I get you something Mr. Darcy?\u201d Colombia offered.\n\u201cWould you have any cider? I am partial to sparkling drinks of any kind. My veterinarian strongly disapproves \u2014 colic dangers \u2014 but till now, bite on wood, I\u2019ve had no problems.\u201d\nEsm\u00e9 and Colombia exchanged worried glances.\nAt that moment Mr. Darcy let out a rip-roaring fart and the air in the apartment turned fetid. \u201cDo excuse my manners. It is a while since I have dined amongst friends.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder that he has any, if this is how he behaves,\u201d Colombia whispered to Esm\u00e9 as they retreated to the kitchen.\n\u201cDo we have any cider?\u201d Colombia opened a few cupboard doors.\nEsm\u00e9 was on all fours looking in the cupboard under the worktop where they kept unwanted beverages.\n\u201cAh, here we are, Babycham. Surely Mr. Darcy will like that.\u201d Esm\u00e9 poured the bubbly drink into a champagne flute.\n\u201cHe can\u2019t drink out of that! He\u2019s a horse for goodness sake. Put it in a saucer so he can lap it up.\u201d\n\u201cHorses don\u2019t lap.\u201d\n\u201cWell, suck then.\u201d\nEsm\u00e9 took a china saucer from the tea set that was a wedding gift from her mother-in-law and poured the Babycham into that.\n\u201cMmmmm. Quite delicious,\u201d Mr. Darcy said as he licked his lips after sucking up the Babycham in one gulp.\nEsm\u00e9 and Colombia laid the oblong table. The horse stood at the long side and after drinking several saucers of Babycham, appeared to doze off.\nIn the kitchen, Esm\u00e9 arranged deviled eggs on an oval platter.\n\u201cMy dear, next time you have the urge to invite a street performer to our home, could you possibly suppress it.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Esm\u00e9 picked up the oval platter. \u201cHe has almost been the perfect gentleman until now.\u201d\nColombia watched his wife put the dish on the table. Then she stroked Mr. Darcy\u2019s neck and laid her cheek against his soft coat. \u201cOh, I do love the smell of horses. It takes me right back to Uncle Red\u2019s ranch.\u201d\nThe horse opened his eyes briefly.\nColombia and Esm\u00e9 sat opposite each other at the short ends of the oblong table.\n\u201cWhere did you learn to tap-dance?\u201d Colombia asked.\n\u201cOh, a companion from my carriage-horse days taught me. She had worked in a circus. We were let loose on the East Side when our owner couldn\u2019t afford to feed us any more. Then we had to fend for ourselves. There was an unfortunate incident with a trap-door and I lost little Nimblelegs.\u201d Mr Darcy looked wistfully out the window.\n\u201cAnd you make a good living from tap-dancing?\u201d Colombia hoped to lighten the mood.\n\u201cThe public are very generous. Today I received a $100 bill in my hat!\u201d\nColombia thought of his meagre earnings as a bank clerk. Perhaps he should pick up tap-dancing again. He\u2019d had some lessons as a child.\n\u201cHave you thought of going on the television?\u201d Esm\u00e9 offered the horse some crudit\u00e9s.\n\u201cLike that vulgar chap, the talking horse?\u201d\n\u201cMr. Ed?\u201d\n\u201cYes, him. It\u2019s all trickery you know. The horse is as dull as ditch water. He hasn\u2019t the slightest grasp of grammar and syntax. A mere charlatan. Whereas I am the real deal.\u201d He sipped another saucer of Babycham.\nColombia worried that a tipsy horse might be hard to get rid of. He didn\u2019t want him crashing on their apartment floor. Like an angel coming to his rescue, the wall clock chimed ten times.\n\u201cLook at the time,\u201d Mr. Darcy said. \u201cI have to secure my place under the bridge by 10:30 at the latest.\u201d\n\u201cYou make all this money and you live under a bridge?\u201d Esm\u00e9 bit into a carrot.\n\u201cI\u2019m ashamed to say I have debts. I am slowly buying back my lost wealth from the pawn shop. When I was a racehorse I earned big bucks but then, like so many, I was drawn to gambling and lost the lot. And I have always had, ahem, an eye for a well-turned fetlock.\u201d\nColombia wondered what Mr. Darcy\u2019s right eye was doing to make Esm\u00e9 blush like that. At the table he could only see the horse\u2019s left eye. Damned inconsiderate to have an eye either side of his head and not both at the front like most people.\nColombia stood up and stacked the plates. He took them to the kitchen and washed them up, hoping that Mr. Darcy would be saying his goodbyes soon.\nA warm fragrant breath in Colombia\u2019s neck aroused him somewhat. He turned round quickly and there stood Esm\u00e9. She had packed her crocodile suitcase.\n\u201cI am going away for a few days. Mr. Darcy has promised to show me his old racetrack out west and I thought a few days sightseeing would be fun. The circus is heading that way tomorrow and Mr Darcy says I can tag along.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to sleep under a bridge and then join the circus. Have you quite lost your mind?\u201d\nColombia dropped a saucer which smashed into little pieces on the floor.\n\u201cNow look what you made me do. Mother\u2019s fine crockery in shards.\u201d\n\u201cI really don\u2019t care about all those bourgeois things anymore.\u201d Esm\u00e9 said as she pulled on the ocelot coat which had cost Colombia several wage packages to buy last Christmas.\nMr. Darcy was waiting in the dining room, his one hind leg in a resting position. Esm\u00e9 took a dining chair and used it as a mounting block to get on Mr Darcy\u2019s back. He must have dozed off again because he started forward a little as his back accepted her sylphlike form.\n\u201cOpen the door for us, would you?\u201d Esm\u00e9 ordered Colombia, as if he were a servant.\nEyes saucering in the manner of someone having an unexpected rectal examination, Colombia opened the door and watched the love of his life leave him. \u201cI\u2019ll think twice about putting money into a hat the next time I see a performing horse on 22nd Street!\u201d Colombia shook his head as he walked to the kitchen.\nGold-digger and feckless floozy all rolled into one; Mother\u2019s I-told-you-so words looped in Colombia\u2019s head.\nHe stood at the window until horse and rider disappeared into a side street. Esm\u00e9 didn\u2019t even turn to wave.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

From her brush bloomed brows. Her nose, like clay, sculpted. From the mirror, she smiled. The ritual was complete. My grandmother had a face.\n\u201cCan I try?\u201d I had asked.\nBut my grandmother had simply laughed. \u201cYou are too young!\u201d\nBut when my grandmother left, I climbed her vanity. I grabbed one of her tools. I attempted to create a different face, but my image became distorted in the mirror. Color was smeared. My grandmother returned and shouted.\nI was in trouble.\nShe fixed my face with water.\nI was restored.\nThis is a memory of when I had a face. I don\u2019t remember losing it. It is not like a pencil, rolling off of a desk. It is not like keys, temporarily misplaced.\nI\u2019ve tried retracing my steps, but it has been too long since my face disappeared. I will never find it again.\nSo, like all of us, I must put on my face every morning. I paint the lips, I sculpt the nose, I craft the eyes.\nThen, I see me behind the mirror and I know I have a face. I can go on to the streets without blindly stumbling. I would not want to be faceless on the street. I want to be seen.\nLet me be seen.\nThe faceless ones are the invisible ones. We see them, obviously, but they aren\u2019t discernible. They are blank canvases of nothingness. They are indistinguishable. They are ugly in their sameness.\nThis is what I thought because this is what I was taught.\nIt wasn\u2019t until I met her that she showed me. She did not have a face, the woman I love. But I know her. In a crowd of a billion and one, I see her. She is, to me, the most recognizable human being on the planet. She has marked me with her love and I have marked her in return. We do not need faces to see one another.\nShe introduces me to others who are faceless. There are so many.\nI did not know.\nI admit my ignorance to her, afraid that she will shun me. But she understands. She forgives.\nShe tells me that all is beautiful. The faces are lovely and so are the faceless. She tells me that there is no right or wrong. She tells me that the standard is only what is accepted by the many. She tells me that it is okay to be accepted by the few.\nI go forward into streets without a face, defiant. I will join the revolution. A martyr of this cause.\nBut she tells me that this is not a reason to be faceless. She tells me that facelessness is a choice, just as it is to be faced. It is not a decision to be made lightly.\nI tell her that I want to be like her; she tells me that admiration and love are not the same thing.\n\u201cYour facelessness must be your own,\u201d she says.\n\u201cBut if we\u2019re all the same, why can\u2019t I be yours?\u201d\nShe lets me go. She tells me to be me.\nI rebel against that faceless woman. I wake up. I paint the lips, I sculpt the nose, I craft the eyes: I am seen. They see me. They look at me.\nLook at me.\nThey look at me with empty, hollow shells of eyes, created by their own hands.\nTheir looks are not what I see. They are not what I feel. I am afraid, on the street. They see me, but they do not see me.\nI run into the rain and let the water return me to me. My face is melted into puddles.\nI call her in a phone booth on the corner. She does not answer.\nI refuse to leave my home. My grandmother never left the house without her face. I do not have the strength to put on my face. Nor do I have the strength to be faceless. I am at an impasse with myself. There is no way forward.\nWhat sort of creature am I? I pity me.\nI call her again. She does not reply.\nI call her on the landline, at the bar where she works. She is forced to answer.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\nShe hangs up.\nI walk into the street and become absorbed in the sea of flesh: Some of the faces are molded, some are not. I want to be part of them. I want to be apart from them. This contradiction makes no sense.\nI don\u2019t know what I want. I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know who to be or not be. I have no sculpted eyes, but I see my reflection in a passing storefront. I see myself, younger. The face of my childhood. I see my grandmother\u2019s face. I see her grandmother\u2019s face.\nI have no face. I move between city streets, unseen. Invisible. Nameless, faceless.\nBut I am here.\nI am here.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

And not far away, the sound of the ocean.\nI had been traveling. Far from my father\u2019s funeral, far from myself. I was seeking \u2014something to give me solace or to end my misery.\nSo the river presented itself. And who knows how long I would have stood at its edge if she hadn\u2019t appeared.\n\u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d she had asked. Oh, how young she was, and how delicate. Pale, translucent skin shimmering in the light. Her feet caught in the mud, startling and white. Her eyes dark as the sea.\n\u201cMy father died,\u201d I said, \u201cand there is nothing left for me in this world.\u201d\n\u201cThat can\u2019t be true,\u201d she said. \u201cLook at the buds on the trees, the birds in the sky, feel the breath in your chest. There is so much left for you to live.\u201d\n\u201cI have no home,\u201d I heard myself say, \u201cno land, no family. Everything I had is gone.\u201d\n\u201cThen you will start a new life,\u201d she said and extended her hand. It was a moment before I took it, a moment light from the water played upon her hair, the light all around us, and I could see a new and bright future.\nI took her hand.\nWe were married in a church with a pastor. He spoke to us in Latin and I said the words I could remember. I was raised Catholic if nothing else.\nThe night we were married she told me one thing.\n\u201cYou cannot ask about me on a Thursday,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t do it. If you are happy at all, even a little bit. Do not do it.\u201d\n\u201cMy dearest, love,\u201d I said, \u201cmy one and only, my wife, I will not ask about you on a Thursday.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said and attacked me with kisses.\nWe built our house from cedar trees and from driftwood brought up by the sea, so that the whole house smelled like a traveling trunk. We paved our floor with river-smoothed stone and our windowsills with pebbles as brilliant as glass. The seagulls sang to us as we built.\nShe was strong for all that she was delicate and she was smart for all that she was pale. And I was strong and smart though a man. And together we were happy.\nWe made love on Mondays and Tuesdays and Wednesdays and Fridays.\nBut never on a Thursday.\nWe talked about Proust and Gogol and about God and truth.\nBut never on a Thursday.\nWe swam in the river and the ocean and the meeting point of the two, with the salt in our mouths and our mouths on each other.\nBut never on a Thursday.\nWe cooked pasta in the kitchen and spilled it in the living room. We watched marathons of Audrey Hepburn movies and we danced to the Rolling Stones.\nBut never never never on a Thursday.\nYears passed and I became a fisherman and she became a dancer and an artist and a sculptor. And we had no money and we were happy. And our first child was due to be born in November.\n\u201cWill it be a boy?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cHow should I know,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWill it be a girl?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cI could care less,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWill you love it?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cMore than anything,\u201d she said.\nAnd so we were still very happy.\nThe day of the birth approached. And the doctor gave us a date.\n\u201cIs that a Thursday?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cWhy, yes it is,\u201d the doctor said.\n\u201cOh,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIs that a problem?\u201d the doctor asked.\n\u201cJust a complication,\u201d she said.\nI said nothing, for I knew that I must not ask about her on a Thursday.\nThat Thursday drew near, and as usual, a few minutes before midnight, I moved from the bedroom to the living room and locked the door behind me. All that day I waited. Hoping to hear something, screams, crying, anything, but there was only silence behind the locked door. As there always was. Silence except for the distant roar of the sea and the plaintive calls of the gulls.\nThat was the longest day of my life. I spent the time knotting, knotting, knotting a new fishing net. But when at last the clock struck midnight once more and the bedroom door unlocked, I rushed in to see her holding a tiny seashell of a child, pale and silent as moonlight \u2026\nThere were years that passed like rain on the rooftop, waves against the shore, the smell of salt in everything. In my skin and in hers and in our children. They were small, all three of them, but perfect and beautiful and ours. They collected shells and pressed each one to my ear so I could hear the ocean again and again. They wove houses out of seaweed. They swam across and across and across the river.\nBut never on a Thursday.\nHad I hoped that whatever illness, whatever curse had befallen her, had I hoped that it might pass them by? Had I dreamt that my blood, mixed with hers, our DNA woven together, might have made a stronger net, to pull them from whatever depths?\nI had.\nBut it was not to be.\nFourteen years since we met, fourteen years without Thursdays, fourteen years of joy, sorrow, anger, joy.\nAnd it happened on a Wednesday. I was sitting in my boat, casting out my nets, when I caught hold of something heavy. Enormously heavy, unbelievably so. I hauled with all my strength, I wrestled, and I pulled into the boat the largest fish I had ever seen.\nIt was covered in scales so light and pale, they shone like silver in the high morning sun.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d the fish said, \u201cplease do not kill me. If you return me to the water, I will give you that which you most desire.\u201d\n\u201cWhat could you possibly have to offer,\u201d I laughed, imagining already the gifts I could buy for my children, the necklace I could place around my wife\u2019s neck, the fortune I would gain from this fish\u2019s flesh.\n\u201cI know what your wife does on a Thursday,\u201d the fish said. He was gasping for air at this point, his scales already fading. \u201cIf you throw me back I will tell you.\u201d\n\u201cHow could you possibly know?\u201d I asked. \u201cHow do I know you\u2019re not lying?\u201d\n\u201cWould I lie?\u201d the fish gasped. \u201cWould I lie?\u201d His tail flapped sadly against the planks.\n\u201cTell me!\u201d I yelled. But too late, the fish had expired. So I rowed home, ready to sell it to the fish market for a stack of bills.\nBy the time I had reached shore the fish had rotted. I dumped its useless carcass back into the sea.\nThat night it was a Wednesday night and the fish\u2019s words echoed in my ears.\n\u201cI know what your wife does on a Thursday,\u201d the fish had said. \u201cI know what your wife does.\u201d\nAs usual, I got out of bed shortly before midnight, leaving my wife and our three children all nestled in our bed. I left the four of them lying there, abandoning their warmth for the cold comfort of the couch.\nAlone, I tossed and I turned, the moonlight dropping through the window, casting lines of shadow and light, shadow and light. Solid and fading.\n\u201cWould I lie?\u201d the fish asked. \u201cWould I lie?\u201d\nThe seagulls cried in the dark.\nI stood. My feet hit the floor with a shock that should have awakened me. But it did not. I walked, my heart jittering, my nerves jangling, and I stood before the locked door. Light shone through the keyhole.\nAnd \u2026\nI knelt down and pressed my eye to the hole \u2026\nI met her where the river meets the land, where the ocean meets the river. I met her where the earth melds with the water.\nI lost her on a Thursday. Her and our beautiful children, delicate and pure as shells on the floor of the ocean. I lost them, fourteen years ago, and I will not find them, not ever again.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Epidemiologists said that we could limit the spread by using facial recognition to identify everyone that an infected patient had been in contact with. Some cities used it to make sure that people were keeping quarantine. And once all those cameras and checkpoints were in place, they kept finding new ways to use them.\nBy the time I started school, it all seemed normal.\nOur elementary school was a three-story building that took up an entire city block. On Fridays after school we would crowd into Happy Deli Grocery and buy whatever snacks we could afford with the coins in our pockets. My friend Aisha and I always tried to sneak a candy bar whenever Mr. Halim turned his back to grab something from behind the counter. We would walk home, giddy, our bellies full of purloined sugar. The empty weekend ahead seemed full of possibility.\nAs a child, I was an accomplished liar. I never meant any harm, it\u2019s just that the truth was always less interesting than whatever was going on in my own head. Most of the time, I got away with it. People rarely noticed me, so they never suspected a thing. I suppose my face was unremarkable. It helped that I was a year younger and a head shorter than most of my classmates.\nAisha wasn\u2019t so lucky.

The owner had turned in the footage and the photo on Aisha\u2019s student ID matched the face of a shoplifter caught on film.\nShe wasn\u2019t the only one in trouble. A lot of our friends had their faces ID\u2019d. They all had to work off their debt, coming in on the weekends to unpack boxes and clean out the storage room in the back. Mr. Halim kept a close eye on them after that, so it became my job to lift the candy while Aisha kept him distracted.\nIt never occurred to me to wonder: Why was I the only one who didn\u2019t get caught?\n*\nIt was a dream of my mother\u2019s that I would be the first in our family to go to college in America. I wasn\u2019t the best student, but I didn\u2019t want to disappoint her, so I downloaded an SAT prep app and studied on the weekends. On the day of the exam, I left the house early to take the train uptown.\nThe test was proctored in a red-brick private school that smelled of Lysol and other people\u2019s ambition. From the moment I walked through its archways, I felt small and out of place, my armpits damp underneath my sweater.\nThe stairwell was full of people. I wondered if anyone felt as nervous as I did. Most of them just looked bored, staring down at their phones. A white girl with curly blonde hair waved and gestured for me to come over. She smiled awkwardly as I got closer. \u201cSorry,\u201d she mumbled. \u201cI thought you were somebody else.\u201d\nOutside of the testing room was a station that scanned each student\u2019s face. \u201cWhy are we doing this?\u201d I heard someone ask.\n\u201cToo many cheaters,\u201d explained the sullen woman behind the computer. \u201cWe need to make sure that the person who\u2019s registered is the one that\u2019s actually taking the test.\u201d\nShe turned to me. \u201cLike you, you could pay some kid in India $10,000 and they\u2019d take the SAT for you.\u201d My family isn\u2019t even from India, I thought. But I didn\u2019t say anything.\nWhen it was my turn to step in front of the camera, I could see my own pixelated face looking back at me on the screen. I blinked at the dark shadows underneath my eyes, my limp ponytail.\nI stood there for what felt like minutes. \u201cIs it working? How long is it supposed to take?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t match any of the photos on the attendance list. I can\u2019t let you in if you\u2019re not registered,\u201d the woman replied.\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely registered. Look, I have the confirmation email right here.\u201d I thrust my phone in front of her face. \u201cCan\u2019t I just show you my driver\u2019s license? Or my student ID?\u201d\n\u201cFace ID only. Contact the College Board if you have questions.\u201d I looked at her blankly, unsure what to do.\nShe jerked her head towards the door. \u201cCome on, you\u2019re holding up the line.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to say, so I just walked away, down the marble staircase and through the cast iron gate.\nSure, there had been other times when I realized some scanner couldn\u2019t read my face. Like it would always say << No Face Detected >> whenever I tried to use one of those camera filters that makes it look like you have puppy ears or you\u2019re wearing a flower crown. But that was just a party trick I\u2019d show off to strangers, an attempt to make myself seem interesting and mysterious.\nIf I had known how things would turn out, would I have reacted differently? I like to imagine I would have tried harder to stand up for myself. But at first, not being recognized was just an inconvenience. By the time it became something more, it was too late.\n*\nEventually they came up with a name for people like me \u2014 illegible \u2014 and gave us one year to report to the local police station.\nOn the night that we first heard the news, my family came together to discuss my options. Even my sister got involved. With their heads bent over the kitchen table, they looked like a Renaissance painting.\nThe police said they only wanted to collect more data so they could improve the algorithm. But the rumors said different. People whispered that illegibles were being forced to undergo a procedure, some kind of surgery that would reconstruct our faces into something that was machine-readable.\nIt was easier, I guess, than getting the algorithm to work 100 percent of the time.\n\u201cIt works for 98.8 percent of people,\u201d my father said. \u201cSo, if you think about it, you\u2019re actually the one percent.\u201d\nIn his 20s, my father had been an organizer for Occupy Wall Street. He grew a beard and squatted for months in Zuccotti Park. These days, he belted his pants and tucked in his polo shirt before going to work. He knew, better than most, that ideological purity was a luxury that only the truly wealthy could afford.\nDad was a pragmatist. For him, the answer was simple: \u201cIt\u2019ll be easier for everyone if you just get the surgery.\u201d\nMy mother sucked her teeth in disapproval. She was certain that plastic surgery was haram. She prayed for a miracle instead. Over the next few months, I often caught her sitting alone in her bedroom or the kitchen, muttering duas under her breath.\nMy sister knew someone who knew someone who\u2019d brought home a whole suitcase full of Fair & Lovely skin cream from their last trip to Jakarta. The lotion contained a bleaching ingredient that was illegal here in the States. If my skin were lighter, she figured, maybe cameras would be able to detect me better. She had always put a lot of stock in appearances.\nNo two faces are exactly alike, but for the most part they\u2019re consistent. I never did figure out what set mine apart. Unable to sleep at night, I would gaze upon my sister\u2019s face. Her eyelids, her nostrils, the corners of her mouth. All so similar to my own.\nWhat was it that she had that I did not?\n*\nI remember the moment when things really started to go wrong. I had been working for three months at a Zara in Midtown. It was a good job. The customers were mostly tourists, plus I got a 15 percent employee discount.\nIt was a busy Saturday when my manager pulled me aside and told me they were going to have to let me go. Corporate was using facial recognition to make sure that employees were coming in on time. According to the system, I wasn\u2019t showing up for any of my shifts.\n\u201cWhat are you even talking about?! We work the same days. You know I\u2019ve been here!\u201d\nWithout meaning to, I had started to shout. I could see a customer looking over her shoulder in surprise. I had never raised my voice at work before, but I simply couldn\u2019t believe it: It was the first time I felt certain, beyond a doubt, that some injustice had been done. And I wasn\u2019t seventeen anymore; I\u2019d stopped biting my tongue just so that other people would feel more comfortable.\nThe thing is, my manager agreed with me, it must be some glitch in the system. But there was nothing she could do. There were plenty of people willing to work for $12 an hour and it wasn\u2019t worth her time to stand up for me.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be alright,\u201d she assured me. Her eyes were already looking past me, assessing the coil of people lining up to pay at the cash registers. None of this was her fault. It wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault, really. That was the whole problem.\nI needed a job, and it only got harder to find one.\n\u201cWe use face ID for payroll,\u201d said the manager at the department store at the mall.\n\u201cRegister and start making money today! Hold your phone in front of your face to begin,\u201d instructed a food delivery app.\nI found a wine bar willing to pay me under the table, all cash, but I stopped going after the owner cornered me in the walk-in refrigerator and grabbed the meat of my thigh, called me a bitch when I pushed him away.\nEventually I moved back in with my parents. The apartment I grew up in felt cramped with three adults in it.\nI knew they were worried about me. They would speak in whispers when they thought I wasn\u2019t listening, then fall silent when I walked in the room. Unemployed and listless, I spent a lot of time alone with my thoughts.\nI avoided mirrors.\nThere were stretches where I wouldn\u2019t leave bed for days at a time. I lost track of what month we were in. Once in a while, I met up with a friend, but I\u2019d quickly run out of things to say. I found myself resenting the quiet ease of their lives. I even resented their problems, their overbearing bosses or petty squabbles with their coworkers.\nBy then, I had been out of work for more than a year. I couldn\u2019t get unemployment either. You needed to register your face for that.\nMy sister pushed me to get the facial reconstruction surgery. She couldn\u2019t understand why I was being so stubborn.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a simple procedure,\u201d she reasoned.\n\u201cWhat do you know about surgery? You cried when you got your wisdom teeth out.\u201d\n\u201cI was 17! You know what, it doesn\u2019t matter. This is different. You\u2019ll be under anesthesia. They\u2019re professionals, they know how to minimize the pain.\u201d\n\u201cThey literally crack open your cheekbones and rearrange your face,\u201d I seethed.\n\u201cCalm down, I\u2019m only trying to help. Don\u2019t you just want to be normal?\u201d\nNormal. That was always the goal. When we were in high school, my sister would take the bus to the thrift stores in the good part of town. She memorized the schedules (Thursday was when Goodwill put out new stock) and made friends with the staff (Rigoberto at Salvation Army promised to hold aside any designer jeans in her size). She\u2019d come home with her treasures and make them look new, scrubbing out stains with a toothbrush, replacing buttons and stitching ripped hems. All this just so she could look the same as everyone else.\nI never understood the urge to be normal. I wanted something more than that: to be myself.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my face. It\u2019s mine and I\u2019m keeping it.\u201d\nA heavy silence sat between us. For several moments, neither of us spoke.\n\u201cDid you know, I have the same nose as grandma? It skipped a generation. I\u2019m the last person alive with this nose.\u201d\n\u201cThey might not even change your nose! You won\u2019t know unless you go for a consultation.\u201d\n\u201cBut why am I the one that has to change?\u201d My voice cracked down the middle. \u201cWhy are you angry at me when \u2013\u2013 when it\u2019s this system that\u2019s fucked up!\u201d\n\u201cBecause you think you\u2019re being principled and brave when what you really are is selfish! It\u2019s like you don\u2019t even care what it\u2019s doing to dad, having to see you wallow away like this.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the thing about siblings. They know how to hit where it hurts the most. I left the room, and when she called to apologize, I didn\u2019t pick up.\nIt was around this time that my iPhone stopped working. I couldn\u2019t even replace it since all of the newer phone models required a face ID to unlock. My mom gave me one of those old indestructible Nokia phones but, really, who even sent texts anymore? Gradually, I stopped hearing from friends. It was just too hard to reach me.\n*\nWhen my father died, I hadn\u2019t spoken to my sister for more than a year, not since she moved to the suburbs. She invited everyone we knew to come over for the tahlilan after dad\u2019s burial. It was the first and only time I visited her in that large house with its dark green shutters.\nWhat kind of person needs space for three cars, I wondered, as my mother and I walked up the long driveway. I knocked on the door. When no one came to answer, I knocked again. I could see my sister through the front window.\nShe was whispering in her husband\u2019s ear, a small, content smile tucked in the corner of her mouth. They seemed happy.\nEventually she looked up and our eyes met through the clear windowpane. She rushed outside and wrapped her arms around me. We clung together so tightly that for a moment it felt like we were sisters again.\n\u201cCome in, come in,\u201d she said, impatient. She motioned for me to take off my shoes and place them at the end of the neat row by the door. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear you knock. The doorbell usually just announces when someone is here, but, well, I guess it didn\u2019t see you\u2026You should have let mom stand in front.\u201d\n\u201cYou should\u2019ve been paying more attention!\u201d I snapped back, already annoyed.\nShe thinned her lips and shook her head in disapproval. Her eyes darted to where my mother was kneeling behind me to unlace her boots. \u201cSorry,\u201d I muttered. I let my sister guide me over to where her husband was standing.\nHer husband was, predictably, white and he had a harmless, affable look about him. He had gone to grad school \u201cin Connecticut,\u201d which was his way of saying Yale. It seemed like it wouldn\u2019t be long before I had nieces and nephews.\nSeeing her in the new house confirmed that my sister had grown up and left me behind. My mother was getting older, too. It was getting harder for her to manage the stairs in our apartment. Without dad\u2019s pension, neither of us knew how we would pay the rent.\nMy sister offered her their guest room.\n\u201cStay as long as you need,\u201d she said.\nNeither of them mentioned it, but I understood that the invitation did not include me. Everything in my sister\u2019s life was perfectly curated and I was this odd, inexplicable thing. Sometimes, I suspected that she resented me. I was too close a reminder of how narrowly she had escaped the working class. I knew she loved me, in her own way, but I didn\u2019t want to beg her to take me in.\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure you can stay with a friend until you find your own place?\u201d my mother asked, anxiously, for the third time.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d I lied. I had no intention of asking my sister (or anyone else) for a favor, but my mother didn\u2019t need to know that. I reassured them both, repeatedly, that everything was going to be fine until, eventually, even I started to believe it was true.\nThat night I got on the train and went back to the city, alone.\n*\nOn our block there was a building scheduled for demolition. They were going to tear it down and put up a tower of luxury condos in its place. On the ground floor was an empty storefront. Its front door had been boarded over, but whoever had nailed down the plywood hadn\u2019t done a very good job. I crawled in easily. It seemed as good of a place to live as any. A nest of blankets and a few crushed Miller Lite cans in the corner told me I wasn\u2019t the first to come here, but I never actually saw anyone else inside.\nThe thing about being illegible was that it robbed you of choices. Any type of aid came with conditions. An abandoned building wasn\u2019t much of a choice, but it was one that I made freely.\nThere were shelters, of course, places where you could get a bed for the night. But I didn\u2019t want my every move to be monitored, or worse, to be sent away with the rest of the illegibles.\nI was better off on my own.\nIt was kind of eerie to sleep in an empty husk of a building, but it amused me to pretend I was a ghost haunting the place. My sense of humor had grown very dark. When my sister and I were younger, our mother would tell us stories of kuntilanak, vengeful female spirits with a grudge against a former lover. I couldn\u2019t help but admire that kind of single-minded sense of purpose.\nI was far too tired to even think about plotting revenge on anyone.\nAt least it was easy enough for me to get food, even without any money. No one worked the counters at the grocery stores anymore. There were cameras and weight sensors in each shopping cart that could figure out what you were buying. Your face was linked to your bank account, so you were automatically charged at the exit.\nI would just walk in, take what I wanted and walk out. The trick was acting like you suddenly remembered something you forgot at home. I would leave through the front door in a hurry, abandoning my cart in the aisle, so I didn\u2019t flag any of the algorithms that detected suspicious behavior on CCTV.\nI tried to do it with a certain degree of irony. That way it was like I was playing a role, which felt better than living my actual life.\nWith my mother gone from the city, I hardly saw anyone. Who do we become after there is no one left to recognize us, to see us as we see ourselves?\n*\nIt was late October when a man followed me home from the grocery store. A stranger. He tailed me for six blocks while I decided whether to confront him or run away.\nHe caught up to me at a busy intersection, where we both waited to cross.\n\u201cI saw what you did back there,\u201d he said.\n\u201cExcuse me? Do I know you?\u201d\nHe continued speaking as if I hadn\u2019t asked a question. \u201cBack there, in the store.\u201d He pointed to my bag of groceries. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t pay for those.\u201d\nShit. Was he some kind of security guard? I shrugged and tried to look nonchalant.\n\u201cThe store will just charge my account.\u201d\n\u201cThey would. If their cameras could see you. But we both know they can\u2019t.\u201d\nThe light at the crosswalk turned green and I hurried to the other side of the street. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, but I actually have somewhere to be.\u201d\nHis footsteps grew longer as he rushed to catch up to me. \u201cWait! Hey, I\u2019m sorry, I should have found a better way to introduce myself. It\u2019s just, we\u2019ve been looking for someone like you for a long time. If you just wait a minute, let me explain. I promise I\u2019m not a creep.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re doing a very good impression of one.\u201d\n\u201cI get it, you don\u2019t want to talk to me. But \u2014\u201d his voice lowered. \u201cHave you heard of the Defaced?\u201d\nI had heard of them. The Defaced were a resistance group. No one knew who they were, or the true identity of their leader, a mysterious figure who called herself Delegate Zero. But they were always in the news, most recently for hacking into the servers of a surveillance company and erasing all its data.\n\u201cYou expect me to believe you\u2019re a member?\u201d I scoffed. \u201cAnyone can say that. The whole point is that no one knows what they look like.\u201d\nI tried to imagine the man\u2019s face peering out from a mugshot, chin up, eyes defiant. I couldn\u2019t picture it. He looked too much like a middle-school algebra teacher.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t talk here.\u201d His eyes darted to the security camera mounted on the doorway of the nearest building. \u201cBut if you come to this address, someone will explain.\u201d He handed me a slip of paper. \u201cWhen you get there, ask for the Grandmother\u2019s Special,\u201d he added.\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m supposed to meet you at a random location and just hope you\u2019re telling the truth?\u201d\n\u201cNo, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about.\u201d He shook his head firmly. \u201cIt won\u2019t be me, someone else will find you there. You\u2019ll never see me again.\u201d\nThere was something in his tone, a grave urgency, that made me believe him. And he was right. I never did see him again.\n*\nThe address was 375 Lyndon Street. When I got there, I found a family-owned pizzeria in a run-down part of town. It was empty inside, except for a teenage waitress playing a game on her phone. I went to the counter and ordered the Grandmother\u2019s Special.\nThe waitress rolled her eyes and gestured at a door marked Employees Only. \u201cShe\u2019s in the back.\u201d\nI don\u2019t know what I was expecting. A dim bunker filled with weapons? A crowd of people wearing masks?\nBut it was just a regular storage room, with sacks of semolina flour stacked along the back wall and a gray-haired woman sitting at a desk.\nWhen I stepped in the room, the woman took out a camera and snapped a photo of me. Then another. The bright flash made me blink.\n\u201cVery good,\u201d she murmured. She looked at me as if I was a circus animal that had just performed a particularly impressive trick. She turned the screen toward me. \u201cNo face detected.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s always been like that.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you never sought to fix it? An untouched illegible. You are a singular woman, my dear.\u201d She moved closer and examined my features. \u201cMay I?\u201d she asked. I nodded, not entirely sure what I was agreeing to.\nShe grasped my chin in her hand and rotated my head from side to side. \u201cVery good, indeed. Did you know there are 43 muscles in the human face?\u201d\n\u201cUm, no? Don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard that.\u201d\n\u201cI was a student of anatomy. Until I was drawn to \u2014 other pursuits.\u201d She had an odd way of speaking, overdramatic, as if she were revealing a winning poker hand, laying down each word with a flourish. \u201cI still call upon my medical training to carry out certain projects.\u201d\nShe returned to her desk and opened the top drawer, pulling out a metal tray. On top of the tray was an array of hypodermic needles. She picked up one of the syringes. \u201cIt is a dermal filler. Calcium hydroxylapatite and hyaluronic acid. When injected into the skin, it can change the facial proportions. The effect is temporary, however, and overuse causes permanent deformities.\u201d Her lips turned down in a frown. \u201cThe algorithms continue to improve. It is becoming harder to fool them with our amateur modifications. But you, my dear. Completely undetectable. That is a rare trait indeed.\u201d\nShe placed the tray back in the drawer and shut it with a bang. \u201cNow. Tell me why you have come here today.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you might be able to help me. Or, maybe I can help you.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I imagine you can. You must be angry, dear. I certainly would be, in your position. No job. No opportunities. Not even a real person, in their eyes.\u201d\nI gave her a skeptical look. \u201cSo what if I\u2019m angry? It doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d\n\u201cAnger \u2026 it can be a productive emotion. If you learn how to harness it. Today we are both in luck. We have been waiting for someone like you. And I expect you will find the work \u2026 rewarding.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of work?\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? With a face like that, you could slip into any building you like. The New York Stock Exchange. The White House. there will be no shortage of things for you to do.\u201d\nThis was why people called the Defaced a terrorist group. Terrorism. Activism. I suppose it\u2019s only a matter of perspective.\n\u201cAnd me? What do I get?\u201d\nShe looked at me consideringly. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve always wanted. A chance to be somebody that no one can forget.\u201d","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

I had never been there before, but it has been my sister\u2019s home forever. We sat on the sand, running rivulets of it through our fingers, and gazed across the water at the city while we talked.\n\u201cTell me about your life,\u201d my sister urged me, and so I did. I told her about my two children, her niece and her nephew; about my son-in-law, who cooks and bakes wonderful meals; and about my young grandson.\n\u201cHe loves trucks,\u201d I told her. \u201cWhen he sees a truck, he comes to a complete standstill and says, \u2018Truck! Vroom!\u2019 He has a toddler truck bed and a rug in his room with trucks on it.\u201d\nI showed her photographs of everyone on my phone.\n\u201cSo how are you?\u201d I asked her.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she replied. \u201cAll days are the same here. I sit here on the sand most days, unless it is raining, and I look across the water. When it rains, I sit over there.\u201d She pointed to a small pavilion with benches surrounded by trees and flowers. \u201cI love flowers,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you?\u201d\n\u201cYes. We both inherited that from Mom. She was a great gardener. She planted peonies and viburnum at my first house, and when we downsized to a smaller house and yard, she planted flowers. Last year I planted purple and pink flowers and felt vaguely guilty because she never liked purple rhododendrons, but the flowers looked wonderful, and I think she would have liked them, too.\u201d\n\u201cThe flowers are always lovely here,\u201d my sister said. \u201cI like marigolds, and I especially like dahlias.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m remembering that Mom loved music as much she loved flowers. I\u2019ve kept up with the piano, but I\u2019ve forgotten how to play the cello and the guitar.\u201d\n\u201cI like music, too,\u201d my sister said. \u201cI can hear it when the wind is right and wafts the notes over from a concert in the city. It\u2019s wonderful. \u201d\nWhen evening began to nibble at the edges of late afternoon, I got up and brushed off bits of sand from my pants.\n\u201cI think I should go now,\u201d I said.\n\u201cIt was wonderful to see you,\u201d my sister replied, looking up at me.\n\u201cThere\u2019s one more thing I want to know,\u201d I said. \u201cEither I never knew, or I forgot. When is your birthday?\u201d\nMy sister spoke, but there was a sudden gust of wind.\n\u201cI can\u2019t hear you!\u201d I called as the wind pushed me away and the distance between us widened. \u201cNever mind!\u201d I called, half-stumbling. \u201cI\u2019m glad we had this day together!\u201d\n\u201cI am too,\u201d she called back, waving to me.\nThe boat was waiting for me at the edge of the island, and I climbed over its sloped edge into my assigned seat.\n\u201cBuckle in,\u201d the boatman reminded me, and so I did. \u201cWe\u2019re headed to your next stop. I\u2019m sure you know that people are waiting for you. Did you enjoy your day with your sister?\u201d\n\u201cVery much,\u201d I replied.\nIt was at that moment I realized I also didn\u2019t know her name. Perhaps my parents hadn\u2019t named her, since she was stillborn.\nShe was immediately taken, in the custom of that time, to the city island and buried in an unmarked grave, and my parents were told to go home and try again. I was born several years later.\n\u201cI was so happy on the morning you were born that I cut myself shaving,\u201d my father always told me. \u201cI sang to myself in the mirror: I have a little girl! I have a daughter! I have a baby girl!\u201d\n\u201cTell me the story again,\u201d I would say, and he would.\nThey are all gone, and now I am gone, too. I will never know my sister\u2019s birthday or her name. But I finally saw her, and now I know that my sister also loves flowers and music.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

The first hint that I was near my destination was the glimmer of the plastic sheets flapping in the desert breeze. It was still early \u2014 I tried to do most of my walking in the small hours, and sleep through the burning heat of the afternoon.\nI first heard about the colony some years back. In fact, I had been at Christchurch College, Oxford, with the founder, Tom Novak. He had been a physicist in those days, whilst I was studying medicine.\nBoth of us had squandered our early promise. I had simply refused to ascend the career ladder, knocking around various physician jobs on cruise ships and in hotels.\nNovak, meanwhile, had left England for the United States after graduating. He finished his PhD. at UCLA in two years and took up a research post in the Department of Physics and Astronomy. Soon after, during at a conference at the Excalibur Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas, he walked out one night and vanished into the Nevada Desert.\nMy alumni magazine even ran an obituary a few months before he re-surfaced as the leader of a newly formed cult.\nNovak\u2019s group rejected anything that ran on electricity. Their literature consisted of hand-written leaflets on thick, homemade paper. They had a surprisingly wide circle of sympathizers who would distribute them in Las Vegas, beneath placemats in restaurants, under hotel pillows and so forth. From Las Vegas, the leaflets found their way into the wider world, and hence onto the Internet.\nNovak attracted some attention, most of it derisory: Of all the unusual beliefs held by cults, opposing electricity was one of the most ridiculous. People would have understood Novak\u2019s point of view if it had been five years ago, when everyone was worried about the amount of coal and oil and gas we had left to burn, and what the byproducts were doing to the atmosphere.\nBut to object to electricity just at the point when we were about to get a limitless source of clean, wireless energy was just perverse.\nGleam was a technology developed by a private multinational corporation. It promised to make our old system of cables and plug sockets as antiquated as dial-up. It involved two major breakthroughs.\nThe first was a method for generating power from hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor. The second was a way of transmitting this power, wirelessly, across vast distances. The technology was safe, clean and durable; the manufacturers estimated that once an ocean station was set up, it could run for over fifty years with minimal maintenance.\nLike everyone else, I was initially skeptical of Gleam. It seemed like a distraction from the real issue: How were we going to manage what we had? Chasing after another version of cold fusion or the perpetual motion machine struck me as a frivolous distraction at best, or downright obstructive at worst.\nBut then, who was I to complain? I was happily installed as the hotel medic for 2525, a new casino on the Las Vegas strip with a kitschy 1950s futuristic theme. My employer was running up some of the biggest electricity bills on in town, against some pretty stiff competition.\nThe first tests of Gleam exceeded expectations, and soon the industrialized nations agreed to pay a massive lump sum to install and operate Gleam across the globe.\nThe advantages were obvious; it would solve climate change with no need for anyone to alter their lifestyle. Gleam-driven desalination plants would solve the water crisis. Old power stations could be shut down, kept as tourist attractions perhaps, like the stately homes of England.\nTraditional cars were scrapped, and sales of new-build Gleam vehicles provided a much-needed shot in the arm for the automobile industry. Cable-free electrical items became common in the shops.\nWithin a couple of years, the world had entirely switched over to Gleam, and luddites like Novak, stuck out in the desert with his pitiful colony of cranks, were entirely forgotten about.\nEveryone has a story about where they were when Gleam went wrong. This is mine.\nI had been working late in my office, inputting body mass indices, smoking status, alcohol intake and so on into my computer. I finished at last, rubbed my eyes, and turned off my desk lamp.\nI say I turned it off; what actually happened was that I flicked the switch on my desk lamp, and it stayed on.\nI made a mental note to get it fixed the next day. Then I shut down my computer. The screen darkened and the fans clicked to a halt; there was less than a second\u2019s pause before the machine made a soft ping and started up again.\nAnnoyed with myself for pressing restart, I tried again, making sure this time that I hit the \u201cshut down\u201d button.\nThis time, it didn\u2019t shut down at all. I decided to leave it, like the lamp, for tomorrow. After all, it could hardly do any damage to leave things switched on these days. I put on my jacket, went to the door and touched the light switch. The light didn\u2019t go out. I added it to my \u2018to do\u2019 list.\nI made my way back to my room. 2525 was like all Vegas hotels \u2014 to get anywhere, you had to go via the casino floor. It was around eight o\u2019clock at night, but it could have been eight o\u2019clock in the morning, or any time in between.\nThere was no natural light; neon and lasers provided a constantly changing display, bouncing off the chrome surfaces. Waitresses in short metallic skirts, see-through plastic tops and silver wigs carried drinks from table to table. They had to shout to make themselves heard over the din of conversation and pumping electronic music, punctuated by the occasional downpour of coins from the mouths of the slot machines.\nI caught sight of Mary, someone I\u2019d been involved with in an on-off Vegas way for a few weeks. She pulled a plastic ray gun from her holster, pointed it at me and pulled the trigger theatrically, mouthing the word \u201cpow.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t know what that meant, and I wasn\u2019t in the mood to find out. I was still irritated by the problems I\u2019d had with the electrics in my office. Gleam had made me take technology for granted; everything had become so reliable you almost stopped noticing it was there. A glitch like this was unsettling.\nI gave a quick wave and a complicated shrug that indicated I had somewhere to go, and walked swiftly between the machines, tables and tourists, away from the cacophony.\nThe night before I reached Novak\u2019s colony, I had become aware of a flickering, ghostly light behind a ridge up ahead. As I approached, I heard what sounded like a babble of voices, music, white noise, all competing with one another, like a party before you find your friends and tune into a single conversation.\nWhen I traversed the ridge, I found a large stack of television sets, all switched on and flipping themselves rapidly through the channels. I moved closer, to see if I could find one broadcasting anything useful. It was impossible to distinguish any individual voice, and in any case, the channels were changing every couple of seconds.\nMy room in 2525 was on the ground floor. Casino medics pooled their evening duties, and it was one of my nights off. I decided that I would have a quiet night in, ask the kitchen to send me a pizza, and watch a couple of movies on TV. I swiped my card in the lock, and the green light flashed.\nI walked in. All of the lights were on, in both the main room and the bathroom. So was the TV.\nThis had happened before. The chambermaids had plenty of rooms to get through, and they tended to neglect the ones occupied by staff. It wasn\u2019t unusual, in fact, for me to come back and find more evidence of a coffee break taking place in my room than of any actual cleaning.\nI pressed \u201cmute\u201d on the remote control, walked across to the bathroom, and slid my finger over the touch-sensitive pad that controlled the light. The light stayed on. I wondered if there was a manufacturing fault with the switches in the hotel, causing them to all pack in at the same time. And what was wrong with an old-fashioned rocker switch, anyway?\nThe television suddenly burst into life.\n\u201c \u2014 electrical fault affecting some rooms. Engineers have been called and are trying to resolve the problem as soon as possible. Meanwhile, why not unwind with the Rockettes in our Launch Pad Lounge \u2026\u201d\nIt was the hotel TV channel, presented live from the casino floor by an actor who had played Flash Gordon or possibly Buck Rogers in a re-vamped show that lasted about six episodes ten years ago. I opened up a beer from my fridge, slipped off my shoes and sat down on my bed.\nThere was a crumpling sound as I reclined against my pillows: I lifted them, and found a thick, brownish piece of paper, foolscap size, inked in neatly printed black letters:\n\u201cGLEAM: SOMETHING FOR NOTHING? THE HOUSE ALWAYS WINS!\u201d\nIt was another leaflet from Novak. I skimmed through it and put it in the bin.\n\u201c\u2014 other hotels on the strip may be affected by this problem, which we expect to be fixed within the next hour or two,\u201d the television said.\nI flicked it over to a movie that looked like it didn\u2019t require too much attention. I called for my pizza, and opened another bottle of beer.\nI fell asleep before the end of the film, and woke up to find the TV still on. It was a little after seven. The noise was competing with a news report coming out of my clock radio. I tried to switch off the TV, failed, and then attempted to mute it. The sound cut out for just a second before coming back on.\nI tried to hear what the man on the radio was saying. His voice sounded serious and urgent. I threw my duvet over the television, muffling it.\n\u201c\u2014 affecting not just Las Vegas, but cities across Nevada,\u201d the radio said.\nIt was difficult to judge distance in the desert, and my initial burst of energy on seeing Novak\u2019s settlement soon dwindled. By the time I reached the first huts, I was exhausted and thirsty, and my head was pounding. I had not taken enough water when I started my expedition, and I was running seriously low. In the previous twenty-four hours, my sole intake had consisted of a mouthful of lukewarm, plasticky water, washing down a melted chocolate bar.\nThere were no signs outside the encampment, no gates, no guards. I counted around two-dozen huts and a couple of caravans. The majority looked new and clean: evidently the size of Novak\u2019s camp had swelled significantly over the past couple of months.\nA woman dressed in a blue pinafore was playing with a small child in the dusty yard around the front of one of the cabins. I waved at her. She looked up, squinting into the light, and adjusted her red headscarf.\n\u201cHello!\u201d I said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to shout,\u201d she replied, primly.\nHad I been shouting? I supposed I must have got used to raising my voice before I left the city.\nThe sole distinction in my medical career is probably this: I treated one of the first casualties of Gleam.\nI was listening to the news report, which continued to say not very much, when my phone rang. Someone hurt in room 401, blood loss, ambulance dispatched but I was needed to hold the fort until it arrived.\nThis wasn\u2019t the kind of thing I was used to as a hotel doctor. The majority of the work involved treating emphysema and heart failure in the numerous elderly patients who used the cheap room rates, plentiful food, daytime activities, and ever-present company to turn the casino into a viable alternative to an old folks\u2019 home.\nI grabbed the orange emergency holdall and hurried out of my room.\nThe casino floor was filled with people milling around in last night\u2019s makeup and yesterday\u2019s clothes, smelling of stale alcohol, their faces vague and distant as if they weren\u2019t fully aware of their surroundings.\nIn other words, things were still normal.\nI headed for the lifts. There was, however, a crowd around the doors, and as I watched, the chrome dial indicating the floor the lift was on flipped back and forth like a Geiger counter.\nI took the stairs at speed, the bag getting heavier on my shoulder as I approached the fourth floor. Fortunately, 401 was situated near the stairwell, and there was a steward standing in the corridor to point me to the room in question.\nI hastened in and threw the bag down. A middle-aged man, dressed in a bathrobe, lay flat out on a bright red rug; a darker, brownish puddle of red was welling up over his right shoulder.\nThere was a tang of cordite in the air, and a substantial dent in the metal cabinet that the television rested on. The television itself was still on.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t turn off the damn TV,\u201d he yelled, \u201cso I decided to shoot it out!\u201d\nThis was, I would soon discover, a typical reaction to Gleam\u2019s malfunction.\nThe woman in the pinafore directed me to a large, silver caravan in the centre of the settlement. I walked up the steps and banged on the door. I rested my hand on the metal; it was warm to the touch.\nThe door opened to reveal a man in his early thirties. His blonde hair was long, with streaks of silver; he brushed it away from his face, revealing a pair of thick glasses fixed and fixed again with duct tape. He was wearing navy polka-dot pajamas and a tartan dressing gown.\n\u201cNick?\u201d he exclaimed, and extended his hand. I shook it; in the years since we had last met, it had become rough and calloused.\n\u201cTwo Englishmen far from home,\u201d he said.\nBy the end of that first day when nothing would switch off, Gleam had malfunctioned across the whole of North America. The rest of the world soon followed.\n2525 responded with a special announcement, made by ex-Flash\/Buck. It played end-to-end on the hotel channel. Guests were reassured that the government and the Gleam Corporation were working to resolve the problem. Guests were advised not to try deactivating hotel electrical items themselves; management would remove these on request.\nThese arrangements broke down after about a week. Staff were becoming exhausted constantly shifting television sets and light bulbs back and forth; the lifts had been forcibly stopped in a daring rescue mission by the fire service and were beyond repair; and there were hints that the Gleam problem was getting worse.\nThe air conditioning was now being driven full blast, so that people were either walking around clad in blankets or breaking windows to let in some warmth.\nThe infrared-controlled taps in the washrooms were permanently on, and there were worries about a potential drought.\nAll airplanes were grounded, and cars were beginning to have problems with their electrical systems.\nEveryone was going to have to stay in Vegas, at least until Gleam was fixed.\nNovak opened a hatch set into the base of his caravan, and pulled out a thick glass pitcher, with large droplets of moisture running down the sides.\n\u201cIced tea?\u201d he asked, then added, apologetically, \u201cWell, not iced, but cool at least.\u201d\nHe poured me a glass of the brown, clear liquid. I drunk it greedily, savoring the taste of citrus and tannins.\n\u201cIt took me a long time to devise a way to cool tea to just the right temperature,\u201d he said, \u201cbut isn\u2019t that the way it should be?\u201d\n\u201cI read your leaflets,\u201d I said.\n\u201cIt made everything too easy,\u201d he said, \u201celectricity.\u201d\nIt was as if he was talking to himself. He scrutinized me. \u201cYou used to wear glasses.\u201d\n\u201cI had my eyes lasered.\u201d\n\u201cYou see what I mean,\u201d he said, \u201cit makes things too easy. Things are meant to be difficult sometimes. We need to make choices \u2013 so much effort for so much reward.\u201d\n\u201cAre you talking about Gleam?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Not specifically. Gleam was just the latest example. The idea that everything in life should be easy. It\u2019s like being addicted to a drug.\u201d Novak got up and drew back the curtain over the main window. The morning light shimmered off his glasses. \u201cRight now, everyone is going through withdrawal.\u201d\nThe hotel tried to run a new system of \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d suites: you would have two sets of rooms, one with everything plugged in and switched on, the other with everything removed.\nSoon the news came that a flotilla of Navy submarines sent to destroy Gleam installations had been lost without trace.\nI reckoned things wouldn\u2019t get back to normal, not for a long time, perhaps not ever.\nI cleared a space on the table amongst the papers and candles, and put down my glass.\n\u201cWhat happened to you, Novak?\u201d I asked, \u2018\u201cwhy did you come out here all those years ago?\u201d\n\u201cI had an evening off at the conference. I played the slots.\u201d\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d\n\u201cI put in one dollar, and I made one hundred.\u201d\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\nNovak topped up my glass with the rest of the iced tea.\n\u201cI thought,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat if everyone in this casino could do what I just did? What if everyone could make a hundred dollars that easily?\u201d\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t be done,\u201d I said.\n\u201cNow you say that.\u201d\nI stood on the strip, and looked at the city for the last time. Arcs of lightning fired between the pylons, and the air hummed and tingled against my skin.\nThe street was deserted apart from a few people; looking closer, I saw that they walked with the awkward, silent-movie jerk that indicated their nervous systems were now under the control of Gleam.\nI could smell something acrid and synthetic, like melting tires. The sky was a burnt orange colour, and the stars were invisible.\nI hitched my rucksack onto my back, and walked out into the desert.\nNiall Boyce lives and works in London.

They felt awkward or resentful. But you had to admit, it was helpful to know where everyone stood.\nTake for instance this guy I met at a party a few months after the government started labeling. Guy was RACIST and yammering on about immigrants being this and that, and I could tell he really enjoyed it because he didn\u2019t have to pretend to be DIPLOMATIC or SENSITIVE anymore.\nI have nothing against immigrants and the guy was wearing a purple track suit so I was like, \u201cBuddy, you\u2019re an idiot and you look like a pimp.\u201d\nHe clenched his fist like he was going to sock me one good but then he read my label \u2014 JUDGMENTAL \u2014 and he just nodded and relaxed. No harm done!\nThere were a few early hiccups. Folks labeled LIAR, CHEATER, and LAZY, for example, complained that they couldn\u2019t get jobs, apartments, insurance policies, or bank accounts, so pretty quickly, the government made it illegal to discriminate on the basis of label.\nIt still happened though. Gatekeepers just got stealthier. Like when I applied for a job managing a home for teen mothers. The boss, who was DISCERNING, took one look at my label and told me I was up against more qualified people who just happened to be CARING and OPEN-MINDED. Fair enough. It wasn\u2019t a good fit.\nTurned out fine because a week later I got a better-paying job at a marketing firm. My future boss, OPPORTUNISTIC, hired me on the spot. He said his two veteran staff, CREATIVE and MISUNDERSTOOD, wasted too much time and money on cockamamie ideas and he could use a little JUDGMENTAL. I\u2019ve been there for seven years now and I get respect. Anyone who doesn\u2019t agree is probably STUPID.\nThe labeling process was initially cumbersome but they streamlined it over the years. Now, when you turn 18, the government convenes a jury \u2014 family, friends, workmates, classmates, teachers, rivals, and enemies. If you\u2019re summoned for duty it\u2019s hard to refuse but you get paid time off so it\u2019s all good. There\u2019s a submission period when anyone can suggest a label, including yourself.\nOf course everyone wants LOVING or GENEROUS or GENIUS but those are hard to get because after submissions, they body-cam actors to interact with you for a couple months to see what you\u2019re really like. (None of the actors can be ACTOR, obviously. That would give them away.)\nOnce your label arrives from the Ministry of Branding, you have to wear it on a chain around your neck or else they throw you in jail. The first labels were big heavy things that were overly burdensome for people who were FATIGUED or FRAIL. After enough complaints, the MoB started making them out of some New Age plastic and everyone was relieved.\nA couple years ago, they started allowing relabeling for people stuck with lousy tags like BORING or FLATULENT, or people who evolved beyond their original labels. It\u2019s expensive, though, and you can only do it once.\nYou\u2019d think finding a mate would be easy because your true self is right there, on display. No games. But love\u2019s not sensible. I\u2019d meet some sexy dame and life would be great for a while and then I\u2019d start judging and everything would go to hell.\nOnce I dated this knockout who was MOTHERING. I thought, that\u2019s what I need, someone to take care of me! She was constantly stroking my ego, making melted cheese snacks, buying me high-end boxer briefs, correcting my math. We\u2019d barely be out of bed in the morning and she would smooth out the sheets behind us.\nThing was, after six months or so, she stopped caring about her looks. Her hair grew stringy and she developed a taste for doughnuts, if you know what I mean. One day I told her she was looking a bit frumpy and she said maybe I should find someone SHALLOW and I said maybe she should find someone BLIND.\nIt\u2019s hard to come back from stuff like that so we broke up.\nFunny thing was, I did meet a woman later who was SHALLOW. She was hot, sure, but insufferable. All she did was diet and primp and shop and talk about her workouts and after a while, I yearned for passion and a little conversation. When I told her I needed someone more COMPLEX or INSIGHTFUL, she said whatever, she\u2019d been seeing WELL-HUNG on the side.\nI was hurt and told her so. She just smiled and cracked her sugarless gum and walked away in her high boots and short shorts.\nThat night I went out with my best friend, SHAMELESS. We were like two peas in a pod at the bar. I\u2019d scan the room and tell him what was wrong with everybody and he\u2019d point out the women he wanted to take home and why. It was usually fun, but not this time. I was down and SHAMELESS wasn\u2019t helping at all. I told him about my latest break-up and lamented that I might never find a soulmate.\n\u201cBut they know you\u2019re JUDGMENTAL, it\u2019s right there!\u201d he said.\nI said, \u201cSure, but maybe people don\u2019t want to hear the truth.\u201d\nHe said, \u201cBig deal! Date \u2018em and dump \u2018em!\u201d\nAnd I said, \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing and it makes me feel empty.\u201d\nHe nodded and hastened to point out that I was in my mid-30s and that pretty soon, it would be impossible for JUDGMENTAL to find a lover. I told him that was cruel. He said not cruel, SHAMELESS, and tapped his label with his pint glass.\nWhen I got home that night, I couldn\u2019t shake what SHAMELESS had said. Time was running out for me. I poured a Scotch and thought back to when I became JUDGMENTAL. I was disappointed at first but eventually found it liberating. I could say anything about anyone and not feel guilty about it.\nBut what good is freedom on a deserted island? My life had become so small. I couldn\u2019t be part of any religion or club because the leaders were all PIOUS nutjobs. I stopped voting because no one was ever good enough. I gave up on the social causes I fought for in my youth because there was always some MEGALOMANIAC stealing everyone\u2019s thunder. Other than SHAMELESS, my only friends were OBLIVIOUS and DIM and they were hardly a barrel of laughs.\nThere was a guy from work I hung out with sometimes, ASS-KISSER, but our conversations always got weird. I\u2019d be ridiculing co-workers left and right and he\u2019d just smile and hedge.\nI was starting to wonder if JUDGMENTAL was holding me back from my true potential. Maybe it was time for relabeling.\nI called in sick for a few days and wandered around, reading people\u2019s chests, buoyed by the prospect of a fresh identity and a second chance. I figured there was no point applying for relabeling if you weren\u2019t first considering what labels might fit, especially since you only had one shot. I\u2019d have to focus on something and start living the part to convince the jury.\nIt would be tricky but not impossible. I\u2019d never seen a politician or captain of industry who was SNEAKY or SELFISH, for example. They were always TRUSTWORTHY, LEADER, or STRONG, so there was obviously a way to buck the system.\n\u201cI want to be FEARLESS,\u201d I told SHAMELESS, a couple days later.\n\u201cGood one,\u201d he said. \u201cChicks\u2019ll dig that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not all about the chicks,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s about shifting the rudder and going somewhere else, becoming a better you.\u201d\n\u201cHuh. Maybe you should be HACKNEYED instead.\u201d\n\u201cScrew you,\u201d I said and he said, \u201cGuess you can scratch POLITE.\u201d\nI downed my rusty nail and motioned for the bartender, who was RELAXED, to bring me another. He did, but he sure took his time doing it. We didn\u2019t say anything for a bit, just watched sports highlights on the TV behind the bar.\n\u201cListen,\u201d SHAMELESS finally said. \u201cWhat happens if you become, like, TOLERANT or SYMPATHETIC? Would we still be friends?\u201d\n\u201cOf course!\u201d I said. But I\u2019d actually been wondering the same thing.\nI gave FEARLESS an honest try. I took a snowboarding lesson from CHILL but never made it off the bunny hill. I told the PERKY server at Taj Cuisine that yes, I did want my chicken tikka India hot and then panted, tongue out, for two full days.\nWho was I kidding? I was a total chickenshit. It\u2019s probably why JUDGMENTAL had fit so well \u2014 it\u2019s easier to find fault with others than to look closely at yourself. After FEARLESS failed, I tried something totally bland and safe: PRECISE. That should have been easy, right? Nope. Because sometimes I like Pinot Grigio with salmon and sometimes I like Beaujolais! I tried being HUMOROUS, kept it up for about a week, but let me tell you, it\u2019s harder than it looks. You have to be INTELLIGENT and SHARP to be FUNNY and I\u2019m none of those. I had to quit or else risk being labelled TEDIOUS.\nCONFIDENT would be a great label to show the world. I was going to be CONFIDENT, goddamn it! At work, I kept right on judging people and ideas, just more confidently. But when co-workers like PICKY asked what made me so sure about this new ad campaign or that promo idea, I stammered and made shit up.\nTruth is, I was starting to question where my opinions had come from in the first place. Perhaps I was, in fact, IMPOSTER.\nI sat home one night, making a new list of labels \u2014 not things that sounded good but things I actually was. It was a sad little list: TIDY, HELPFUL, READER, RESTLESS, BEER-LOVER.\nWhat I didn\u2019t add, but should have, was LOSER. How I envied the CARPENTERs, MUSICIANs, FATHERs and ARTISTs. Oh sure, they might be PETTY or VENGEFUL inside but no one would know, would they? They could just hide behind that benign label their whole life.\nI crumpled up my list and choked back burgeoning self-pity. Maybe I was taking the label thing too seriously. The sign around your neck didn\u2019t mean you were only that. It was just a bureaucratic thing, a trend in social engineering. In fact, I\u2019d just read about groups forming to protest labels and demand they be abolished. Anti-labelers were finding ways to subvert the process. I saw a guy on the bus recently who was UNDEFINED and laughed out loud. How did he do it?\nEventually I just said the hell with it. I was going to live in the moment and try to be myself, whoever that was. I stopped hanging with SHAMELESS, worried that he was a bad influence. He left messages for a while then stopped. I felt SHAMEFUL but I was on a road to discovery and that meant ditching old habits. I tried some new things to distract myself and life suddenly felt lighter, more relaxed.\nI took a Mexican cooking class. It was tough keeping my mouth shut when NEEDY and her lame husband PROTECTIVE totally botched the empanadas but I can make a killer salsa verde now.\nI enrolled in a bike maintenance course at the community college from a woman who was DILIGENT but should have been IRRITATING. She made us change a tire six times before letting us pass. IMPATIENT nearly lost her mind but at least now we can all save a shit-ton of money we used to waste at upscale bike shops.\nI attended a community-association meeting to find out what was happening in the neighborhood. The president was DISTRACTED so the meetings dragged on and on and I\u2019ll never do that again, but I chalked it all up to personal growth. I was growing so much, in fact, that I was starting to resent JUDGMENTAL. People were judging me for being JUDGMENTAL and I was damn tired of it!\nSo off I went to the MoB to fill out my application. I got a little thrill when I signed my name at the bottom. Hello clean slate!\nWhen I handed my paperwork to the lady behind the counter, I shrugged and whispered, \u201cI\u2019m just not JUDGMENTAL anymore.\u201d\n\u201cNice,\u201d she said, with the warmest smile ever. \u201cIt takes guts to shed your skin. Maybe you\u2019ll end up COURAGEOUS!\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem MOROSE,\u201d I said, pointing to her label.\nShe sighed. \u201cI went through a bad patch after high school.\u201d\n\u201cSucks,\u201d I said.\nHer colleague CHEERFUL came over and picked up a stack of applications.\n\u201cChrist\u201d she said, \u201cthese losers\u2019ll keep me busy \u2019til kingdom come! What makes \u2018em think they\u2019re so special?\u201d She harrumphed and stormed off.\n\u201cShe\u2019s not very CHEERFUL,\u201d MOROSE whispered.\n\u201cMaybe you should switch,\u201d I joked. She giggled then glanced at the closed circuit camera above us and composed herself. \u201cThat\u2019s against the law,\u201d she said gravely.\n\u201cToo bad,\u201d I said. I walked out of there convinced that labeling was a really dumb law.\nSo now it\u2019s a year later and I\u2019m a new man. I\u2019d always loved dogs so I took a course and now I run Who\u2019s a Good Doggie? Obedience School. Business is booming. Last week I got a silver award from the Chamber of Commerce in the Best New Small-to-Medium Business (Service) category.\nThen one day SHALLOW came in with a Dalmatian puppy \u2014 but she wasn\u2019t SHALLOW anymore.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cBeing SHALLOW was tiring and monotonous,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were ADVENTUROUS,\u201d I said, nodding at her new label.\n\u201cI actually am,\u201d she said, showing off a fresh octopus tattoo wrapped around her upper arm.\n\u201cWow,\u201d I said. It was a bit garish but I tried not to judge.\n\u201cAnd you,\u201d she said, nodding to my new label and laughing. \u201cHow in the world did you pull that off?\u201d\nI shrugged demurely. When the class was over, she said it was great to see me and hugged me a little longer than expected. We\u2019re going steady again. I might even marry the girl, who knows?\nI ran into SHAMELESS at the gym the other day. He\u2019s ROMANTIC now.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a switch,\u201d I said, pointing to the little Velcro label people wear when they\u2019re doing sports.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy but it gets me chicks,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s totally SHAMELESS,\u201d I said.\n\u201cPretty much,\u201d he said, resuming his set of bicep curls.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

That San Francisco seems exotically technicolor to me now, like one of those planets the Enterprise visits that seems just like Earth but isn\u2019t Earth at all, for reasons that are never explained \u2014 like that one when Kirk lands on the planet of children where disease kills all the adults.\nI guess I was about ten when I realized that I, and everyone around me, had gotten on an Enterprise that took us from one Earth to another.\nFor a long time, everything was weirdly wrong, like the water on the streets and the bodies in the water. The adults were scared of the water and the bodies, but we kids loved the way things fell apart and turned the whole city into a playground.\nBut then we got old and the new San Francisco became home and the old one seemed to glow just a bit in our memories, and everything that had been strange got dull.\nI keep searching for strangeness. I guess that\u2019s why I played the game. They say it\u2019s an escape, but I think in gamespace, where we strip away the meat, you can see what people really are.\nHe came over the foothills like a monument to himself: eyes the color of ambergris, skin of brass, tall as an adolescent elephant. Centaurs were rare that year; none of us had ever seen a creature as beautiful.\nHis name was Nessos.\nHe brought treasure \u2014 silver coins and gold chalices, glimmering gems and singing seashells \u2014 carried in twin parfleche panniers slung across his back. His only other dress was a cuirass and a feather-lined scabbard, from which sprang the gold pommel of a broadsword.\nI need a clan, he said. Yours will have to do.\nAcross the granite slab at the center of our encampment he spread his loot, and offered his sword in our service.\nWe talked it over in the bark-covered longhouse.\nHe\u2019s pretty, said Panpipe, one of two griffins in Chancre Clan.\nHe\u2019s rich, said Oropher, an elf, and our chief.\nHe\u2019ll be good in a fight, said Cray, who was, for some reason, human.\nI had to pee. I had thought before about keeping a jar by the desk, but I didn\u2019t want my mom to find it.\nJin, you there?\nYo.\nThe new guy\u2019s registered as Philip Arnold, which sounds like a bullshit pseudonym. I\u2019m googling.\nI\u2019m trying some other stuff.\nI got nothing. You?\nI got an IP address, a host name, and a location.\nOh, yeah? Where\u2019s he live?\nSan Francisco.\nNo shit. Maybe he\u2019s a neighbor.\nWhy does he want to join us?\nI turned down the intensity of the wajang and the world seeped in past the gamespace. In the distance I heard a vaporetto chug down the canal. My stomach growled. I still had to pee.\nI was still capped, still half in the gamespace; overlaying the sight and stench of my bedroom, I could smell the bark and feel the close, humid air of the longhouse.\nIn retrospect it\u2019s obvious we shouldn\u2019t have taken him in, but at the time it seemed like a good idea.\nTruth is, we hadn\u2019t won a battle in thirty days, and thieves and raiders were nipping at what treasure horde we still had. All we could do was man the earthworks, spears in hands and claws, and hope the gods would be kind that night. We needed new blood and a new sword.\nAs we voted to invite Nessos to join us, Golub raised the alarm. We raced from the longhouse where we\u2019d been meeting, Nessos falling in behind.\nWe saw in a moment that a huge pack of human nomads were streaming into the valley like hairy, two-legged ants.\nYou\u2019re in, Oropher told Nessos over his shoulder.\nJust in time, I see, said Nessos.\nWe braced ourselves at the ramparts for the assault, staring down into the yellows of a hundred wild eyes, but Nessos didn\u2019t wait. With a roar, he charged over the earthwork and thrust his sword through the lead raider\u2019s lungs.\nThe next raider jabbed at Nessos with a spear while a third, scimitar held high, looped around to his rear.\nNessos kicked back and sent the third man flying into the air and over the earthworks, his neck broken and his ears bleeding.\nThe spear nicked a foreleg, but Nessos was already pushing backward, sword slashing down. His well-muscled, brassy reach was longer than the spear\u2019s, and the man fell to the ground with his skull split and spilling brains.\nWe shouted and cheered and charged over the earthworks, taking the fight to the nomads.\nSure, it was lousy tactics. We were outnumbered. We should have dug in and let the raiders wear themselves out on assaults.\nBut we were sick of hiding behind piles of dirt and though he\u2019d only just joined our clan, Nessos seemed to sense our mood.\nCutting and stabbing and slashing, blood and brains and bowels: it\u2019d been many months since we\u2019d had so much reckless fun in a fight.\nIn ten minutes the nomads were retreating into the foothills, harried by our arrows. Swords aloft, we jeered at their backsides and Nessos pranced at the center of our little mob, metal flanks shimmering with sweat, grey eyes haughty and fierce.\nTake a look at the bookie sites.\nAnyone who took the points made a pile.\nWe\u2019ll be the underdog for a while yet.\nLet me check my account \u2026 nice. Thirty thousand nue yuan.\nI can buy my girlfriend something.\nYou have a girlfriend?\nMy mom is calling. Gotta uncap.\nI took the glasses off and uncapped. My mom really was calling.\nAnd now I really was hungry. Starving.\nI delicately took my coffee cup down from my shelf, careful not to slosh the amber liquid; I took it across the hall to the bathroom and dumped it in the toilet.\nDownstairs, Mom was in the kitchen burning water. She was wearing the sleeveless housedress that made her look like a bag lady.\n\u201cHello dear,\u201d she said. \u201cPlaying your game?\u201d\n\u201cYep. We won a match.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, Janis says that the government is holding social security this month.\u201d\n\u201cHmmm.\u201d\n\u201cSo we\u2019ll need the money, sweetheart.\u201d\n\u201cOK.\u201d I took a seat at the table and read the back of a cereal box.\nWin a free trip to the moon! it said. Send us 1,370,000 boxtops and we\u2019ll send you and a friend to Moonbase Alpha!!!!\n\u201cI wish you\u2019d bring some of your game friends to the house.\u201d\n\u201cMost of them live in China or Korea. Gaming is bigger there.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how you can let all those little robots into your brain.\u201d Mom took a bowl of green beans out of the microwave. \u201cIsn\u2019t it uncomfortable?\u201d\n\u201cMom, you don\u2019t feel the nanobots. I do get a little tingle when I cap and enter gamespace. No big deal.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about all that fighting? I watch your games on the screen. It looks like you get hurt.\u201d\n\u201cNah,\u201d I said. \u201cYou feel the blows, but even the bad ones are no worse than a slap.\u201d\n\u201cWell, better that fake fighting than the real thing. I\u2019m just glad you were never drafted, sweetheart.\u201d\n\u201cI was too fat to take.\u201d She knew that, of course, but I always felt this weird compulsion to say it aloud.\n\u201cMore of you to love,\u201d Mom said, and winked, which for no reason irritated me. She dished sausages onto a plate.\nWe repelled another raid, then two. We fought a larger neighboring encampment to a standstill, just on a wager.\nWe accepted two new members, a human archer named Ash and a gigantic carnivorous rabbit named Henry.\nFeeling safer and stronger and braver, we ventured out to the Bastinado Archipelago on a quest for a set of bronze pannikins that would fill with any liquid the owner requested, strictly to enhance our reputation.\nWe formed a party of six, including Nessos, and set out for the island of the owner of the pannikins, a wizard called Dingledoom.\nIn the fight up to the top of the wizard\u2019s tower, all of us were slain by orcs save Nessos.\nThe tale of his victory over Dingledoom became the stuff of gamespace legend.\nIn the center of Dingledoom\u2019s lair there sat a cast-iron caldron into which the wizard could look and see the future. Rather than fight the wizard and orcs head on, Nessos offered to allow the wizard to turn his brass body into a statue if the wizard looked into the caldron and saw the centaur beheaded. If he saw Nessos intact, Chancre Clan would get the tower.\nOh, oh, oh, said Dingledoom, a malevolent gleam in his eye. I get it. A paradox. If I see you headless, you win, and you respawn elsewhere and still get my tower. You\u2019ll probably cut your own head off, you yellow four-legged fiend. Well, I\u2019ll take that wager, centaur!\nWith a shout of triumph, the wizard cast his most powerful protection spell across the room and over Nessos, who crackled with supernatural glamour.\nHa, ha! cried the wizard. That spell is so strong, you can\u2019t even cut your own head off. Soon you\u2019ll sit outside my door, a doom-laden forewarning to any cretins who\u2019d dare steal from Dingledoom! Orcs, seize him, but harm not one hair on his yellow head!\nAs the pack of surviving orcs rushed into the lair, Dingledoom leaned eagerly over the caldron. Everyone watching the match saw a scarlet mist rise and we knew an image was forming. We saw the eyes of the wizard widen.\nNessos crouched backward on his hind legs and pushed off. He flew, magnificent, brass flanks shimmering, across the lair and over the caldron, so fast that the wizard hand\u2019t time to lift his eyes. Nessos\u2019s broadsword flashed out. The wizard\u2019s head, mouth agape and eyes alarmed, flopped off the neck and into the caldron\u2019s hellbroth.\nNessos landed on a cherrywood table littered with beakers and goblets, which he completely flattened. The pack of twenty orcs, green and grunting, circled him, but Nessos, cloaked by the wizard\u2019s protection spell, made short work of the lot of them; the audience only saw his sword rising and falling around a bubbling sea of helms and spearpoints.\nSoon, the wizard\u2019s lair was painted black with orc gore, limbs and torsos and ugly green heads gloriously scattered across the floor.\nNessos raised his own sword to his neck. The protection spell had been worn down from the orcs\u2019 blows and was now insufficient to protect Nessos from himself.\nHe whirled around, body curved, hooves at a gallop, and with one quick clanging stroke, he took his own head off. There was no blood; Nessos was fashioned of solid brass.\nAt that very moment Dingledoom stumbled back into the lair, having respawned (we later learned over ale) at the other side of the archipelago and flown as fast as his magic could carry him back to his tower.\nArgh! he cried out, seeing Nessos\u2019s brass head rolling on the ground. Ach!\nNessos wasn\u2019t there to enjoy the wizard\u2019s agony, having respawned at the other side of the continent. He\u2019d sacrificed himself, if only for a moment, for the good of the clan.\nAnd that\u2019s how Chancre Clan, having set out to steal a few magic cups, gained a wizard\u2019s tower and all its treasures.\nAnd we owed our victory to Nessos, the centaur in brass.\nIf some had doubted him, they wouldn\u2019t anymore.\n\u201cMom, we won a big match.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I know dear. I placed a bet on your little group.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! Oh mom, you\u2019re family. That\u2019s not legal.\u201d\nShe looked hurt, her lower lip sticking out. \u201cI placed the bet under Nancy\u2019s name.\u201d\n\u201cIf the gamemasters find out, I\u2019ll never make the next level!\u201d\n\u201cSweetie, you\u2019re twenty-five years old. Time to grow up. Everyone cheats once in a while.\u201d\nWe broke camp and moved the entire clan to the wizard\u2019s keep, re-dubbed Chancre Tower.\nIt turned out to be a damp, dim, and dirty residence, but we didn\u2019t care. Though the victory over Dingledoom had been a kind of mishap, it puffed us up and raised our sights.\nMore creatures came from across the continent, coming at a rate of one a day on coracles and rowboats, petitioning for membership.\nWe started getting choosy.\nDid everyone see the write-up in the Sing Tao Hourly?\nNo! Send me the link.\nWe made the bottom of the games page. The headline is: Underdogs no more! Chancre Clan comes out of nowhere to beat Dingledoom.\nI see Jin and Kian get quoted.\nVery cool.\nIn no time we were planning a raid on a sandstone castle in Hruba Skala, where, it was rumored, a baldanders kept a magical book that Columbine Clan needed to complete a quest.\nWe\u2019d get the book and sell it to Columbine Clan, who said they\u2019d swap it for a team of fighting pachyderms they\u2019d won in a parlay.\nWe fancied we\u2019d need a team of fighting pachyderms, though we didn\u2019t give much thought as to how we\u2019d feed them on a desolate islet, or even get them over the water.\nWe met on the black pebbly beach, since there was no space in the tower large enough to accommodate us all at once.\nWhat\u2019s a baldanders? asked Ash, leaning on his bow.\nA monster whose name means \u2018suddenly different,\u2019 or somesuch, replied Oropher. You never know what form a baldanders may take. Have any among us encountered a baldanders?\nNone had.\nI deem this a job for a team of two thieves, said Oropher, who always favored stealth.\nNay! Turl said. The goblin tells us that a spell protects the castle from thievery. If we know nothing of a baldanders, we should go in strength, and take its castle by force of arms!\nWhy can\u2019t Columbine get the scroll themselves? asked Nessos.\nOropher smiled. They tried already and they were beaten, he said.\nIf we could win this island, Nessos said, we can win a mere book.\nWe debated and in the end agreed we could do better than Columbine Clan, which had a reputation for choking in the breech. As night fell we haggled and planned and drew straws.\nThe next morning, thirteen of us set out to cross the gamespace to Hruba Skala.\nOn the way our little band was ambushed once in Brownhills by brigands and once on Mount Fasnacht by the dragon Winifred, but we slew all the brigands and we bought off the dreaded Winifred with a lindy hop performed by Turl and Cray.\nThat was humiliating. I can hear the gamemasters laughing at us.\nYou can\u2019t beat a dragon.\nNot with what we\u2019ve got.\nGet yer gamefaces on. Here comes the rock city.\nThe castle was carved from one of the sandstone columns, taller than Chancre tower. It appeared to be abandoned, the windowless holes dim and lifeless, the crenellated peak empty of guards. The cold wind blew and leaves swirled around our legs.\nWe smelled something burning, far away.\nLet\u2019s charge it, said Cray, waving Turl\u2019s dirk.\nOropher scratched his delicate chin. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure that I like the looks of this.\nOropher, you must be bold, said Nessos.\nWe\u2019d noticed Nessos testing Oropher is niggling ways; many of us had guessed that Nessos would soon challenge Oropher for leadership of the clan.\nYou go first, said Oropher. Come back and tell us what glamour guards this castle.\nNessos snorted and rode up to the oak door at the base of the castle. He drew his broadsword and used the pommel to knock heavily at the door.\nWe waited.\nNo answer, said Cray. No magic.\nNot yet, said Oropher.\nNessos swung the unlocked door wide, and was the first to step in.\nYou two stay outside, Oropher said to Pythy and Panpipe. When we reach the roof, we\u2019ll fire an arrow into the air. When you see that, come up. In the meantime, keep watch and stay alert.\nThe rest of us followed Nessos, swords drawn. We filed into a stone-walled anteroom draped in rotting tapestries, with sticks of furniture scattered across the stone floor.\nA black spider sat in the corner, spinning a silver web.\nCray prodded the spider with the dirk; the spider skittered to the center of the web.\nSpider, he said, does a baldanders live here?\nA baldanders? squeeked the spider. What\u2019s a baldanders?\nDon\u2019t play with me, arachnid. Cray wiggled the tip of the dirk.\nDon\u2019t hurt me! cried the spider. I\u2019m just a little spider.\nOropher slapped Cray\u2019s shoulder. The spider can\u2019t help, he said.\nIf there\u2019s no baldanders here, said Cray, this insect should know!\nHe snatched at the spider and caught her in his hand.\nOuch! he cried, hand flying open. The spider flipped to the floor and scampered into the folds of tapestry. That little beasty bit me!\nServes you right, Oropher said. Nessos, you\u2019re still on point. Why don\u2019t you climb the stairs?\nGladly, said Nessos. He trotted to the steps, carved from the very stone. The rest of us followed.\nOropher released a will-o-the-wisp from one of Dingledoom\u2019s scrolls, and it cast a soft green light up the stairwell.\nI don\u2019t feel so good, Cray said.\nYou can be in the middle, Oropher said. I\u2019ll take up the rear.\nWe fell in single file and Cray took a place between Golub and Henry.\nThe stairwell was steep, dark, and twisty; moment to moment we could see only the comrade on either side.\nThe stone glowed green in the light of the wisp and our faces took on the pallor of frogs\u2019 bellies.\nI don\u2019t like this, Cray said in the darkness.\nYou were only too ready to charge in a moment ago, said Golub, whose glowing plate-sized emerald eyes could see in the dark.\nI don\u2019t feel \u2026 hey! Golub, you\u2019re turning into an orc \u2026 Golub\u2019s gone! Watch out!\nCray, what are you \u2026\nWe heard a sword slash chain mail and suddenly Golub cried out and gurgled. He fell backwards into Ash.\nAnother orc, another orc! shouted Cray. He put one foot on Golub\u2019s stomach and pulled the dirk out of the dead creature\u2019s chest; with his free hand he drew his sword.\nCray, stop! cried Oropher, pushing his way up the stairs.\nAsh raised his bow to deflect Cray\u2019s blade, but Cray split the bow in two and drove his sword into Ash\u2019s throat, both his hands pushing on the pommel.\nAs Ash slumped to the wall, Cray straightened and gasped. Blood flowed from his mouth. He tumbled on top of Ash, a dagger in his back.\nHenry stood over the bodies, his pink ears drooping in the green light.\nAnd our will-o-the-wisp flared, and blew out.\nWhat the fuck?\nI swear my gameface saw them turn into orcs.\nDude. What the fuck?\nThe spider\u2019s bite must\u2019ve done something to him. Released a virus that affected his gameface perception.\nThat\u2019s new.\nYou shouldn\u2019t have been messing with that spider thing. Isn\u2019t the baldanders a shape-shifter? The spider could have been the baldanders.\nI thought a spell had teleported them out and put orcs in. I saw that happen once.\nYou sure shouldn\u2019t have just started stabbing.\nLook, I didn\u2019t know. Maybe I panicked a little.\nWell, I don\u2019t know if you should come back to the clan.\nHey \u2026\nAnyone know why Nessos never calls in?\nPut your guard up, guys. We\u2019re in another room.\nMom knocked on my door. I chinned out of the call and turned the wajang down low. The darkness of the stairwell lifted to reveal my bedroom.\n\u201cCome in,\u201d I said.\nMom walked in, wearing the pink housedress.\n\u201cSweetie, I thought I should let you know.\u201d\n\u201cKnow what?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I put a lot of money on this match.\u201d\n\u201cMom!\u201d\n\u201cYour group is doing so well.\u201d\n\u201cJeez, mom. Jeez.\u201d\n\u201cJust try not to lose, OK, sweetie? We need the money.\u201d\nGrab the hand of the man in front of you! shouted Oropher. Keep your weapons ready and keep walking. When we get to the next room, I\u2019ll spark a torch.\nWe ascended in total darkness. The steps ended; the floor leveled and we felt a breeze and we heard our footfalls echo.\nI\u2019m lighting a torch, said Oropher.\nWe saw a spark, two, a short torch flared. Two torches.\nAnd each of us was suddenly two.\nOropher stood beside his double, which held a second torch. Each of the rest of us \u2014 Pliny and Henry, Flay and Krake, Harald and Rebus \u2014 faced his twin.\nHenry confronted a second carnivorous rabbit, its left fang nicked in the same place; Pliny faced another dwarf who raised his axe at the instant Pliny raised his.\nThey\u2019re Fetches! cried one of the two Krakes.\nWhat\u2019s a Fetch?\nIt\u2019s a Scottish legend. A double who comes to fetch men to their death \u2026\nAnd women.\nI fought one once on Mount Fasnacht.\nI know which one I am, but I can\u2019t figure out which is which for the rest of you.\nWe\u2019ve got no choice. Kill the Fetch before he kills you.\nWhen the hacking and slashing and stabbing had ended, the stone floor was slippery with gore and littered with limbs.\nOropher\u2019s torch lay flickering on the ground near Henry\u2019s right arm, and the matted fur started to smolder.\nNessos still stood, and so did Oropher. The rest were dead.\nHow do I know you\u2019re not the Fetch? Nessos said to Oropher.\nYou don\u2019t.\nWe understand each other, Nessos said. He picked up the hem of Krake\u2019s cloak with the tip of his sword, grabbed it with his other hand, and proceeded to wipe the blade clean.\nOropher\u2019s for real \u2014 I\u2019m him \u2014 but I don\u2019t know about Nessos.\nHow come this Arnold person who is registered as Nessos never calls in?\nCan we hack the gamesystem and get a number?\nI\u2019m on it.\nLet\u2019s see if we can\u2019t get Philip Arnold on the call. Then we can find out if Nessos is real.\nThere\u2019s heavy betting. People are watching us.\nToo bad we look like idiots.\nOropher and Nessos started again up the stairs, led by the torch.\nThey crossed two more rooms. One was filled with more rotting furniture and tapestries; the second was an armory of doubtful usefulness.\nBack in the stairwell, light grew and shadows formed and sharpened, and soon the two stepped out onto a garden on the top of the castle.\nThe ground was covered with a layer of thick, black dirt, from which grew foul-smelling plants, some white, some black. The plants thickened and clustered around a statue that stood in the middle of the courtyard, carved from rain-worn sandstone.\nIt had the head of a satyr, the torso of a man, the wings of an eagle, and the tail of a fish. A stone book grew directly from its hand.\nFrom a barely perceptible belt hung a sword. It stood on a mound of masks carved from sandstone, each of the faces individual.\nMost of the faces appeared to be terrified.\nThough the space was, like the other rooms they had visited, only as wide as six men laid end to end, the walls reached just as high.\nA gangway built of wooden staves ran around the wall near the top, with crenels carved into the walls.\nThese are mandrakes, Oropher said, peering at a black-leafed plant. Crush them and they start screaming. The scream drives you mad.\nPerhaps the book is kept in the room we left, Nessos said.\nWe need assistance, Oropher said. He pulled his bow off his shoulder and drew an arrow. I\u2019ll call the griffins.\nHe released the arrow over the wall and into the air. They waited.\nNo one comes, Nessos said.\nOropher shot another arrow.\nThe wind blew keenly through the crenels, as if the castle were a giant whistling through his teeth.\nOropher crossed the courtyard and started to climb the mound of masks. The statue holds a book, he said. It\u2019s stone, but maybe it\u2019s the one we\u2019re looking for \u2026\nHe laid his hand on the brown skirt of the statue.\nThere was a groaning, which came from deep inside the stone.\nThe horned head of the statue moved and looked down; its hand went to the sword at its side.\nOropher tumbled back down the mound into a plot of mandrakes. The leaves of the plants shivered and screeched.\nWe have a problem.\nNo shit we have a problem.\nI know who Nessos is.\nNo shit. Who is he?\nShe. I traced Philip Arnold to someone named Kirsty Takahashi. I have an address.\nLet\u2019s send her an email.\nWell, here\u2019s the problem. Kirsty T. is also registered under the alias John Slack. John Slack is the registration name for the baldanders that we\u2019re fighting.\nOh, man.\nIt gets worse. Kirsty T. is registered in her own name as one of the bettors on this match.\nI don\u2019t even want to know who she put her money on.\nNo, you don\u2019t.\nSomebody tell the gamemasters \u2026\nThe baldanders \u2014 for now we knew, this was the creature that guarded the book \u2014 drew the sword from its stone scabbard, the blade gleaming with sinister glamour.\nWith the sound of stone breaking, its feet \u2014 one a goat\u2019s foot and one a vulture\u2019s claw \u2014 left the mound of masks, and the baldanders advanced on Oropher, who thrashed among the screaming mandrakes.\nOropher clapped his graceful hands to his ears and turned his face to the baldanders, who descended like a landslide.\nNessos galloped across the courtyard, sword held high, and he dashed up the pile of masks, flakes of sandstone flying away from his hooves. He reached the baldanders just as it stepped into the mandrakes, crushing one flat. The pitch of the screaming rose. Oropher dropped his hands, teeth clenched, and plucked one of Dingledoom\u2019s scrolls from his belt. He started to read the spell and glamour gathered around him like smoke.\nNessos rammed the baldanders head on, heedless; his blade snapped into three pieces against the sandstone.\nHe rebounded away and into the mandrakes, falling on top of Oropher.\nNow Oropher screamed, his mouth a knife wound, the scroll flipping into dirt, but the mandrakes drowned out his voice.\nThe blade of the baldanders sheared the air and cut flesh and brass with a single stroke.\nThat\u2019s it. Match over.\nThat was a nightmare.\nWe killed each other. What a bunch of idiots.\nWhere\u2019d everybody respawn? Let\u2019s get the rest of the clan and go back.\nLook, you know, I think I\u2019m going to take a break.\nMe, too.\nI might try to find another clan.\nHey, don\u2019t do that. We were good.\nNo, we weren\u2019t.\nWe had fun.\nSome. But we didn\u2019t make much money. I need to make money.\nGuys \u2026\nI stripped off the glasses and uncapped. I looked at my hands.\nShit.\nI turned them around and laid them down on the wajang. It was a white dome, no wider than a plate, with three cables and a wire snaking out, the EEG skullcap lying where I had placed it.\nUgly on the outside, pretty on the inside. I lived half my life inside.\nOutside it was night. Rain clattered against the window. I wondered what was in that damn book that the baldanders carried. Maybe it was a probability-generating AI like Dingledoom\u2019s caldron, which told the entire story of the game, from its very beginning to the very end, when the players were all uncapped and the servers were shut off.\nAnyone who had that book would know the future of gamespace: who to rob, what to say, where to go. They\u2019d make a killing in meatspace. They\u2019d be richer than Gates.\nI stood up and stretched. My back was killing me from sitting for so long.\nI heard the telltale floorboard creak outside my door.\n\u201cYou can come in, Mom,\u201d I said.\nThe door opened. I could see her hand on the doorknob but the arm disappeared into the shadow of the hall.\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI\u2019m \u2026 I\u2019m not sure what we\u2019re going to do, sweetie.\u201d Her voice seemed heavy.\n\u201cI think the clan is breaking up.\u201d\n\u201cWhat will we do?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll probably buy a new gameface, maybe a human this time, and he\u2019ll enter some tournaments. That\u2019ll make me a little bit of yuan.\u201d\n\u201cNo, honey. What are we going to do? I needed you to keep winning.\u201d\n\u201cDid you lose a lot of money?\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t answer and raindrops slapped the window. Then the door opened and she shuffled in.\n\u201cMaybe you should look for a real job \u2026 \u201d she said, not looking at me.\nI felt smaller. A lot smaller.\n\u201cGaming is a real job!\u201d I shouted, and we both jumped, both scared.\nI stood up and grabbed my coat from the bed. I turned to the desk, got my glasses, and put them on.\nI felt the tingle and my icons popped up in front of me. \u201cI\u2019m going out. Don\u2019t wait up.\u201d\nOutside on the stoop it was cold as well as raining.\nI zipped up the coat and stepped onto the sidewalk. All the houses were dark; only about half of them were inhabited. Our neighbors had been moving away for years, even before the war.\nI still got emails from Jorge, who\u2019d moved to Vancouver. He had a good job as a bioprogrammer. He had friends and a girlfriend.\nI walked down Cortland to the Mission Canal and waited for the vaporetto. In the shelter I studied a Sony Wajang ad, with a picture of Kai Wing giving the thumbs up and saying, When I play, I play Sony. Wing was a top-level player in a game called Star Destroyer.\nI\u2019d never played it, but I did see a couple of his matches. How much did Wing make for an ad like that? I looked it up on my glasses. Two million. What would I do with two million? Move to Canada, probably. Hang out with Jorge.\nAcross the canal I saw a squad of Korean peacekeepers, their blue helmets and slickers gleaming in the rain.\nThey smoked and didn\u2019t talk to each other, not seeming to care how wet they got.\nI took the vaporetto into the Mission and transferred at the 24th St. Pier to the forty-eight bus.\nWe groaned up to Twin Peaks, past the game bangs, with hapa teenagers smoking outside, and the dim bars and pawn shops.\nWhen we crossed Castro the shops and restaurants brightened; there were more people on the streets and no peacekeepers.\nI saw one bombed out Victorian, probably hit by a mortar, but otherwise all was intact.\nI got off on Grandview and found that the rain had stopped. It was bright and clear, the way it can be after rain, when the moon is full.\nIn the space between two houses I could see the canals of San Francisco stained by streetlights and the island neighborhoods sitting like shipwrecks on the water. I could even spot the ruins of the Bay Bridge and I remembered Sundays when I was a kid, when we went to Fruitvale for brunch at Aunt Katie\u2019s place.\nI checked my glasses for the address Jin had found in the gamemaster system, and slowly walked up the wet street, peering through the dark at the numbers on the houses. I quickly found it, huge and white.\nA single window on the second floor was lit yellow; the rest of the windows were dark.\nI looked around. It was a rich person\u2019s neighborhood \u2014 no one lived in a cooperative here \u2014 but even so, a quarter of the houses looked abandoned. I noted that the house directly across the street was one of the empty ones, its windows boarded up, weeds growing in the narrow lawn. There was no one else on the street.\nTrying to look casual, I walked across the Takahashi lawn and around the back of the house. No light snapped on, no alarm went off. In the back yard I found a rock garden, with a few short, twisted trees, two benches, and a patio set. I walked up to the sliding glass doors and peered into the living room.\nAll the furniture was as white as the house and covered with plastic, with an ancient plasma screen filling up half a wall. I tried the door; it was locked, of course.\nAs I walked back over the rocks, now less careful, I saw a garden gnome sitting under one of the short trees.\nI detoured and picked it up and tucked it under my arm. I left the yard and walked down the street back towards the bus.\nI admit it: I started watching the house.\nThe Takahashi family consisted of a handsome middle-aged Japanese guy, a slutty looking blonde, and their hapa daughter, whom I pegged as Kirsty.\nShe was slim, eighteen or nineteen, with bright eyes and dark hair. I once caught her in the window of her bedroom in her bra, for about twenty seconds before she drew the blinds.\nI recorded the image in my glasses. That kept me going for days. Sometimes, it still does.\nKirsty didn\u2019t go to school and didn\u2019t go to a job. She spent most of her time in the house, venturing out to meet friends in the Castro and on 24th St., where they did lunch and shopped.\nAll of her friends looked just like her: Hapa, pretty, slim, rich, with expensive AI glasses.\nI followed her every day for a week.\nOn the last day I followed Kirsty to a bookstore on the Market canal. When she went inside, I sat on a bench in front of a cafe half a block away. I bought a bagel and fed most of it to the ducks that gathered on the banks of the canal and left white duckshit all over the parapet.\nThe sky was the color of slate. Vaporettos chugged by, people leaning on the rails. I watched part of a Swords of Blakmar match on my glasses.\nAfter a half hour I realized that Kirsty hadn\u2019t come out. I admit I was a little bit concerned; I had been watching her so much that I\u2019d started to feel protective of Kirsty. I turned off the glasses, threw the rest of the bagel to the ducks and went inside.\nI strolled between the shelves, stopping to browse the science-fiction section; I picked up the 45th book of the Wheel of Time series, which had just come out. I kept moving to the rear of the store, keeping one eye on the entrance.\nI got to the back and turned around.\nWhen I rounded the corner into the self-help section, I almost walked over Kirsty, who was crouching on the floor. She yelped and jumped up; I stumbled back a few steps.\n\u201cWhy are you following me?\u201d she said, looking straight at me, fists clenched at her hips.\n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m not \u2026 \u201d I said, not able to meet her eyes.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been following me. I want to know why.\u201d\n\u201cI, uh, do you play Swords of Blakmar?\u201d I said. I thought: way to go, jerk.\n\u201cWhat? What did you say?\u201d\n\u201cYou know, the game. Swords of Blakmar? I play in the lower levels, but I\u2019m working my way up. You might have heard of my clan \u2026 we got a write-up in Sing Tao \u2026 \u201c\n\u201cDo you even know how creepy you are?\u201d Her voice shook and rose. \u201cDo you?\u201d\nI could feel the other customers looking at us. I felt really hot.\n\u201cListen, I just want to ask you \u2026 \u201d I raised my hand.\n\u201cDon\u2019t fucking touch me!\u201d she screamed.\nNow I saw a clerk coming down the aisle behind her.\n\u201cI\u2019m not \u2026 hey, at least I\u2019m honest, I don\u2019t cheat \u2026 \u201d I said.\n\u201cAre you OK?\u201d The clerk asked Kirsty, standing just behind her.\nShe blinked at him, but didn\u2019t respond.\nThe three of us stood there, Kirsty lowering her eyes to the floor.\nThen she looked up again and she didn\u2019t look angry or afraid.\n\u201cI got banned, you know,\u201d she said to me. \u201cFrom the game.\u201d\n\u201cYou broke the rules,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd our clan really tried. We were doing really good.\u201d\nThe clerk shrugged and walked back up the aisle.\n\u201cOnly because of me,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you know how hard I worked to build that gameface?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d I admitted. \u201cThe centaur was cool. The baldanders might have been even cooler. It was really scary.\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\nShe seemed almost shy as she said this, turning her eyes to the shelf, picking at a book.\n\u201cYou were good at the game. You could have made plenty of money without cheating. Why didn\u2019t you just fight your way through the levels like everyone else?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m not like everyone else,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m better.\u201d\nShe turned and walked away.\nIt made me mad, the way she just walked away.\n\u201cI stole the gnome out of your garden!\u201d I bawled at her back. \u201cI gave it to my mom.\u201d\n\u201cYou keep it,\u201d she said, turning her head in profile. \u201cI hated that creepy thing. Besides, it looks like you.\u201d\nThings got bad after that, I guess.\nI was too discouraged to game for money \u2014 you could say I was depressed \u2014 and the government stopped sending social security checks.\nWithin a year, mom and I lost our house.\nWe spent a few scary nights sleeping on the banks of the Market canal, me hugging the wajang close under a wool blanket, until the city assigned us temporary housing in the Mission.\nI applied for a job-training gameface, and they gave me one.\nPretty soon I was interning for the water department gamespace in risk management, helping figure out all the horrible shit that could go wrong in the city: earthquakes, flood, terrorist attacks, another invasion, thieves, a thousand different kinds of breakdowns.\nI imagined each threat as a brass centaur, and I never dropped my guard.\nYou know what? I turned out to be good at the job. I got promoted from intern to assistant; a year after that, I was running my own risk scenarios in the municipal gamespace.\nThe pay was fine, and we were able to join a cooperative apartment complex on Corona Island, and Mom got so involved with the neighbors that she mostly left me alone.\nWhen my risk unit came up with a proposal for neighborhood aquaponic greenhouses as a solution to the city\u2019s water and food distribution problems, the department assigned me to launch a meatspace pilot project on Corona.\nPretty soon I was spending only half the day in the municipal gamespace; most of the time I was working with neighbors to build the greenhouse.\nI learned how to use a hammer and screwdriver; I lost weight.\nThe first time we ate fish from the greenhouse tank in the coop kitchen, I looked around at my neighbors and realized that maybe I was helping make things a little bit better.\nWhich was weird.\nI never went back to playing Swords of Blakmar. But sometimes I\u2019d dream I was Oropher.\nI was Oropher but I wasn\u2019t in the gamespace; I was here at home on Corona, but bearing a shield and carrying a sword, brave and strange.\nI did see Kirsty one more time, five years after the Nessos debacle.\nI was at Dolores Park with my mom. It was sunny and dry, for once, and we spread a blanket out on the grass in front of the lake and ate pickles and sandwiches.\nMom wore her bright flower-print housedress and a straw hat. After lunch she lay down and fell asleep spread-eagled.\nI finished the new Dune novel I was reading on my glasses (Sandfleas of Dune, which in my opinion wasn\u2019t as good as the last one) and got up to pee.\nAs I walked back to our spot I saw her, sitting on the bench at the top of the ridge that forms the southwest corner of the park.\nKirsty wore white shorts and a yellow T-shirt, pretty as she had been five years before, and she was looking at something far away, shielding her eyes with both hands.\nShe was incandescent with sunlight, sitting perfectly still, and of course I thought of the centaur and imagined Kirsty as a solid brass monument to herself.\nAt that moment I wanted so badly to see Nessos step into the muddy park, kicking up tufts of dirt and grass, sword drawn and gleaming in the sun.\nThe sunbathers would scream and scatter like the orcs and trolls they really are, scared and suspicious, and Nessos would rear and gallop and sweep through the park like a cold wind and cut them down with his sword and the grass would turn black with blood.\nIt\u2019d be awful to see and I wanted to see it so badly.\nWhy shouldn\u2019t something so beautiful and magical have the right to do anything it wanted?","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

They drive here in Lincolns and Cadillacs so the wives, the children, the grandchildren can spend the summer at the country club while the husbands fly back and forth weekends.\nMostly they come to me when they can\u2019t find a spouse or a child. Usually I can find them. Sometimes I find them in circumstances that the client doesn\u2019t like. Sometimes they need what I bill as special services.\nIt was early morning, or early for me, and I looked out the window of my office at the La Jolla Cove where the air is clearer than clear, the water bluer than blue, and the seals play in the surf. I used to have a bare bones office with a desk, two chairs and a view of a wall. I provided a special service for the guy who owns the building and now I get to enjoy the cove, furniture you can spend the night on, all the amenities.\nMy head ached from the night before, and I went into my little kitchen. In the morning I like a bloody Mary and a boiled egg. My suit was not rumpled. I pay extra for suits that don\u2019t rumple.\nI heard jingling at the door, and a figure loomed dark grey in the frosted glass. I pressed the buzzer. An old woman walked in. She had Dallas written all over her: blue hair and a blue-grey Shantung suit. She had rings on most fingers, real diamonds, and the jangling I had heard were her bracelets and earrings.\nShe walked past my leather comfort-the-client chair and with surprising agility parked her hip on the corner of my desk exposing skinny legs in silk stockings and one foot with a piercing heel.\n\u201cI understand you can find people around here,\u201d she said. Her voice was oleaginous with mature petro-dollars.\nI watched her. She reached into her purse, took out a gold vape and ignited it.\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d I said, \u201cif the price is right.\u201d\n\u201cMy granddaughter Mildred is missing. She\u2019s been gone a week.\u201d Again with the purse, she brought out a photograph with colors more vivid than life. The girl looked like she was in her late teens. She wore tennis shorts, a peasant blouse, and stood on a tennis court with a racket in her left hand. She was tall, maybe as tall as I am. Nice legs. She looked into the camera with defiance masked as sullenness.\n\u201cHave you called the cops?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t have talk back home.\u201d\n\u201cI understand,\u201d I said. I asked her the usual questions about where she had last been seen \u2014 at the club on her way to the beach.\nI asked about boyfriends. Her grandmother denied them.\nEnemies? Well she was outspoken, but grandmother didn\u2019t think her kid had really offended anyone.\nWho were her friends? They were all from Dallas at the country club. Questions like that. I told her my hourly rate and specified a high retainer. She reached into the purse and plunked C-notes on my desk.\n\u201cThere\u2019s one more thing,\u201d she said. For the first time uncertainty diluted her arrogance. \u201cYou know Emma Parker?\u201d\nI remembered Parker. She had required special services. But I never divulge names.\n\u201cShe says she was a client of yours.\u201d\nI held my quiet face, not that my face is ever cuddly. I had told Parker to keep her mouth shut.\nShe leaned toward me and asked, \u201cHave you turned to stone?\u201d\nI shrugged.\n\u201cWell, if it should be necessary, I can pay for that too.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll bet you can.\u201d\nI left my Glock in the safe and drove to the club in the afternoon. It\u2019s up on a rise a few blocks from the beach \u2014 apartments with hotel accommodations dressed up as a Spanish mission dropped in the middle of a golf course, plus swimming pools, tennis courts, lawn bowling, you name it. A shuttle runs a few blocks to the beach.\nNone of the guests acknowledged me, but some of the staff did. I learned that Mimi, that was her name for Mildred, had told friends that she was going to the beach, but the shuttle driver knew her and said she had not used it.\nI was beginning to think it was an inside job, but two of her friends told me she had had a couple of dates with a guy on a motorcycle. I asked what kind. They said Harley. I asked them if she knew where they\u2019d gone, but she\u2019d been tight-lipped with them.\n\u201cYou know, she can be a bitch,\u201d one of her friends said.\nLa Jolla is not exactly a hot date town. First place I checked after I talked to her friends at the club was one of our several Italian restaurants, but it was a dead end. I won\u2019t recite all the places I visited \u2014sleazy on the outside and luxurious within or vice versa. I talked to women who were attracted to me, or pretended to be, or pretended not to be. You\u2019ve heard all that stuff; you know how it goes. It\u2019s hard, boring work.\nIt led me to the house of an old special-services client of mine named Enzo Gonsolvo. I packed my Glock.\nGonsolvo now lives in a ranch-style house in the hills with a distant view of the sea, an elaborate newly landscaped front yard, and a three-car garage full of motorcycles. Mostly Harleys. He was the past president of a 1% bikers club called the Mongols.\nThe Mongols have a system like Deng Xiaoping set up in China. After a few years, the president retires and the vice president becomes president. The president moves somewhere and lives in straight comfort with his family but still wields a lot of influence.\nGonzalo and I had met before. The Mongols were having drug turf wars with the Outlaws and people had died.\nI showed him the picture of Mimi and told him what I picked up about her and her movements. He was a plump man with crew-cut black hair and a Stalin mustache. He was wearing blue jeans and a red silk shirt. He put aside the picture.\n\u201cBeats me,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou owe me,\u201d I said. I could make out a hair-thin scar all across his neck.\nHe nodded. He unpocketed his phone, excused himself and went into another room. He knew I understood Spanish. He was gone for some time. I could hear the rhythm of his conversations but not the words. He made more than one call.\nHe came back carrying his phone. He held it out to me. There was a map with a red arrow pointing to a spot in the wild country in the eastern part of the county.\n\u201cSend it to me,\u201d I said. After some finger fumbling by each of us it appeared on the screen of my phone.\nI went to my car and spread the map. The red arrow tipped in Anza Borrego state park. Judging by the fineness of the grey lines on my screen, it would be four-wheel country. I drove my venerable Toyota to a rental agency and picked up a Jeep.\nIt\u2019s about a two-hour drive. I took I-8 to Ocotillo, where I stopped for a drink in the Lazy Lizard saloon, and then State Route 52, San Diego\u2019s loneliest highway, north. I was in no hurry and stopped at the Carrizo Badlands Overlook.\nIt was late afternoon by the time I got there, and the sun from the west accented the drama of the treeless plateaus and gorges. Before I reached the town of Borrego Springs, Siri talked me off the highway onto a well-maintained gravel road, then a not-so-well maintained road, then a rough branch where I appreciated the power steering. Then the nearest microwave tower lost me.\nThe road, if you could call it that, ended dead. I got out and examined the gulches. The car door banged loud in the vast silence. Soon I saw her, lying against some boulders halfway down a jagged slope. She was wrapped in white linen. I wished I had gotten hiking shoes along with the Jeep.\nI half-climbed, half-crawled to her and pulled the linen aside. She was in blue jeans and a flannel blouse. Her feet were bare. Her arms looked bruised from rolling down the slope, but she\u2019d been dead when they tossed her. A small bullet wound marred her forehead.\nShe\u2019d been shot from the front with a small-caliber weapon at a range farther than close.\nI shifted to a secure position and lay my hand on her forehead. I could feel the hole and its rough edges. I closed my eyes and concentrated on being there. It was a great place to do that, still and indifferent. The wound was diminishing under my fingers. When I looked, only a star of tiny lines, barely visible in the fading light, remained.\nThe sky to the west was brilliant blue, but in the purple east stars were beginning to make themselves known. I bent and kissed her, not a passionate kiss, not a mere touch \u2014 a comfortable kiss.\nShe began to move. She opened her eyes and jerked uncomfortably on the rough slope. She gave me a look both incredulous and sullen.\n\u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d she said.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

I couldn\u2019t remember ever cutting or scratching myself.\nI should have known something was off when I saw a small green hair sprouting from it. And I should have become worried when that green hair grew two distinct leaves that were the shape of the maple trees of my youth.\nI should have, but I didn\u2019t.\nI didn\u2019t because I don\u2019t really like my body all that much, so I don\u2019t really pay attention to it. I even shower with my t-shirt and boxers on, and I dress in my windowless bathroom with the lights off.\nI\u2019m not sure how I grew to despise my body so much. Blaming my thrice-broken nose seems like a cop out.\nYes, I was a scrawny kid who got beat up regularly in the boy\u2019s locker room during those brutal junior high years. Mostly because I was the smallest boy. Sometimes because I was staring at the other boy\u2019s pricks, especially the uncut ones that looked so funny.\nBesides, I went to therapy all through high school. The school counselor mandated it after I broke one of the bully\u2019s tailbone. Somehow, the bullies didn\u2019t get mandated therapy. Only me.\n\u201cThat\u2019s just typical junior high behavior,\u201d is what the counselor said. \u201cI\u2019m worried about your anger issues.\u201d\nBut like I said, I don\u2019t think that is why I hate my body so much. I had therapy. I also don\u2019t think it stems from my college years, during which I came out.\nThere was an incident at the public university I frequented. I frequented it because my Catholic college wasn\u2019t all that supportive. In fact, I was sat down by my academic advisor there and told my being out is \u201ccausing a disturbance.\u201d\nThe incident happened in a bathroom at the public university. A burly man who looked an awful lot like one of the priests at my Catholic college was lingering at the urinal. I was lingering too, and I happened to linger a little too long on his erect penis. He grabbed me and threw me into the toilet stall. He kept whispering \u201cfaggot\u201d as he tore off my pants.\nThe next day, my academic advisor called me and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think that you and this college are a match. We are requesting that you do not enroll here next semester.\u201d\nAgain, I went to therapy. This time, Christian counseling. There was a lot of talking about attractions and bodies and sins. Mostly, those conversations were brought up by the counselor. In fact, I don\u2019t think I have ever talked so much about the male body before or after those sessions.\nBut all that personal history doesn\u2019t really matter. I mean, I just don\u2019t like my body and I have learned how to cope with that reality: I don\u2019t own any mirrors; I sleep fully clothed; I don\u2019t have sex.\nAnd at least I am somewhat content with this life. Or at least I am not as depressed as I used to be.\nBut \u2026 I am avoiding the fact that something sprouted from my chest, from a scab I do not remember getting.\nI do remember a dream, though, that I had on the night of the summer solstice.\nI was in a forest, and it was midnight. The forest grew so thick I could not see the sky. I was naked (yes, it was one of those dreams), and I was urgently searching for my clothes. I dug holes in the earth with my bare hands, thinking I had buried them. I tore open trees believing that my clothes were hidden inside their trunks. I could not find my clothes, and in my panic, I tripped on the root of a maple tree, one that reminded me of the tree in the front yard of my childhood home.\nI fell for what seemed like years, and I never touched the ground. As I fell, I prayed not to God or to the heavens but to that childhood maple tree. I prayed I would finally find peace. Not the peace of world peace. Nor the peace of peace of mind. But the peace that comes from knowing who you are. The peace that comes from both acceptance and resignation.\nThe maple tree caught me, and in doing so its branches scratched my chest. (Or so I think.)\nI woke, bed wet from both perspiration and the release of fear. I went to my windowless bathroom to shower, kept the lights off, and it was only when I tried to take off my sopping t-shirt and boxers that I realized I was naked. It being pitch black, I could not see that the maple tree had left a physical mark.\nIt has been three weeks since my dream, and the scab and seedling still grow. I finally acknowledged it when the twig broke through my t-shirt and the scab covered my entire chest.\nBut scab is not the correct word. It is more like bark, and the twig is turning into a branch.\nIt has been five weeks since my dream, and I no longer wear any clothes.\nI also no longer leave my front yard. I cherish the feeling of sun and rain upon my leaves, of earth between my roots, of bugs burrowing in my bole, of birds raising their families in my boughs.\nToday, the house is no more. A child is making memories under my glorious canopy, collecting fallen twigs, bundling them together, and binding the bundle with twine.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

A knit cap with a white puffball perched at the top covers the tips of her ears. Rhythmic clicks of her stiletto boots against the concrete are in sync with the offbeat chorus of city noises, as though she is a repeated note in this evening song.\nEvery few centuries, one like her is born. An inversion of their nature, able to smile at the sun without turning to stone like her grandfathers\u2019 grandfathers, now known as the Trollveggen Mountains.\nHer own stature is slight in comparison. She did not inherit the face of her kin \u2014 mottled gray cheeks, mossy teeth and tangled-bramble hair. Her appearance mimics what these fragile humans call beauty, allowing her to walk among them as though she, too, has tendons spun like gossamers and dried leaf skin, drained of pigment and easily pierced, little hearts that hold only seven or eight fleeting decades of beats.\nBut it is only her visage that matches their weakness. Her grandmother lined the deepest fjords with sand made from boulders she ground between her teeth, and her mother tore whole pine trees into kindling with her bare hands to feed their hearth\u2019s fires.\nTheir strength stayed with her, a loving burn beneath her skin.\nThe man ahead of her holds the lobby door open. He has done this for her before, she recalls vaguely, always with the same grin that is too wide for his face. She folds her lips ever so slightly in response, and this crumb is enough for him to presume a feast.\nGood evening, he greets her. Terrible weather tonight, don\u2019t you think?\nShe doesn\u2019t reply. Humans are always fretting over the tiniest bit of rain or wind or snow, eager to keep their trembling bodies from being touched by anything other than the choicest moments of clear sky and breeze.\nDo you have plans this evening, he asks, or are you in for the night?\nWho can say, she replies, bemused as always by humans\u2019 adherence to invented schedules. What does the moon care who howls beneath her? Humans can roam freely without fear of being turned to stone, and they have so few breaths to enjoy, yet they categorize each one so solemnly.\nLike humans, she is embraced by the sun. Yet she naps at its peak and strolls down deserted roads in the sharpest point of its absence.\nToo late, she realizes the man\u2019s attempt at small talk has unfurled into something larger. He rests a hand on her arm, a touch light enough for politeness, but he digs his fingers into the fabric of her coat.\nI have a bottle of chardonnay in my fridge, he says. You\u2019re welcome to join me for a glass.\nHe attempts to pin her in place with a charming smile. Her human face, slipper shell ears and sharp chin and pink pebble nose, let her pass for something less than what she is. If she was his equal in frailty, he might succeed in bending her to his will. She isn\u2019t and he won\u2019t, but it irritates her all the same.\nShe swings his hand away from her body in one swift move, sliding her thumb over the eight little nubs of bone that make up his wrist. She could press a fraction firmer and make all eight of them crumble like clumps of dirt.\nNo, she says, the word falling like a hammer against his chest. His cheeks go pale as he meets her eyes. She widens them a hairsbreadth, mirrored surfaces that disguise their depths until the person mesmerized by their shine has leaned over too far to stop from tumbling in to drown.\nIt\u2019s a risk. After the eyes, he might spot the grace that floods her too-long stride, the way her hip curves in line with the earth, the moonbeams that peek out sleepily from her nailbeds. Mythic traits hung in a human frame. She is a magician, not a god; able to change perception but not nature.\nNo matter. Her thumb still strums his pulse. She can have him kneeling in a puddle of his own pain in half a second and disappear into some other brick and mortar city before he gasps for help from other humans in crisp little uniforms with their blustering questions and notepads filled with loopy runes. Her charm could convince them to excuse her, but why bother fighting to stay? There is nothing here she would miss. This apartment is not home; she hoards no treasures here.\nShe is always poised to start over, to outrun her last mistake.\nBut the man is averting his gaze and tremoring beneath her grip, which pity loosens, allowing him to step back to fade into the night. She walks through the empty lobby and up thirty flights of stairs to the top floor.\nThe climb does not wind her. As a child running alongside her larger cousins, she could scale six different mountains before breakfast, cartwheel a border of handprints along the jagged arctic coastline three times over before the breeze had time to whistle the grit smooth again.\nGo, her family had urged her, go out and see the world. We are bound by the sun, you are not. Your face will not be a target for japes and wounds the way ours are. We want better for you, my dear. Assimilate into the human world and learn their ways. Dance over the thinned forest edges that pin us back and see what curious things they spend their scant years doing, then come home and tell us all you\u2019ve learned.\nAnd so she had left her family\u2019s stone crevice to slip into mortal tents. Gold runs freer than water for her kind, tucked under the bark of spruce trunks and sunk into the silt of riverbeds, always enough to take her around the globe via nomadic trek and splintered wagon and wooden ship.\nShe saw twig fingers weave sails wide enough to black out the stars, wrinkled babes quieted by forehead kisses rimmed in beard bristle, new lovers bound and last pleas exhaled, coals sparked and throats slit. After she\u2019d bathed in the midnight sun at both ends of the Earth, she returned home with her mind stuffed full of stories she would pull out and share bites of at the dinner table.\nWhen she arrived at her family\u2019s mountain, the entrance rock was soaked in sunrays, hot to the touch. Ash trees that once shaded the cave\u2019s mouth were filed down to stumps. The light had crept through the doorway and seeped its way across the floor.\nShe passed upturned bowls and knocked-over chairs; dead monuments to panic. Porridge spilled from the bowls had long been eaten away by mice, and the chairs were draped in dust. Sunlight penetrated the deepest parts of the dwelling, and the farthest back wall was now Trollveggen in miniature. Crouched figures shading stone faces, stuck to the wall they\u2019d been herded against.\nHer scream shook the walls and ruptured a crack through the ear of her favorite aunt.\nOutside, a forgotten ax head was buried in one stump. She unsheathed it and hurled it into the sun. It melted into metal rain that pelted the settlement at the mountain\u2019s base. She clawed the mountain to rubble and sent it hurtling down in a landslide of curses to bury the ash-wood longhouses built from her family\u2019s defenses. Humans would pay, she swore, for all they\u2019d taken from her.\nBut rage was not quick enough to claim her. Grief stomped it out, leaving her numb, and she withdrew to what remained of her forests. She searched for other trolls and found only mountains doubling as gravestones.\nSo she stopped looking.\nHer pain is dulled enough that she can spend her time in the human world. These concrete rivers are not her home, but neither are the mountains, with her roots torn out and scattered. Her feet never stay planted for long, always drifting.\nSometimes she sits in the sun at high noon, eyes closed as she shuts out every sound except her heartbeat and waits for it to stop. She won\u2019t turn to stone, she knows. What was once a privilege is now a penance that reminds her of how dissimilar she always was, and always will be. She will never reunite with her family. Whatever sort of death she eventually has, it will be solitary. Even if some future day brings a sun that burns strong enough to petrify her, she will be a foothill at best, not a mountain.\nShe reaches the corridor at the top of the stairs. Her apartment is in the northeast corner. She lets herself in and locks the door behind her, shedding her coat and scarf and boots and puffball hat as she shakes out her hair. She prepares tea, spiked with sugar and dark wine.\nCurled up on the sofa, she takes a sip and imagines it echoes the skald mead brewed with blood and honey she drank as a child, though her tongue\u2019s memory is too weak to remember.\nOn the television, a news anchor with stiff hair and a stiff smile reports on a new construction site that broke ground today. A forest razed flat to accommodate another concrete brick filled with flitting human duties. She thinks nothing of it, until the camera pans out.\nA rock sits at the edge of the dead dirt, soft curves tilted up towards the sky in surprise. A troll, she identifies immediately. The thinned tree line must not have been enough to shield them from being petrified when the sun rose.\nShe hadn\u2019t been alone, after all.\nThat troll is no mountain, but a boulder only a few hands higher than herself. The construction site is located just a few miles to the west. Before the forest died, she might have walked through it on a whim one evening and spotted this unknown relation. She might have called out a greeting and embraced this long-lost cousin, brought them home for supper and swapped stories.\nBut she never did.\nThe empty mug lolls in the crease between the sofa cushions as she stands up. The mirror by the front door snags the corner of her gaze, and she bats her reflection out of her eye. She will hate what she sees, her mother\u2019s sad eyes trapped in a monstrous face. Human stories paint her kind as simple, easily fooled, but brutality is no trick. There is no ignorance in dying when your heart has been gouged out. It was not cleverness that allowed humans to strip away the lives of others.\nThey throw knives with clumsy hands; only chance has kept their aim true.\nShe peels off her clothes, flimsy slivers of cotton that flutter around her feet like dead leaves at the base of a tree. Naked, she rolls her shoulders and arches backwards, loosens her limbs and uncoils her tail, her lone familial feature. She lets it sway, a whip prepared to crack and draw blood with its tip that she will lick clean, bruising her lips with a mineral tang.\nShe swore to defend her hereditary honor. What happened? Maybe her human appearance soaked into her core, tainted her courage so she could see apathy as a virtue.\nHumans have no reverence for their world. They cannot grasp the fantastic parts of what is real. Even displaced, she holds these truths, whispered to her by her ancestors. She inhaled each word and they stitched themselves into the base of her throat. She breathes them back out now as she opens her window and crouches on the frozen edge.\nHer toes melt the ice and she gouges the brick with her fingernails. She leaps into the sleet, welcomed by the wind between her window and the sidewalk that will crack apart when she lands, unharmed.\nShe will not let any more pieces of herself be destroyed. She will find others like her, broken and lost. Together they will wield the past against those that battered it.\nShe will slice open a vein of the earth and pull out a handful of iron, heat it with her screams, forge the steel to a sharp edge and cool it with her tears, slice it through their threadbare bodies and then bend it, careless, into a knot, close her fist around the snarled blade and crush it into dust.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

A rare gem, Momma always said.\n\u201cHow was your first day?\u201d she asks, her tongue poking out like it did when she was focused. I wonder what color her polish is today.

I just gave it a go, and the ducks are following me down the road now. As they follow me, whenever I look back, the road is being filled with more and more ducks, though there were only two of them following me.\nIt was the distance traveled that seemed to create the multiplication, and the more curves I follow, the more slight hills I climb, and dips I ease down, the more of them there are, walking along behind us, quacking.\nIt is nice, and reminds me of my grandmother. She was a darling, and her eyes were like the ducks, and her voice when she spoke about wanting to pack me a cake with those carrots she put on top of them like forests, was something like a quack. We had ducks when I was young, and it is when I meet men who remind me of ducks, or my grandmother, that I feel safe. I feel I can perhaps love them, and let them touch me once I get to know them.\nThe ducks were my friends, and my grandmother was my friend, when my father and my uncle were not.\nWhen my father and my uncle would come home, they would turn into stovepipes, black, hollow, hard, impermeable, and on fire. I would bang on them, but become blacked by it. They would chase me, pounding their cylindrical selves along bang after bang over the floor, over the ground, even over the water, when I would swim to get away from them. They could float. They could even float into my tears and go into the tear ducts, cylindrical as they were, and go inside my body in ways I could never explain to anyone.\nThey would only come out when they were ready, and I never knew when that would be. Mostly, when it was time to eat. I would eat under the table, but the table legs were often on their side.\nThe table legs tended to start banging as well, vibrating, coming closer to me. I was an only child. I could fit easily under the table. But as I grew larger, and older, I would start sticking out from the table, and whenever I did, whatever was sticking out would be naked. I would try to pull back in under the table to hide, but something was always exposed, my skin so pale and soft. I tried to be as thin as possible, and I never wanted to eat anyway.\nBut I was happy to see the food arrive on the table, as it meant my uncle or my father would be hungry and leave my tear ducts. Once they left my tear ducts, they were no longer stove pipes.\nThe ducks were soft and our grandmother was soft, nothing like stovepipes at all. They loved me, and now, I make my lovers quack. I ask them to come fly down on my lap, and they will pretend to flap their wings, and waddle. It makes me safe. I pet them and fluff their feathers and run water for them in the living room to play in. The whole living room is water filled now, waiting for them. Sometimes we swim in it together.\nOne day, I came home and there was a duck that had fallen through the chimney, because the flue was left open. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Somehow, the two didn\u2019t go together. I carried the duck outside to the creek to let it go where it knew it was, where it could find the water. It grew in my arms as I walked, and the trail became longer. It was four hours before we got to the creek, and by that time, the duck was the size of a collie dog. I could barely carry it, and it looked at me with those duck eyes, being so patient, and I didn\u2019t really want to let it go. But I wanted it to be happy and free.\nWhen I got to the water\u2019s edge, I stooped down to put it down and it fell. It fell so hard that it bruised itself, and started bleeding, and I was horrified. I reached down to wipe the blood from its legs with my dress and it became angry, and flew up at my face, becoming larger, going right through my skin, right through my eyes. It was horrible. I never cried so hard even when my uncle was in my tear ducts and I was trying to wash him out. I turned my head to see it pass through my head, but when I did, it was going back the other way. Each time I turned my head to watch it go, it was going the other way. It flew back and forth through my head and I couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. I knew someone else would want to help me, so I called my grandmother.\nShe was there in a minute, though I had walked so far from the house. She was quick that way. She said the duck just wanted to be free, and I said that\u2019s what I wanted too. I wanted the duck to be free. She put out her hand to keep the duck from flying back the other way. But she put it out too soon, before the duck was all the way through.\nThat\u2019s when it became stuck in my head. That\u2019s why it is there. And that\u2019s why the ducks are following me. It\u2019s kind of nice. It reminds me of her, and my childhood. I know they are more interested in the duck sticking out of my head than in me. But I don\u2019t mind. Who else is going to follow me so devotedly that they multiply like that? And they quack more resonantly than my lovers I have to train. They come by it naturally. And I like that.\nTantra Bensko publishes her writing widely, in magazines such as The Journal of Experimental Fiction, Fiction International, Evergreen Review, Mad Hatters Review, Bewildering Stories, Rose and Thorn, Cezanne\u2019s Carrot, and many more.

At first the people were glad: \u201cWhat gentle weather!\u201d\nThen autumn\u2019s leaves rotted on the trees and in spring the buds were sparser for it. Flowers grew thin on the uncomposted ground.\nOne day, as they lay in the half-sun at her cave\u2019s entrance, he said, \u201cI will live up here, survive on birds and rats.\u201d\nThe breeze halted for an imperceptible second, began again with a little gasp.\nThat night all Biscay heard her mournful sighs \u2014 in chimneys, alleyways, the orange-tiled rooves of ancient farmhouses.\nThe sound made lovers clutch one another closer, crying for their own mortality and the separation death would one day bring.\nNext morning, before Iker came, Mari took her deepest breath. For hours she inhaled salt, mist, mulch, till the air hung still in the valley and wise folk said, \u201cA wind is waiting to blow.\u201d\nBefore his body smashed against the Lariz Tower, the people of San Miguel, Atxando, Durango, say they heard the young man laughing for joy as he flew on the wind.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

We can see down here; your kind cannot. Our commonality lies in the tendency to move towards the light, even though I can\u2019t handle much of it. If my people swim too far into brighter, warmer water, we risk ascension.\nIt\u2019s common knowledge where I live that there is, in the most essential way of thinking, no such thing as death. So I have no fear of dying. But I am afraid of the unknown, which very clearly rests in the heights of shallow water, up in your realm, where we\u2019ll someday be. Not for a long time if we\u2019re lucky. We offer each other blessings and good wishes along the lines of here\u2019s to many, many years in the water.\nBut if ascension is nothing to fear, even something to look forward to, why should I want to remain in the dark as long as possible? Questions like this make me want to be a scientist someday. We know little of your lives, beyond the surface; but I do know that you study the deep sea, possibly no longer knowing we exist, and that in some regard you\u2019re studying yourselves.\nWe met a long time ago, somewhere deep in our collective history. There\u2019s a lot we have in common, and going off the stone texts preserved in the trenches, even more that we do not. Cultural memory serves, but only in pieces. Our libraries, most located in the deepest recesses of the abyss, are ancient and full of stories. Among the tablets and formations littered with writing are stories of you, some from you. We\u2019re familiar with your religion. Sometimes we can\u2019t quite separate it from ours. We also can\u2019t quite tell if you\u2019re mortal or not. But we know for certain our paths crossed, in past millennia when we lived nearer to the surface.\nIt\u2019s impossible to say much else about you for certain, because you remain murky to us, and therefore constantly wondered after. Water erodes even stone with enough time. Our libraries must be rewritten now and again, and knowledge gets lost in spite of our historians\u2019 best efforts. We know you move differently than we do, and have bodies unlike ours, but not entirely.\nWe know you love the same, and hate better.\nI am not beautiful, by your standards or mine. I think I\u2019m pretty average looking. Slick and dark, thick skin, and eyes that glow. I want to be a scientist when I get older, and I don\u2019t have even the most minute interest in wasting myself on any other occupation. I\u2019ve known since I could think that the most interesting moment of ocean life comes when you go belly up. My area of expertise will be life post-ascension. I\u2019ll conduct experiments, and ask unanswerable questions, which may make me a philosopher too. This is the plan, and has been ever since I was a child. I\u2019m very focused like that. All I want to do now is go farther up, but it gets too warm so quick. Too bright even quicker.\nI\u2019m young and can only guess; but it seems likely I have a long time to live on the ocean floor.\nMy mother and father are very good. They\u2019ve given me so much love, but no means of escape. They\u2019re so content down here, and to avoid terrifying them, I\u2019ve termed my craving for ascension, what one might call a death wish, a fascination with the light.\nAnd maybe that\u2019s all it is. I just like to know things. I like mysteries, and unexplained phenomena. I swam as high as I could the other day, but I\u2019ll go higher soon, then higher, and higher. Tomorrow. I\u2019ll ignore the pain and heat. As a child I was always too cold, anyway. There are vents down here, oozing water from warm to scalding. I love them all, and have the burns to prove it.\nSo I am, for the most part, average looking, but I am also scarred by my love of heat. And inside I am two things at once; I am an underwater scientist, and I am also pure light in fish form, living forever in the cool and cozy dark. I may seem like I\u2019m made for life in the midnight zone, but I promise I\u2019m really not.\nMy mother knows this about me, and understandably it worries her. She said to me today, \u201cPromise you\u2019ll only go to 5,000 meters. No higher than that. You drive me crazy.\u201d\nAny closer to the surface and I\u2019ll risk ascension.\nMy mother says she loves me more than water. Water is what holds us, keeps us afloat but always covered. We talk about an oversoul; one spirit we\u2019re all a part of. Maybe your kind is a part of it too. This is what water means to us. We all live in it, and it carries things. My mother says I\u2019m like water to her, and my father says I may kill them both.\n(This is, apparently, what it\u2019s like to have kids. You\u2019re ready to die at any moment.)\n\u201cI understand curiosity, and boredom. I\u2019ve never asked you to stay in one place,\u201d my father told me a few days ago.\nBecause it\u2019s been getting worse. I feel so terrible for putting them on edge. They talk a lot about when I was born. We\u2019re born from mothers writhing in pain, and then joy, just like you. But I don\u2019t understand how this works with regards to ascension \u2014 it seems to be the case your kind is born in the light, born ascended, with no transformation necessary.\nWhich demands the question of what exactly you are. Something more than human? Your holy texts say everybody is made in the image of god. If so, am I part god, part fish? I\u2019ve wondered more than once if we\u2019re only an experiment of yours, left long ago to tire ourselves out.\nI\u2019m not sure anymore whether I believe our teachings \u2014 that when we ascend we\u2019ll live forever at the surface. I might, hence the literally scalding need to see the light. But before any of this, before the blinding haze, we begin and end in the water.\nMy life started with immense happiness, and gratitude. My parents wanted a baby for a very long time before I was born. I\u2019m afraid of hurting them. So I only take little trips. Higher and higher each time, as close as I can come to ascension, and then back down to the world I know. My friends love hearing about it but never want to come. I have a lot of friends, despite the fact that all I like to do is talk about myself and try then inevitably fail to figure out the innately unknowable. Must be something about me.\nToday, Meera asked me, \u201cCan we go to the caves?\u201d\nEvery day, she wants to go deeper and get more lost, just as I want to go higher, further out into the open.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked. Whined.\nOur voices have a way, in the water, of translating to a sort of humming. More vibration than sound, but we still hear each other perfectly well. Our scientists have long since discovered that even our language is shaped by the water we live in. This is another reason I want to go all the way up; to hear what the surface sounds like, away from the trenches and caves. You can get lost in them, which is nice, but you\u2019ll always find your way out.\nAnd that\u2019s a problem for me.\n\u201cI just like to hide and talk,\u201d Meera said. (This is not, in any way, abnormal.) \u201cYou\u2019re never happy with what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not that. Really. I\u2019m rather singularly minded, that\u2019s all.\nI\u2019ve started to plan my days vertically. How far I want to go and when. Today I\u2019m feeling brave and selfish. I\u2019ll stop home now, for a while. Tonight I\u2019m meeting friends. To talk. In the abyss you really only have the ones around you. So all we ever do is talk.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll miss you if you\u2019re late. Try to be back in time. Please,\u201d my mother says. It\u2019s so little to ask, and she says it like I\u2019m a lost cause.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I tell her, no argument or promises. I tell her I love her, then swim away.\nDown here, girls wear little lights tied around their tails. Little glowing balls, like the rod of an anglerfish. Without those, we\u2019re a flash of black fin and see-through hair. Defined by tea-saucer eyes, just barely luminescent, but with no sense of our edges. Without the lights, you can barely see us when our backs are turned.\nI like being invisible. I like going without my lights. But my mother insists sometimes. Occasionally. Today she\u2019s in the mood to worry and ties them on. So she can see me as I swim away, growing dimmer. It comforts her. It comforts me a little too, in a strange way. Then it turns sad.\nI can see her eyes from far off. I can watch her watching me, until a cloud of microorganisms comes between us. Then I\u2019m all by myself. It\u2019s a beautiful and frightening thing to look up from where I am. It makes me feel full. Nothing else can make me feel this way, so I\u2019m always chasing more of it. Higher and higher, until there\u2019s nowhere left to go but beyond that sacred threshold. It\u2019s a struggle, as everything is, to get so close without going somewhere from which fish don\u2019t return belly down.\nDown here I can catch outlines and white smiles in the dark. Anything fluorescent. Looking towards the surface, nothing is glowing. I\u2019m staring up at empty space for quite a while, because I\u2019m still too close to home. Swimming fast but barely aware I\u2019m moving at all. Until I reach a certain point, an indeterminable distance from both the surface and the ocean floor: I see something, just a bit of brightness. Not even light. Just less intense black.\nThen blue. It\u2019s hot. It\u2019s getting too hot, but I like it.\nIt\u2019s light enough that my tail looks dark against the water. Down where we live, it\u2019s so hard to see that I\u2019m covered in perfect scales, smooth and small, now glowing in the uplit water.\nI have never been this far up before. I\u2019m staring at myself now, and only myself. At parts of my body I\u2019ve never looked close at. Burns here and there. I never learned. I never learn. Worse than that\u2013\u2013when I was little, no matter how many times it happened, I would swim over the same vents. Into the same scalding water.\nBurning is better than freezing. I am perfectly evolved to tolerate the cold. I\u2019ve just never learned to self-soothe, and never will. So I swim higher.\nAt some point I stop registering the heat. I\u2019m barely able to open my eyes anymore. That\u2019s how light it is. How close to the surface I am. Just not close enough. It\u2019s getting more intense, and the lights around my tail look dim, but I can\u2019t look at anything for longer than a second or two. My eyes are not made for this place.\nAnd I think of my mother, bright eyes in the dark. Following me. Fading very slowly. I almost turn and go back down, for her. I promised I wouldn\u2019t be late. So much implicit in that promise. I\u2019m sliced in half, with oily, dark things spilling out of me. Part of me is good. The other part is just taken by whatever this is.\nSo I go toward the light. I am enveloped, never more comfortable or less safe. Far from my mother and father. Far from birth and everything since then. I do not feel ready to ascend, all the way up. You can never come back down, and I know this.\nBut I\u2019m melting into beauty. Growing more tired. Something is filling me up, and I hope to the gods it\u2019ll take me somewhere good.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

The gypsy?\u201d\n\u201cNo, you did not, Lyle.\u201d\nI sighed real big so she knew I was mighty disappointed with myself.\n\u201cCertainly I mentioned the pigs?\u201d\nShe looked at me like I was stone cold crazy. Some mourning doves up in the tree tops cooed, and the wind rustled the grass a little bit.\n\u201cNow Lulu-Mae, I went to go talk to your Pa about your hand in marriage just this morning \u2013\u201c\n\u201cIs that right?\u201d she said, and flicked an ant right off the blanket we were sitting on.\n\u201cI dragged my sorry butt out of bed at the crack of dawn. It was cold this morning, so cold I couldn\u2019t fix my hair because the teeth on my comb was just a chattering away, and then when I said something you couldn\u2019t even hear it because the words would freeze right in the air.\u201d\n\u201cWho were you talking to?\u201d\n\u201cNobody, that wasn\u2019t the point. I just wanted to get a fresh start in the morning. But I couldn\u2019t find my boots, you see. I looked high and low, under the bed, out on the porch, and nothing. But you know how dang much I want to marry you.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you say when we are up in the hayloft, you say: \u2018Lulu-Mae, come on, just one little kiss and I\u2019ll marry you someday \u2026\u2019 but here I am, not even engaged \u2026\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t about to give up, no ma\u2019am \u2014 I was lucky. I was standing on the porch in my socks, and I saw that pair of hogs owned by Old Grandma Bones, so I called them over to me.\u201d\n\u201cHow you do that? Her pigs don\u2019t even listen to her.\u201d\n\u201cI took pig whistling in school,\u201d I said, \u201cyou know that perfectly well.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I did, but I\u2019d forgotten,\u201d she said.\n\u201cSo I called them over, and dang, I didn\u2019t need boots after all, I just jumped straight onto to those pigs\u2019 backs, one foot on each pig, and I said \u2018Hee-yaa, you dumb hogs, take me over to Lulu-Mae\u2019s house so I can talk to her Pa.'\u201d\nLooking very serious, Lulu-Mae poured us both a cup of coffee out of the thermos.\n\u201cSo I was going along, just whistling at them to speed up because they were moving so slow. I made it to the road in about five minutes, and from there it was a straight shot over to talk to your Pa \u2014 but there was Rombaro, the gypsy, just sitting there waiting.\u201d\n\u201cA gypsy? Oh Lordy, Lordy,\u201d she said.\n\u201cYep,\u201d I said. \u201cHe was sitting in his drag racer, flames painted so perfect on the side of it that you could feel the heat come up. I nearly got a third degree burn.\u201d\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d\n\u201cYou heard me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m beginning to think maybe I shouldn\u2019t go up to the hayloft with you anymore.\u201d\n\u201cJust hold on, hold on,\u201d I said to Lulu-Mae, and slurped up some of my coffee, \u201cso what the heck do you think I did? I said, \u2018My name is Lyle and I want to get over to my girl\u2019s house fast, so I can ask her Pa about marrying her.\u2019 So after Rombaro introduces himself he says to me, \u2018Lyle, I\u2019ll drive you over, this car is so fast I\u2019ve had to brake when I saw my own taillights from going around the block too fast. She\u2019s so quick she makes greased lighting rust.'\u201d\n\u201cGoodness,\u201d she said.\n\u201cOf course that was what I was hoping for, so he told me he\u2019d give me a ride if I was to give him those pigs. They weren\u2019t mine, but I knew if there was one thing a gypsy likes more than a pig, it\u2019s a stolen pig. So I said, \u2018As long as you go far and fast once you give me that ride, then these pigs are yours.\u2019 He was agreeable so I jumped in the car.\u201d\n\u201cBut you never did make it did you?\u201d Lulu-Mae said.\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said, shaking my head in deep disappointment. \u201cThat\u2019s where the alligator comes in.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten all about that alligator, how did that play into it?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Rombaro wanted those hogs for. He had a pet alligator right there in the backseat. He told me it had been depressed lately and been on a long crying jag. Like maybe it was needing something special, and he figured a pig would be just the thing. So I tossed back one of them pigs, and lo and behold that alligator gobbled it right up in one big bite. Well, the second pig saw what was in store for it, and it up and bolted. Took off right on down the road squealing all the way. Since I couldn\u2019t keep my part of the deal anymore Rombaro just kicked me right out of his car. The sun was coming up proper by then, and Rombaro took off so fast the shadow of his car just stuck right there for a minute,\u201d I scratched at my chin, thinking. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if that shadow was that slow, or if it was frozen to the ground.\u201d\n\u201cYou poor thing out in that cold,\u201d Lulu-Mae said. \u201cI bet your feet where just freezing!\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I said. \u201cBut then, what did I see? My boots, they came walking down the road all by themselves. Just happy as can be.\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019d they go?\u201d Lulu-Mae said, and wrapped up the crust of her sandwich in some waxed paper.\n\u201cNot sure,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I think they were just trying to stay warm, you know how walking will do that.\u201d\n\u201cOh I do,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThen, wouldn\u2019t you know it?\u201d I said. \u201cJust when I was ready to go on over to see your Pa, my Pa was bellowing for me to come help with the chores. And you know it just wouldn\u2019t be honest to go running off and leave my poor old Pa to do all the work.\u201d\n\u201cNot honest in the least,\u201d she said, and finished packing up our stuff.\n\u201cBut there\u2019s always tomorrow,\u201d I said, very hopeful.\nShe smiled real pretty and gave me a kiss on the cheek.\n\u201cWell, Lyle, I hope some day you\u2019ll make an honest woman out of me, but I hope I never make an honest man out of you. I\u2019ll just see you in the hayloft after supper,\u201d she said.\nBosley Gravel was born in the Midwest, and came of age in Texas and southern New Mexico.

The fans provided to keep their flat sheets a-billow were quite noisy, far too noisy to permit introspection, or plotting, and certainly not procurement of arrows sharp enough to pierce polyester airship skin.\nThe noise inside the ground balloons is in fact so great that the people have grown to distrust human speech, preferring the mechanical buzz of the fans and the messages that go blip blip in greens and blues across their telephone screens.\nThe loneliness would overwhelm them if they could ever hear their own thoughts, but instead they pull their scraps tighter and look at the imperfect dome of their sheets and imagine they are weightless in a field of stars.\nFar above in the dirigibles, children fall asleep to a steady hum coming from the ground, as reassuring as a mother\u2019s heartbeat.\nMy Fantasy America\nBy Elizabeth Gonzalez James\nI: Chardonnay (May 29)\nII: Zenith (July 4)\nIII: Shoppingtown (Sept. 5)","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

It is tiny now, when he is cuddled at his mother\u2019s breast. It will grow into a dragon that will hunt down and despoil women like his mother. Women like the one I used to be.\nI don\u2019t know what I look like now but my tail grows every time another man lies broken at my feet. It rustles and rattles as I drag it around piles of brick and stone. It is as long as a city block, composed of scaly segments that keep adding up like beads on a necklace. But I can barely feel it. My strength grows, too.\nSome women have taken to following me in worship: singing songs, beating drums, even trying to flash out men from their hiding places.\nIt is satisfying, but not as satisfying as finding him will be.\nWild dogs roam the streets, and run away when they hear my rattle. A salty wind blows from the sea. A restless sparkle of waves throws gold and silver.\nIt happened on the beach. I walked along the lacy fringe of the surf, my feet caressed by the water. The sun was setting. I was happy. I remember that. I don\u2019t remember what I was happy about. There are many things that have disappeared from my memory.\nNo, not disappeared. They have been stolen. By him.\nHe came from behind me. It was so sudden that when I found myself half-submerged in the chilly water, in the dark, my first thought was that the world had blinked somehow and time lurched forward.\nBut the pain told me otherwise.\nAnd though the sea had washed away most of the blood, enough remained to tell me I was no longer fit for the Temple.\nI was looking forward to my initiation into the vestal sisterhood. Now\u2026what was I? Worthless. Polluted. Discarded.\nThis was what I thought at the moment. Now I see how mistaken I was. He wanted to destroy me but he has only made me stronger. He tried to lower me to the level of beasts; now I am above him, above all humanity.\nThe women behind me are chanting and shaking tambourines. But through the noise the dry clatter of my tail is still audible. It is flowing after me like a river of silver scales, sweeping aside the rubbish littering the street: bricks, broken glass, marble fragments.\nCorpses.\nWhen I glance down, I see a pair of legs, dark and sinewy like olive trunks, supporting the girth of my new body. And when I touch my forehead, something cold and oily slithers across my fingers.\nI was beautiful. Now I am divine.\nI stop before a small dwelling on a side street. It is still whole, one of the few. When I am done, nothing will be left of the city. The city that used to be mine but now is the hiding-hole of my rapist.\nThe familiar acrid smell assaults my nostrils and my rattle is deafening. The women behind me fall silent. My hair \u2013 or whatever it is that crowns my head now \u2013 stands up in rage.\nI did not see his face. But this stench \u2013 like burning dung, like carrion rotting under the midday sun \u2013 is how I will recognize him.\nHe may have transformed himself into a mewling babe or an old man but the stench of his violation will never go away until I find him.\nIt is now as horribly intimate as my own.\nMy tail flails and walls tremble and collapse in a cloud of dust. Two figures crawl out of the ruins. They stand up, holding hands.\nThe girl is irrelevant: I barely glance at her, just to ascertain her sex. But the male\u2026\nMy neck flushes with angry blood and something expands around my face like an unfolding flower. My hair rises with a hissing sound. My rattle beats summons to the execution.\nHe staggers toward me. He may be twelve or so.\nHe is male.\nThe girl steps forward.\n\u201cMedusa,\u201d she addresses me and it takes me a moment to remember that is used to be my name. \u201cMy brother is innocent. He is my twin and I know his heart as I know my own. He would never assault a woman.\u201d\nHer words wash over me. The hissing and the rattling drown them in irrelevance.\nThere is a snake between his thighs. He is a man. He is a rapist.\nThe swollen tension in my neck expands; my head is dragged up; my tail coils and lashes out.\nThe boy cries out \u2013 just a single strangled cry \u2013 and falls on his face. A bloody halo expands around his head that has hit the cobbles with a wet sound. A jerk on my tail as another segment is added to the rattle.\nThe girl drops onto her knees by her brother\u2019s body.\nIs it him?\nI look around at the field of rubble that the city has become. The sea flashes and dances beyond the embankment.\nThere must be more men left. Somewhere. The stench is still there; I can smell it, thick and nauseating.\nI will find him.\nI make to move forward but the girl jumps to her feet and bars my way.\n\u201cGreat goddess of vengeance,\u201d she says. \u201cMedusa, the Gorgon, who rights the wrongs of women. Let me show you my appreciation of your great work by washing the dust of our unworthy city off your feet.\u201d\nI pause, uncertain how to react. This was how the vestals used to honor the immortals.\nPoseidon, who I worshipped in those days \u2014 I used to bring clean sea water to pour over his statue in the Temple. But this girl \u2026 is it right that she should be my vestal?\nAnd while I am hesitating, the girl lifts a bronze vessel filled with water. But instead of washing my feet with it, she brings it up to my face. And in the mirror of its calmness, I see myself.\nI see the cobra-like cowl around my neck, swelling in rage, its fungal flesh flushed with venom. I see the armor of bony plates running down my breast and merging with the pewter scales of my tail. I see a tangle of oily verminous bodies whipping around my head.\nAnd I see my own face.\nIt is him.\nMy rapist. The god whom I worshipped.\nPoseidon, who took a mortal girl with no more thought than plucking a flower, and left her, broken and defiled, on the beach.\nPoseidon, who is forever beyond the reach of human revenge.\nPoseidon who is not a man.\nImmortals do not care for our pain. They have no justice and no mercy. They do what they do.\nShe called me \u201cgoddess,\u201d that girl whose brother I just killed in retribution for a crime he had not committed.\nYes, indeed, I am a goddess now. A rattlesnake of heaven. A creature who destroys because she can.\nLooking into my own empty eyes, breathing in the burning smell of my own transformed flesh, I feel my hatred harden into the shell around my body, squeezing air out of my lungs.\nThe worms on my head stiffen and tumble down in a shower of shards. The segments of my tail separate and fall like a line of dominoes.\nA stone cracks somewhere and I realize it is my breastbone.\nVengeance is mine, I think as I turn to stone.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Once or twice a week, I am swept into oblivion, but I recur, because there are always more tourists, and always more women, and always more fliers, and always more guys to drop the fliers.\nFrom empty pavement, Jeff and another twelve or so guys reconstruct me, dropping fliers, until I am all but continuous, until a tourist could walk from Circus Circus to Trump International Las Vegas without setting foot on pavement.\nThey step instead on skin \u2014 mine \u2014 and that of a thousand nude bodies, bent-over women, staring wanton over their hanging breasts, merged now into a single image of obscenity. Like a gravid snake I have one body, extensive, slithering kinky down Las Vegas Road, but holding within me a thousand half-formed bodies, each nested nude inside me.\n\u201cCheap and hot!\u201d calls Jeff. He presses Candie into the hand of a tourist, a casually dressed white man. The tourist frowns at Jeff, but he holds the card walking away. Then he giggles at it with a friend, also casually dressed and white. Eyes float sideways \u2013 the tourist possessed of Candie wants to see whether his friend is looking before deciding what to do with the flier.\nI can tell that the man wants to put Candie into his pocket, maybe to call and meet with her, or maybe just to have the image, since it is 1995 and there is yet very little internet porn.\nBut he is embarrassed to pocket the image in front of his friend, and I know the flier will be mine. I am right: it flutters down and merges into me. Candie is kneeling, nearly prone, and the red of her high heels draw the eye from the amalgam of breast and buttock that crowd around her.\nJeff hands the next four fliers out without comment. He gives one to a Taiwanese businessman, who turns to him puzzled. The man points at the number but Jeff just nods, so the businessman turns and drops the card.\n\u201cJeff,\u201d I say, \u201cwhat about your commission?\u201d He receives a small bonus each time a patron uses his name when ordering a woman.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t seem like he was into it,\u201d Jeff says.\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t know that,\u201d I say.\nJeff looks away from me to hand out another card. It goes to a pair of older African-American women, one of whom jams it back in his chest.\n\u201cNo!\u201d she says. Her eyes trace my contour into the intersection, and she grimaces at the other flier men.\nJeff looks down at me again. He used to look at the bodies within me. Now he sees me as I am. He shrugs.\n\u201cSomething is wrong,\u201d I say.\nHe pretends to look at Candie\u2019s buttocks with sexual interest \u2013 this is his way of avoiding eye contact with me.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t even have her anymore,\u201d Jeff says, of Candie. \u201cThey should take her off the flier. It isn\u2019t fair to the others. The customers think they\u2019re getting someone else, and it doesn\u2019t go well for the girls. Kayla got beat up for that last night. She went out to see a guy and he got mad that she wasn\u2019t the one on the flier. I saw her coming in for her paycheck when I picked these up today, and she had a black eye. Told me all about it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s on your mind?\u201d I ask.\nHe shrugs, nods slowly. Then he jumps about in boredom, trying to regain his energy. He steps back and forth, hopping over me out of respect.\nNow his eyes pass beyond me, out toward my vanishing point, between the block angles of the hotels, up the long line of cars passing up the bad-land mountains. Another line crosses back down the same road, white lit, like a trail of ants bringing treasure into the Queen. In the distance, the twin red and white lights run in between the sharply peaking mountains.\nJeff watches the lines a moment, then looks back down at me, searching for Marlee, whose red necklace runs provocatively between her breasts. The road and the mountains have reminded him of her, but tonight she is scarce within me.\n\u201cIt\u2019s strange,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s really the same shape out there.\u201d He points toward the mountains, which protrude breast-like from the ground. As he points, Jeff slaps a card into the hands of a middle-aged Hispanic man, here with his wife. The man takes it, apologizes to his wife, and then drops it. This adds another Candie to my Northwest tail.\n\u201cMountains, they\u2019re the same shape, but they have no effect on me. No effect on any men. Same thing, if you squint, sort of, but nobody pays money or gets excited or gets\u2026\u201d The end of the sentence waits patiently for him.\nAn older woman \u2013 white and hobbling \u2013 slips on a pair of supine Ninas. The upper Nina slides over the bottom Nina\u2019s glossy surface, under the old lady\u2019s heel, so that the older lady swings backwards like a comedian on a banana peel.\nIn another ten years she would have been using an assisted mobility device, but this is not quite that era, and Jeff must lurch into action to catch her by the shoulders. It isn\u2019t the first incident of older people slipping on me.\n\u201cCareful, beautiful,\u201d he says, \u201cyou\u2019re way too gorgeous for a bruise.\u201d\nHer face twists confused, and then into a smile.\n\u201cCharmer,\u201d she says, \u201cyou know I\u2019ve already got some bruises from the shower.\u201d\n\u201cWell you can come by and show me sometime,\u201d he says. Jeff rotates her body up 45 degrees like a mover tilting a heavy dresser on a dolly. She cuffs him on the shoulder and tells him to stop. She is not thinking about liability or police officers, so Jeff has succeeded.\nThe pedestrian flow picks up a little, and Jeff does too. He sets up three potential commissions to ASU fraternity boys in rapid succession.\n\u201cAsian?\u201d one of them asks. \u201cAsian? Asian?\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Jeff says, \u201cwhatever you like. Don\u2019t forget to tell them Jeff sent you. Jeff, got that? I\u2019m making a living out here.\u201d\nThe frat boys stumble out, and one of them stumbles drunk on me, nearly falling like the elderly lady. His eyes fall onto Alana, prone, eyes closed, mouth circled, and he picks her off of me.\n\u201cI like her better,\u201d he says. It\u2019s the same phone number, though.\n\u201cThat was well done,\u201d I say.\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t hard sells,\u201d he says, \u201cguys like that. Come on.\u201d\nA pause returns. \u201cSo, the mountains,\u201d I say. \u201cThey don\u2019t make guys excited. Most of them, anyway.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe weirdos,\u201d he says. \u201cOr explorers. But not sexually excited. Or maybe mountain climbing and exploring is a kind of sexual excitement. Maybe they\u2019re just trying to make love to the ground, climb around on it, appreciate it, lose themselves in it, like a woman\u2019s body. Or a man\u2019s, you know,\u201d he chuckles, \u201cI\u2019m not here to judge. God knows that. But I can, I could see how someone could fall in love with the ground,\u201d he chucks me playfully with his foot, displacing a Nina, \u201cafter all we\u2019ve come to mean to each other, carpet of pornographic escort fliers.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, Jeff,\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019re my favorite flier-guy. But what were you saying before? For the most part, men don\u2019t get excited by the shape of mountains, even though they\u2019re just like breasts, and they don\u2019t get \u2026\u201d\nHe looks down me, and then away.\n\u201cUsed to it.\u201d We say it together.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an occupational hazard,\u201d I tell him. \u201cSome guys fall off of buildings washing windows or building giant hotels.\u201d The wind helps me point my East tail at the MGM Grand, which rises up amid the distant blinking. \u201cThe MGM Grand lost five builders falling off roofs. And then poor Kayla. That\u2019s just as bad. You not being able to \u2026 not so bad in the grand scheme.\u201d\nJeff nods a little. \u201cNot so bad.\u201d He breathes. \u201cCarpet,\u201d he says, \u201cboy am I glad I caught that old lady when I did. Hoo. Didn\u2019t need any part of where that coulda gone.\u201d\n\u201cI bet,\u201d I say, \u201cand you sure didn\u2019t need to see another bruise on a woman.\u201d\nJeff swallows, and bends his knees in a squat. In the Vegas skyline, he is multiply dwarfed, by mountains, and by cascades of ever growing hotel-casinos, each emphasizing the smallness of its predecessor, and so of him. Now he is on his knees.\n\u201cDoes your girlfriend have a bruise right now?\u201d I ask.\nHe nods.\n#\nJeff did not return to me again after that night, which I suppose is for the best. I know it\u2019s best for him to be out of this gig.\nBut I miss him, and I have needs too, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s selfish to wish him back now and then. Sometimes I consider maybe appearing in one of his dreams, just to chat. After all we meant to each other, and all we talked about in the years he stood and made me, surely at least part of him would be happy to see me.\nBut I haven\u2019t; I\u2019ve left him alone. I don\u2019t think I could handle it if I showed up in his dream and appeared monstrous to him.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Along the way, she gets her car repaired by Elvis Presley.\nThe final excerpt is a pair of letters from Dr. Abraham\u2019s teacher, Dr. Thomas Hunter, a white abolitionist whose riveting correspondence recounts his militant radicalization at a speech by Frederick Douglass at Bethel Church in Baltimore, in the tumultuous months following Brown\u2019s July 4 raid.\nI \u2014 Dr. Abraham\u2019s Narrative, 1859\nThat night I went to see Cricket out at Green Gables, the plantation two miles out of town where Mama had lived before she\u2019d been bought by old Deihl. Like most town folk, I had mixed feelings about field slaves. They seemed ignorant, passive, backward; yet I was drawn to them inexplicably as if toward a dream I had forgotten and was trying to remember. There were almost thirty Africans at Green Gables, and they usually knew the truth of things, since the plantations were on the \u201cpeavine\u201d that didn\u2019t pass through town. Like a fool, I was as excited by the horse as by the raid, but Cricket soon set me straight. \u201cOnce we get freedom,\u201d he said, \u201cthen we\u2019ll have all the horses we want.\u201d It began to dawn on me, that the fighting in Harper\u2019s Ferry had some purpose besides making the white folks angry and providing me with a little excitement.\n\u201cI saw them this morning,\u201d I said. \u201cHonest. They were walking into town, all with guns, and one of them \u2026\u201d\n\u201cHush,\u201d Cricket said, rapping the top of my head with his big knuckles. \u201cLearn to keep your big mouth hushed up.\u201d I almost cried, he hit so hard. Cricket was three years older than I, and when you\u2019re twelve that seems like a century. Cricket was my cousin; he was my mentor, my secret idol, the big brother I\u2019d never (I then thought) had. All the black folks were talking about the raid anyway, so I didn\u2019t see why I couldn\u2019t. There was a granny woman at Green Gables, and she said that God would send a sign of deliverance, a fire on the mountain. Sure enough, as soon as it got darker we saw it, blazing like a star that had come down and landed right on top of the ridge. All the talking stopped. All you could hear was wood and leather hinges creaking and children being hushed as everybody came out of the cabins and stood there watching, watching, watching.\n\u201cFire on the mountain,\u201d the granny woman said. \u201cThey up there sharpening they swords.\u201d Then she said that word again: freedom. It had a shivery ring to me, and I wasn\u2019t sure I liked it. I was afraid of granny women anyway. I told Cricket, and he told me to hush up again, then put his arm around my shoulder as if to apologize, and we stood there watching. I was nervous; I was afraid the white folks would see us and know what we were thinking. I looked behind me to the big house, but the curtains were all drawn. The granny woman must have seen me look around, or maybe others had done the same. \u201cThey trembling just like in the Bible,\u201d she said. \u201cTrembling just like in the Bible.\u201d The fire blazed on, and finally I went home.\nII \u2014 Yasmin\u2019s Journey, Nova Africa, 1959\nLike all kids, Harriet loved to peel growstone: softer than balsa wood but stronger than concrete, it flaked off satisfyingly in thumbnail-shaped moons. She amused herself with the bridge rail (which would, of course, grow back smooth again) while the grown-ups argued; then she asked the question she already knew the answer to.\nFrom here the road led across the top of the mountain, through Bear Pond Gap, Grissom told her. \u201cShould we drive up there and have a look? Like your father,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re drawn to the high places.\u201d\nThat made Harriet grin and made Yasmin angry. She couldn\u2019t tell if Grissom had said it to defy her silence about Mars, or to acknowledge it and make it seem more natural. Either way, his presumption angered her.\n\u201cHarriet, quit picking at the bridge,\u201d she said, and got into the driver\u2019s seat. It was, after all, her car. Sort of.\nThe top was a disappointment. The mountain was covered with white oak, maple, and hickory forest, turning beautiful in October colors; but there were few pines, no bare rocks, no feeling of height, even though they were at over a thousand feet. The mountain top was broad and flat where the road crossed and there was no view. Harriet got out of the car anyway, and stood on her tiptoes, as if maybe that last inch would reveal something.\nYasmin was just getting out of the car when, suddenly, two people crashed out of the brush at the side of the road. It was a man and a woman carrying backpacks topped with tents and bedrolls. Yasmin jumped back. With a wave the two crossed the road and disappeared into the brush on the south side of the road. Yasmin leaned back against the car, alarmed at how her heart was pounding. For a second, with their giant backpacks and white hats, they had looked like P.A.S.A. cosmonauts.\n\u201cThere is a trail that runs along the top of the mountain, following the route of the Army of the North Star,\u201d Grissom was explaining to Harriet. Then he noticed Yasmin looking as though she\u2019d seen a ghost: \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\nShe nodded.\n\u201cHundreds of people hike it every year,\u201d Grissom went on. \u201cNot just Mericans and n\u2019Africans, but Canadians, Quebecois, Oka, Dineh, even Europeans. All the way from New England to Alabama. The section from Harper\u2019s Ferry to here is especially pretty; it goes past False Fire, only a mile from here.\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever hiked it?\u201d Harriet asked.\nYasmin scowled at her daughter as she got back into the car. What a question to ask a one-legged man. But Grissom didn\u2019t seem to mind.\n\u201cAll the way. As a boy scout from Chicago, forty years ago. Before the Revolution,\u201d he said. \u201cSince then, not so much.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get a pseudo-leg?\u201d\n\u201cThe hip\u2019s all messed up, nothing to work it with.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t you hike on crutches?\u201d\n\u201cYou probably could from here; you\u2019re already on top of the mountain. The trail coming up from the river is rough, though. I\u2019ll show it to you; you can see the beginning of it from the museum. What\u2019s that noise?\u201d\nYasmin pulled the starter again.\nTe-oonk te-oonk te-oonk\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\nTe-oonk te-oonk\nThe engine fired, then there was a horrible clatter like dishes falling.\n\u201cShut it off!\u201d Grissom yelled.\nYasmin had already shut it off. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I think you lost your polarization.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\u201cAre we stuck?\u201d Harriet asked.\n\u201cIt means we switch over to planetary drive,\u201d Grissom said.\n\u201cPlanetary?\u201d Yasmin said, moving over and letting him into the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cMother!\u201d Harriet was already pushing, laughing.\nYasmin got out and joined her.\n\u201cPlanetary drive. Gravitational. In layman\u2019s words,\u201d\nGrissom said, \u201cwe roll down the hill.\u201d The car was rolling faster. \u201cLuckily, the old guy in the house trailer by the bridge is an internal-combustion mechanic.\u201d Yasmin quit pushing and jumped into the front seat and slammed the door. \u201cI know because I interviewed him for a folklore project last summer.\u201d Harriet jumped into the back seat and slammed the door. \u201cLewis, that was his name.\u201d They whooshed silently around the long curves. \u201cNo, it was Leavis. No . . . \u201d The road looped through long halls of forest. \u201cAngus. Elbow. Pelvis. Elvis. That\u2019s it . . . \u201d At the bottom of the mountain, after a sharp turn, they fairly flew across the river on the bridge, toward the trailers in the sycamores.\n\u201cElvis Presley Cardwell.\u201d\nIII \u2014 Dr. Hunter\u2019s Correspondence\nAugust 16, 1859\nMiss Emily Pern\n11 Commerce St.\nNew York\nDear Emily:\nI am writing to tell you that my plans changed, I went to Bethel Church last night and saw the great Frederick Douglass. Instead of a funeral I attended a Birth. Instead of a rain of tears, the Thunder of righteousness. Even I, with my conservative (as you say!) Southern ways, was moved. How like a lion is Douglass, a statesman, a philosopher, and a fighter in one, and he has done more in these two days to alter my opinions on how to end Slavery (I had started to say On Slavery, but my opinions on that Evil institution were long ago fixed) than any other event or individual save, I must own, perhaps yourself.\nI went to Baltimore only to find that my Uncle had accompanied his son\u2019s body South, to Mint Springs, our farm in Staunton, saying that since John had died for Virginia he must be buried there. So I returned to Philadelphia in time to reach Bethel Church before Douglass. The notes I had hoped to get from others, I took myself, and it was well that I did, since my friends were busy with other matters, as you will see. Here they are: transcribed for you from the Latin which has served me well these four years:\nThe Church was secured by some fifty abs, many of them students; some of them friends of mine and others, I am sure, friends of yours; and all armed with belaying pins from the docks. The greater number, perhaps half, were free Colored, most of them unionists from the seaport, but tradesmen and craftsmen as well. Some Irish stevedores as well. They all were led by a colored Teamster named Adam who is a stalwart of the movement here and apparently an intimate of Douglass, although he appears to be entirely innocent of letters. Over five hundred filled the church and an even greater number filled the street outside, since the whole town had cause to think that Douglass would speak on the subject of Brown\u2019s Attack, which as you must have heard by now he did. It was also known that the Federal Marshals had a warrant for Douglass since his name (among others) had been found among the effects left behind by Brown in the Maryland farmhouse from which he launched the assault that shook, not only the South, but the Nation.\nIf the Marshals and writ-servers were in the crowd, though, they were invisible and kept their peace, at least at first. Also, if the Copperheads and slave catchers had any Intentions they were not so bold, not that night, as to make them known. Certainly the street, filled as it was with the young, the hopeful, the working people, and half of them freed Colored, was a Republican and friendly crowd for Douglass; my friend and former French instructor Levasseur said of the crowd on the street that it looked like Paris in \u201848. Lev was one of the Stalwarts \u2018on call,\u2019 as he put it, in case of trouble, and in addition to the pin stuck in his waistcoat, he had tucked a LeFebre repeater in the top of one \u2018Victor Hugo\u2019 boot; I caught only a glimpse of this as my friend is not the type, like others who were plentiful last night, to show it off as a vain augmentation of Manliness.\nWe heard Douglass approaching long before he arrived. It sounded like a storm coming through the mountains, the trees waving and sighing overhead before the wind and rain that move them are felt\u2014this was the murmuring of the crowd outside the church doors. Everyone in the church stood as he came in the door and down the aisle, \u201cLike the priest in the Church of Man,\u201d whispered Levasseur, who has a Jacobin turn of mind to fit his colorful waistcoats and high boots. The atmosphere was electrical.\nThe Colored minister, before introducing Douglass, alarmed I think by the mood and spirit of the crowd, called on God to fill our hearts with peace and love.\nDouglass\u2019s first words might have displeased old Robespierre, but not of course John Brown (and Levasseur seemed well enough pleased himself), for they also called upon God, though not the God of the slave owners. \u201cAlmighty God\u201d Douglass said, and if God didn\u2019t answer it wasn\u2019t because he didn\u2019t call out loudly enough. \u201cFill our hearts with love, but not with peace. Not yet. It is too soon for peace. Fill them rather with a tempest, with a storm of love for Man and a tempest love for Freedom. And also fill (here he paused and his voice dropped) fill our hearts with hatred (here the crowd including myself gasped!) Hatred for evil. Hatred for slavery, the foul enemy of man and freedom and love, slavery which degrades both subject and master!\u201d\nA roar, half response and half applause, filled the hall, and Douglass held up his hand but could no longer stop it; he let it wash over him like a wave. He is a giant in stature as well as principle, six feet tall, wearing a pepper and salt suit of rather ordinary cut and a dark silk tie, no Jacobin, looking more like a banker than a revolutionist. Until he speaks: for there is no stiffness about his features. Just as his voice is like a chorus, his face is like a company of players, in which Humor, Tragedy, Wisdom, and Courage all are on stage at once. Though not exactly handsome, he is more distinguished in appearance than any Colored man I have ever seen. His head looks almost too large for his body, and his massy hair gives it a leonine look. He is the very opposite of stooped, if that be possible; he is bent a little upward, toward the sky, and his voice rolls out like thunder.\n\u201cThere is much talk and speculation about a certain commotion down South,\u201d he said, to laughter and some cheers. \u201cThere are even those who rumor that my hand was involved.\u201d Here he studied his hand as if puzzled. More cheers. \u201cThere are rumors about another African, a woman who is well known and well hated by the slavers; a thief, this wicked woman, who regularly steals their property and then defies them to steal it back.\u201d\nMore tumult and cheers.\n\u201cThere is talk of an old man, no gentleman he, but a rough handed drover and tradesman, a man of God whose hands know both the Bible and the Sword, a white man well known to the slavers out Kansas way.\u201d A regular tumult greeted these words. Douglass put a stop to it by raising his hand, then lowered his voice and addressed the waiting silence:\n\u201cMy friends, I did not come here to put all these rumors to rest. I come to encourage them. History will complete the roll call of the heroes of Harper\u2019s Ferry, but I will say this, and say it for a certainty . . . \u201d Here he paused again and peered out across the crowd as if looking for a face and then finding it. \u201cMany of you were there. You, and you, and you (he pointed dramatically) in spirit, were there. The true lovers of abolition and liberty all were there, Sharps rifles in hand; or will be there, WILL BE THERE (he fairly thundered) ready to consecrate with willing blood a long-overdue and long-neglected bond of brotherhood with the most oppressed and despised of humanity.\u201d\nAfter this last tumult died down, Douglass adjusted his tie, waved his hand, and seemed to call forth another, more thoughtful mood. The crowd was eager for more rhetoric, especially couched in such praise. But now he changed his tune.\n\u201cBut not yet, my friends, not all of us. This consummation is yet to come. Some of us stayed home. Some of us, and I don\u2019t exclude myself, stayed home. Some of us,\u201d (and here I admit it, Emily, my ears burned) \u201clove peace more than Freedom. Some of you whites would give the African his freedom, but not give him the gun with which to take it.\u201d\n\u201cNot Brown.\u201d\n\u201cSome of us Africans would ask for freedom, but not take up a Sharps and fight for it.\u201d\n\u201cNot Tubman.\u201d\n\u201cNot those of us who are with them tonight, either in spirit or On The Mountain. . . those of us who are True Abolitionists,\u201d (and here the word had a deeper and freer ring than I had ever heard before, bespeaking the end not just of slavery but of all darkness and ignorance and Hatred) \u201csons of Man and Reason, whether African or European, white or black, slave or free.\u201d\nThere was suddenly the sound of a scuffle outside, and a banging at the great church doors. With a signal from a Colored man, Levasseur was directed to the balcony, and at his gesture, I followed, though hesitating. Democratical as I am, I found it surprising to see a Frenchman taking orders from an African, and was reluctant to add a Virginian to this unusual chain of command. But Lev seemed not to notice my hesitation, and I had to either follow him or be left behind. In these speculations, and in moving upstairs, I lost the next few moments of Douglass\u2019s mighty talk. From the balcony we were looking down at the packed church and at Douglass in the pulpit, with a stout Negro armed with a staff at his either side.\nThe banging at the door continued, but he spoke over it:\n\u201cThink for a moment. What if John Brown had failed? What if he and his soldiers had been killed, or worse, captured? Oh, many a grand speech would then be made! Oh, what fiery denunciations of Virginia\u2019s cruelties we would then applaud! Brown and Tubman would be heroes and martyrs. Their men would be examples to us all of the willingness to sacrifice in the fight against slavery.\n\u201cBut, alas, my friends, Brown has confounded us all. He has done more than sacrifice. He has succeeded. He has drawn blood. Just as in Kansas, he has drawn blood. In Virginia the old man has lifted his sword and drawn the very fire from the heavens, the blood from the earth. The enemy has fallen back in Terror; and not just the enemy; his friends as well, you see, have fallen back in terror. The old man has succeeded, and therein, my beloved fellow lovers of Liberty, lies the rub. For you see, not only does the slave owner need the slave, the abolitionist needs him as well; oh yes! Yes! Needs him to follow, to wait, to be patient. The old type of abolitionist, I mean. The peaceful type. But now his day is gone. Now to fight slavery we must do more than pass resolutions and make strong talk, and pray for the powerful to change their minds. Now there is a new factor in the fight. Before, we had the familiar factors: the sullen slave owner, the fervent abolitionist, the wavering federal government, the slave groaning under his oppression; now we have a new factor, though none seem yet willing to call it for what it is.\u201d\nHere his eyes flashed.\n\u201cFire. There is a fire on the mountain. And Virginia can\u2019t put it out. America can\u2019t put it out.\u201d There was such a tumult and a crying out at this as my poor words on paper can never express or even indicate.\n\u201cI am here to tell you, friends of Liberty, that there is, at this very moment, an Army of Liberation, an army of abolitionists, black and white; and already, freed African slaves, the heirs of old Nat Turner, the staunchest abolitionists of all, the most dreaded and feared; the Army of the Blue Ridge, the Army of the North Star,\u201d (and here was the first time I heard it so called) \u201chigh in the mountains of Virginia. This army calls upon and needs your wholehearted support, more than any one man\u2019s martyrdom or example. For it has changed, and will forever change, the nature of the struggle against slavery. There is now no going back, for us or for them.\n\u201cHow can we support them? With our words. With our money. With our guns. With our sons. With our very lives. As they prevail, believe me, the struggle will spread to the North as well as the South, and we must prepare to face the same enemies they face.\u201d\nI lost my notes for the next few moments, but there was a collection, and hats were passed around the interior of the church and passed to the altar overflowing with currency, even though the crowd was far from a wealthy one. I heard more scuffling outside, then the alarm of a shot, and the banging on the door renewed, but louder.\nHere Douglass dropped his voice again, even as the pounding on the door increased in volume. His bodyguard, Adam I believe it was, tugged at his sleeve, but Douglass shook him off.\n\u201cAs you may know, there is a warrant for my arrest as a confederate,\u201d (he said) \u201cThey flatter me. I am flattered because I know whereof I speak when I speak of the fainthearted, the hands that faltered.\u201d He held out his hand, then studied it himself as if it were a book.\n\u201cHere is one hand that faltered. Black as it is, it faltered. Brown asked for my help, but I thought his scheme would fail. Our own Tubman knew him better. She knew the man, she knew the times, and most of all she knew our people. Now the two of them have my unconditional support, this hand is theirs, and if that be treason, if loyalty to my own dark, enslaved, suffering, and benighted people be treason to the U.S.A., so be it.\u201d\nAt this point, as if by a signal, the massive iron fittings gave way and the door crashed down, inward. Two of Douglass\u2019s guards wrapped him in a cloak as if to make him invisible, in a scene befitting Shakespeare, while others leaped to their feet in the aisle. The panicked crowd meanwhile drew back into the pews. Six, eight, twelve federal marshals swarmed in across the fallen door just as Douglass was being hastened out of the pulpit, toward the choir door. The minister, an older Colored man, pushed through the aisle to try and calm the scene, but the marshals knocked him aside roughly. The crowd muttered angrily and there were cries. I counted twelve marshals and remember thinking they seemed severely outnumbered, and feeling both exultation and fear. I saw guns beneath their long coats, but there were no shots, not at that time. The crowd fell back and the marshals pushed forward for the pulpit.\nThen full twelve of Douglass\u2019s men, the longshoremen, all black, filled the aisle, blocking them. Emboldened, but more slowly, others from the pews filled in behind them, placing a wall of men (and women) between the marshals and Douglass. Douglass himself stopped by the organ, drawing away from those who were hastening him through the choir door, to watch the drama behind him. The marshals ordered \u201cStand aside!\u201d but the men in the aisle neither made answer nor moved. They seemed to be under the command of the giant Negro Adam, who stood in their midst, but I could not be sure; it was all done with flickers of eyes. They held long wooden pins from the docks.\nThe leader of the marshals called over them directly to Douglass; he waved a piece of paper without reading from it; perhaps like many U.S. marshals, he could not read the papers he served but committed his writs to memory. Douglass answered him, but with what, in the muttering and scraping, I could not hear. The marshal swore and pointed his Walker Colt at the great vaulted ceiling of the church, and\u2014fired! Silence fell like thunder; the other marshals had opened their jackets and put their hands on exactly similar Colts. We all stood stunned; even Douglass froze like a statue at the choir door; all were stunned at the profanity of a shot in church: the only sound was the old preacher crying out \u201cOh, Lord\u201d as if he himself had been shot, until someone, I think it was his own Daughter, shut him up. His Colt still pointed up, the head marshal stepped forward toward the line of Colored men. At this their leader, Adam, instead of falling back as expected, raised his wooden pin and pointed with it, in a great slow arc, like Moses with his Rod, to the balcony of the church, first to the right and then to the left, where I was standing. There was a steely rattle like snakes all around me, and the marshals stopped and looked up. I was as surprised as they to see guns drawn all around me, cocked and primed. Levasseur held his LeFebre across his nose like a dueling master; others, mostly Colored but with some whites mixed in, and several of them students I knew, across from me and behind me did the same; stalwarts with derringers and ancient horse pistols and new Colt revolvers all held at point, held the high ground of the balcony; there were perhaps twenty of them at most, but they looked like a hundred to me, and must have seemed a thousand to the marshal and his men, who froze with their hands on their weapons but never drew them.\nThe marshal slowly lowered his piece, then lowered its hammer.\nEveryone else in the church stood stock still for a breath, then two, then three. I counted them. I was standing with the armed men and without intending it I had become part of the tableau; at least the marshals looking up seemed to include me in it as we faced each other across a newly opened gulf in our common history as white men, a gulf John Brown had opened when he had drawn his sword in common cause with the black. This moment lasted no more than a minute, and no less than a hundred years.\nThen with a flourish like Othello, Douglass was exeunt through the low choir door.\nA low hubbub grew to a shout as the marshals backed slowly out the front door; the pews emptied into the aisles, the balcony into the galleries, the back door into the alley, and with the others, my heart pounding, I melted away into the night, which had fallen unannounced while we had been fighting our War in the Church.\nIt was the old Minister who was the only loser. For later that same night, Cowardice daring where Courage had faltered, his church was burned to the ground, probably by the same marshals who had been unwilling to take us on.\nIf I say Us, does that make me one of the Stalwarts? I think not; I still cannot imagine myself taking up arms (odd Virginian, I!), though, my dear friend and colleague, I definitely passed over a line in my own Understanding that night; the scales fell from my eyes, which is appropriate in Church, I suppose. Not about violence, which was the false issue, for that was never the question, slavery itself being the very perfection of violence; and not about my poor beloved South, for her corrupt true nature had long been clear to me. No, I understood that to end slavery we would have to be fighting the Nation itself and not just a section of it. Those were not Virginians that had come to take Douglass. We had to go against the might of America itself. This was what the slaves had always understood.\nSo, as you see, if Life is the great Instructor, I have been attending Classes. I only hope now that my family does not find out about this attendance, on the very night of my young Cousin\u2019s funeral; I have never hidden my abolitionary sentiments from them, but it is a fool that adds insult to injury. But I have, as I have said, only sorrows and no regrets. I remain, as always, your admirer and always devoted friend and colleague,\nThos. Hunter, M.D. (ad imminen)\nPhiladelphia, City of Brotherly Love\nAug. 16, 1859\nMiss Laura Sue Hunter\nMiss Colby\u2019s School\nRichmond\nDearest Laura Sue:\nI was sorry to say I was unable to attend our dear young Cousin\u2019s funeral, which was held in Staunton, you know, not Baltimore, our uncle saying that since John bad died for Virginia he must be buried there. I would rather say, since it was Virginia that threw his life away, since it is a prodigious misapprehension of the Slave to think that he would submit to a Boy. I managed to get to Church on the night of the funeral, and my prayers were with you all.\nYour loving Thomas\nAcknowledgements\nA better world is not merely possible, but necessary, and speculative literature can provide the vision and imagination that can inspire the will to move mountains and transform nations.\nTo bridge the gap between imagination and action, we\u2019ve provided a short list of links to resources for political protest and policy advocacy.

But in my travels I have found there to be a multitude of phenomena that produce what I like to refer to as \u201cdarklight.\u201d In this guide, I will offer a description of each type of darklight on the ethereal spectrum and the possible locations where one might encounter the particular phenomenon. The following is not a complete guide, and serves only as a primer. (Rare but unsubstantiated phenomena such as Pixie Light and Demon Light will not be covered.)\nVesper Light\nVesper Light, also known as vespertillia, is an atmospheric dusk-time event where bats fly in such quick, erratic patterns as to supercharge the water molecules in the air, creating a miniature heat lightning in their wake. Optimum conditions for Vesper Light are warm, humid, moonless nights with an overabundance of mosquitoes. During observation, the consumption of alcohol is known to enhance the effect.\nGhost Light\nGhost Light can be found deep in the forest. It manifests as a lone, circular glow with a concentrated white center and a faint purple ring sometimes extending several feet in diameter. It is often accompanied by a stillness of both sound and activity, as if its appearance is a precursor to some woodland play about to be performed. In most cases, the mere act of looking upon it will cause it to wink out of existence.\nFog Light\nWe all know fog is a common occurrence produced by condensed water vapor, usually as a result of a warm body of air in contact with a colder substrata. Fog light is unconnected to these conditions and speaks to the quality of the light itself: a diaphanous brightening of the dark that can range in size from a doorway to as big as the mouth of an airplane hangar. Fog Light can appear anywhere but is most commonly found in large open areas such as fields or along highways where the traffic is thin, and can last for several seconds before decorporealizing. Some believe Fog Light is, in fact, a portal to another dimension, a chance alignment between two parallel worlds where the barriers are thinnest. It is believed that, every year, Fog Light is responsible for nearly a hundred disappearances around the world. (So keep your distance!)\nMemory Light\nMemory Light is divided into two categories: Yellow for memories of the past, and Blue for memories of the future. Yellow Memory Light, also called Hobo Light, appears in the company of vagrants and the homeless in the form of a yellow aura. It is postulated that the individual\u2019s strong lamentation (manifestations of guilt or regret) creates a prismatic effect in the heated air close to the body. Yellow Memory Light was often mistaken for distant campfires along riverbanks and under train trestles. Blue Memory Light manifests in a similar fashion but the individuals purported to exude along this spectrum are extremely insightful, playfully imaginative, and live in a thought-world unbound by the accepted constraints of the physical universe. If dreams could be a color, then blue is the color of what could be. The blue aura occurs when the individual experiences a sudden, oftentimes debilitating, withdrawal from the reality of what could be into the reality of what is. Anyone in close proximity of this rare phenomenon will be affected negatively with feelings of sadness and futility.\nGlimmer Light\nGlimmer Light is the faintest most fleeting on the ethereal spectrum. It is found almost exclusively at cemeteries. Glimmer Light happens so quickly and for such a brief period, it tends not to register to the observer\u2019s eye. Only due to the serendipity of late-night photography did the first case of Glimmer Light become known. Special stroboscopic eyewear has since been created to observe the rare phenomenon, which gave rise to the nationwide grave-watching craze of the last decade, fueled by speculation and misinformation that Glimmer Light was, in fact, the spirits of deceased loved ones still tethered to their physical bodies. The craze quickly declined when it was discovered that observers wearing the special glasses were absorbing much more than fragmentary light, and that the amount of unseen information entering the brain was detrimental, resulting in seizures, catatonia, and even death. Special filters have since been adapted to the glasses \u2014 so please, make sure you are using only FDA-approved Glimmer Glasses when hunting for Glimmer Light.\nFolk Light\nFolk light occurs near woodland trails or in open fields under a full moon. It can sometimes take the form of ball lightning or a will-\u2018o-the-wisp-type pattern that has given credence to many a local legend about the aforementioned Pixie Light and Demon Light. Folk Light is the most varied on the ethereal spectrum, manifesting in shapes consistent with those witnessed under the thrall of ergot poisoning. Many such reports usually follow a night of reverie at rural music festivals or events that involve the practice of Pagan rituals. Please note that outdoor nudity and uninhibited dancing by themselves will not cause Folk Light to appear.\nBodhi Light\nHimalayan climbers have long claimed the existence of Bodhi Light, a seemingly random coalescing of light particles that appears like a miniature swarm of incandescent insects. But the phenomenon has been discredited by the medical profession as a product of low oxygen levels at high altitude. While found almost exclusively at elevations of 10,000 feet or more, it is my belief that the numerous sightings of Bodhi Light around the world \u2014 from sheep herders in Pakistan to elk hunters in Colorado \u2014 are too similar to be manifestations of individual delirium. And if Bodhi Light is indeed a swarm of high-altitude insects performing a mating ritual, entomologists have yet to collect a single specimen. One thing is for certain: Witnesses to this light have claimed to experience a spiritual awakening, as if in the presence of something divine.\nTidal Light\nThe most uncommon of lights on the ethereal spectrum can be found in the most common of geographical regions of the world: the coastline. Tidal Light is that rarest of rare phenomenon because it is bound to the very nature of the coastline itself. Tidal Light can appear in a variety of colors based on the saline content of the water that gives it its name. Shimmering waves of blue have been observed as well as arcs of salmony pink, and every shade and geometric configuration in between. Due to a mathematical conundrum called the Coastline Paradox, where the fractal nature of any given coastline can vary in length based on the unit of measurement, the size, intensity and duration of Tidal Light is also in a constant flux. A virtual pinprick of light in a vast sea of darkness. There is no predicting where or when it will show up.\nAuthor\u2019s Note\nAnd so ends our brief tour of the ethereal spectrum of the night. I hope it has, at the very least, piqued your interest in this most unearthly of earthly phenomena. I\u2019m sure, as technological advances illuminate the world around us, and more acceptance of the esoteric nature of the ethereal spectrum grows among the populace, there will be an addendum to this guide at some later date. Until then, with open mind and open heart, good luck and happy sightings!","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Story and photography by Kevlin Henney.","hostname":"fabulistmagazine.com","source":"https:\/\/fabulistmagazine.com\/remembrance-of-things-past\/","sitename":"The Fabulist Words & Art","text":"It has been years since I last made this journey. I am slower and more easily tired. My footfall is not as sure as it used to be, but nor is it as bitter, as sad, as resigned.\nUp the slope, near the edge of the rock, they stand along the ridge. Waiting, without conversation, silhouetted against the late-afternoon sky. I am joining them.\nThe ground is dusty, sandy with scraps of sun-browned grass, like the dunes before a beach.\nTaken two months before today, the now-faded photo on my desk records our last family trip to the beach. Madeleine looking out from beneath the sunshade of her hand, her light smile overseeing the girls. Nell in her purple star sunglasses and pink flower hat, her mouth drawn in shadow \u2014 a preview of adolescence between the giggles and play. Where Nell\u2019s sandcastles are numerous, ordered and well-formed, Cathleen\u2019s are few and careless. Squinting and sunburnt, her sunglasses and hat willfully thrown aside, she beams a big camera smile, all teeth and gaps.\nPerfect in so many ways, imperfect in so many others. The eyes are hidden. I imagine I remember their glint and color, but I check other photos to be sure.\nI recall the sound of sea, but can I recall the sounds of that shoreline, those waves, on that day? Voices are easier. I can recall the mutter of idle nothings and words of comfort, although the words themselves are gone. And where are the smells? Of sea, of suncream, of Maddie\u2019s hair. Smells hide in memory, found only with a map that is also the key that is also the trigger. Perfectly locked, perfectly lost.\nI reach the top of the slope, catching my breath in the still air. No ocean, only scrubland and rocks and a road. The smell is of desert.\nThe crowd is all gathered, all but one. Madeleine and the girls will be along soon. We will watch them pass, these different ages of me. Compelled to migrate, we return to this past as our present is marked out by anniversaries, birthdays and other remembrances.\nWe will watch the accident and wonder the same things. Was it the fading light? Was Maddie tired after so long behind the wheel? Were the girls squabbling, distracting her? Was there something on the road? Or perhaps a fault with the car? Was there anything we had missed? Something we could do to change the outcome, anything to alter time and replace tomorrow.\nAcross the crowd we each wear age differently \u2014 haggard and kempt, mawkish and resolved, resigned and hopeful. Chasing possibility, three scan the road with binoculars while three others pore over notebooks of lists, figures and calculations. Each looking for the overlooked. Each hoping for a contradiction to be confounded, to be unravelled to reveal an alternative.\nBut hope is not common among us. A few look only at the ground in front of them. Most gaze across the desert at the darkened foothills and fading mountains. I catch momentary glances and a few stares. I remember being those others looking at this older self, noting the one in the crowd of selves obviously older and frailer than the rest, none older.\nThe last to join the crowd is walking up the slope. There are thirty years between us. His journey is the first I made to come to this rock, to watch the accident from afar instead of attempting intervention. He sees me. He pauses, fists clenched. I remember the resentment, the feeling of being boxed by fate, of wanting to lay blame at the feet of who I am now for what I had told him \u2014 words of comfort, words of despair. He looks away and takes his place in the crowd.\nThe car is seen before it is heard. Everything is leading towards that moment, the moment I have seen, heard and felt so many times.\nA figure is running towards the road. His is the first time I made this journey. The technology had worked, but not with the precision I had hoped for or relied upon. I was running to recover lost time. Running to reach the road, to stop the car, to change everything.\nBut I was not alone. There were others running towards the road. I heard them and turned, hesitating, shocked, unable to make sense of these apparitions of myself.\nI believed I had fooled causality. I had found a way to pass through the surface of the present into the past.\nAt the last moment I look away to watch the faces of the crowd. Some look, others turn. Despair is written on the younger faces. The older ones cannot be read. The air carries and thins the cries of those running towards the road.\nWe each remember the phone call, the interruption before we were due to present our paper, pulled away from the conference and weekend together that Maddie and the girls had been driving across states to reach. The hotel, the departure, the hospital, the identification.\nMoments blurred together in an instant that took forever.\nThere is nothing to be done, nothing to be said. The crowd disperses. Some linger, some rush away. Out near the road they do the same. But one of them looks to the horizon rather than the ground or the wreckage. Singled out by the sunset, he catches sight of movement, of figures on a distant rocky edge.\nI will wait for him.\nWhat has happened has always happened and always will have happened. Time is like a river, but frozen, not flowing. Eddies, pools and falls are fixed in place, timeless and immutable. Closed curves in time allow my presence here and now; temporal entanglement demands it. But the logic of time loops is self-consistent and cannot be hacked.\nI will take all this to my grave. This knowledge. This technology. This curse of impotence and reliving. The lid will close and my work and all the sadness it brings will be gone.\nThe only markers will be an early paper, unpresented, obscure and seemingly little more than speculation, and the curiosity of my cancer \u2014 a novelty and a puzzle and, eventually, a memory for the doctors who gathered round and sampled and discussed.\nI turn. He is coming up the slope.\nI cannot remember exactly what was said, but it was words of comfort, words of despair. He walks to the edge, just along from me. He looks at the wreckage and the road. He looks at me, to me. Troubled. Uncertain. Desperate. He walks over. He wants to ask. He wants to plead. He needs to know.\nI take his arm. Whatever I say will be the right thing. It will have been the same thing. Nothing can be changed. Words of comfort, words of despair.\n\u201cI know. It\u2019s OK. There is nothing you can do.\u201d","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

But six-storey structures were not easily found, not on the prairies, not at that time.\nKong\u2019s visit would change all that.\nWhen estimated building costs were made public, not a few taxpayers in not a few towns voiced fiscal misgivings. But they were finally persuaded by the argument that, if they longed to see Kong, shelter of some sort was an absolute requirement. The likelihood of prairie storms was recognized by all. Kong would be the highest moving object for miles. The promoters effortlessly conjured up the spectre of a rattled Kong scrambling to find cover beneath a lightning-riddled sky.\nAnd, in the event of Kong\u2019s electrocution, the residents were left to brood on the guilt and infamy with which they\u2019d be saddled, not to mention disposal of the massive corpse.\nSettlements were reached: the buildings \u2014 in most cases \u2014 were built, though Kong was obliged to double his appearances.\nAs was his fashion, Kong got the last word in \u2014 that the shelters be erected by railway tracks. He struggled to sleep in the dry thin air of the prairie and was soothed by the sounds of other huge and isolate creatures \u2014 even mechanical \u2014 groaning through the sometimes seeming infinite night.\nSo. Yes. Kong\u2019s shelters were built. And built very well.\nMany can still be seen to this day, across the west, though their function has changed. Prairie folks, not big on museums to some mythic passage, put the buildings back to work. These days most of them function as grain elevators.\nBut if you look closely at the inner walls of some, even now, a century later, you may make out scratchings in the wood \u2014 the work of Kong\u2019s fingernails unsettled in sleep, seeking out the sloping peak of Kilimanjaro, 8,500 miles to the southeast, the great stone beast, pillowed in fog, willing cradle to his weary bones, ancestral home he never quite reached.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Gone! Gloom about the ephemeral nature of experience? Also gone.\nOn the other hand, every citizen spent a lot of time rummaging through the labyrinthine stacks of Storage & Retrieval \u2014 no simple task, considering the chaos of each person\u2019s memories, sensations, and speculations.\nOften, it turned out that other forgotten thoughts seemed more desirable than the one the seeker wanted to locate, so it wasn\u2019t uncommon to trudge through the exit gate later and more laden-down than one had anticipated. Everyone could fully delve into their own life experience instead of scurrying across its surface like old-time movie characters running across the top of a high-speed locomotive.\nAs one commentator proclaimed, We are at last endogenous to ourselves.\nBefore long, a new psychiatric disorder became common: \u201cAnxiety when forced to spend time away from Storage & Retrieval.\u201d\nPaid S&R-leave was the first benefit people checked for with every employment package.\nAnd so many people found it convenient to schedule meetings on the premises (since they were there much of the time anyway) that Starbucks set up a network of locations throughout the facilities.\nWhen it became popular to camp out among the stacks, instantly accessing each night\u2019s dreams each morning, a host of hotels and AirBnBs sprang up; these eventually gave way to houses, then villages, and finally, cities complete with business districts, suburbs, and gated communities.\nThe outer world has become increasingly depopulated, except for a few resisters. Some are uncomfortable about the very idea of an inner life, some cultivate a spirituality of impermanence, and some are simply too impatient to engage in all that sifting and sorting \u2014 but all enjoy the luxuries of the abandoned residences and shopping malls.\nThen there\u2019s the little community in the old neighborhood that outsources their connection to their mental past. When one of them needs to retrieve a particular cognitive event, they send out a list of specifications to a day laborer who trudges to S&R to select a half-dozen or so according to the target-thought\u2019s general characteristics and hauls them back across the border to be examined. This occurs as many times as it takes; afterwards, all the near-miss thoughts are returned only slightly worn from handling.\nMost significant of all, however, are the racketeers working the shadow economy who engineer artificial cognitive data to be smuggled into Storage by stealth operatives, often middle-management double-dippers. In the early years, these counterfeits were relatively simple \u2014 a mother wanted her daughter to cherish a few brighter images of sophomore year, for instance, or a District Attorney needed several witnesses to discover a particular memory when called to the stand.\nBut as increasing numbers of consumers demanded synthetic recollections (some ordinary, some ecstatic or depraved, others ecstatic and depraved), these fictions became more and more elaborate.\nClusters of adult siblings purchased family narrative do-overs going back generations. Various interest groups used their collective buying power to purchase what came to be known as \u201cconsensual histories\u201d which themselves were subject to alteration as internal dissensions arose.\nOf course, authentic memories that contradicted fresh fabricated ones had to be identified, isolated, and destroyed by \u201cthe extricators,\u201d a network of stealth operatives who had their own profiteering structure.\nWith all these layers of financial opportunity, no one was surprised when organized crime moved in. Now the mob and the police strive to thwart each other in a sequence of intimately choreographed maneuvers; after every successful raid, more thought labs pop up behind different fronts.\nMost citizens look back on their pre-Cognitive Maintenance selves with a gratifying mixture of compassion and condescension \u2014 of course they were always misplacing all that mental content, which ranged from the previous night\u2019s dreams to great swathes of their childhoods!\nNothing could be more forgettable than the artifacts of a fixed, immutable past languishing in a solitary brain.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

I can only see numbers adding one to another.\nI read everything I can. Sometimes searching for an answer to my affliction, sometimes to keep myself preoccupied.

I focus on the good things: the woods behind the school, the way the ceiling looks as I\u2019m falling asleep, how much I enjoy wearing a uniform. I blend in with the other students. We are united if only in appearance.\nI make a few friends. Other outsiders.\nI tell one of them about my power, my curse, my whatever.\n\u201cProve it,\u201d she says. So, I make her glass disappear. The orange juice splashes all over her white pressed shirt, but she doesn\u2019t care. She is laughing wildly in exhilaration, and for the first time my brain feels like some kind of miracle.\nShe tells me to make other things disappear. A friend\u2019s kilt, a dog\u2019s leash, the bench on which a couple is making out. I do what she says. It scares me a little, but I love the feeling of camaraderie. I have never had friends before.\nWe form a group and I am the head. We call ourselves the Vanishers, and we play pranks. I disappear locks and window screens so that we can sneak out of the dorm and meet up with boys. I disappear lampposts so that we are always in the shadows. I disappear fences and gates and once an ice cream truck. But I never disappear anything alive. I have vowed never to do that again.\nXVI\nA new girl joins our group. She is small and frail and reminds me of my sister. She laughs too loudly and jumps at sudden movements.\nOne night she comes into my room and starts talking.\n\u201cMy mother,\u201d she says and shows me the purple bruises on her arms. \u201cIt happens whenever I go home. Sometimes it\u2019s only small things like a hair dryer. Last time it was a bookshelf and all the books.\u201d She stops talking and the room is missing all the air.\n\u201cI know what you can do,\u201d she says. \u201cVanish my mother.\u201d\nInstead I take her to the chaplain. Instead child services comes and takes her away. Instead she sends me glares from across the breakfast table when she returns to school, and then one day she doesn\u2019t come back at all. I don\u2019t know if I would try to contact her even if I knew how.\nAt night I dream about faceless women approaching me with hands upraised. And then I dream about Mr. Newcomer. They never had a funeral for him. There was no body.\nIn the morning I cut myself with scissors. Three little lines on my wrist as if I\u2019ve been scratched by a miniature tiger.\nXVII\nThe Vanishers disintegrate. I can\u2019t say that I am unhappy. What held us together beyond the petty crimes and the fear of getting caught?\nOr for me, the fear that one day I would go too far. I never tell the others about that. For them it is a party trick with no real ramifications.\nWe apply to colleges that are spread out across the country. I am not interested in the Ivy Leagues. I want to go somewhere quiet where I can be alone.\nMy sister is in high school now. She is everything good in my life, though I\u2019d never tell her. We\u2019re at the stage in our relationship that is half self, half enemy. She draws pictures and paints, forming shapes from nothing. And I\u2019m convinced that every boy in the school is in love with her.\nI get in a fight with my friend. I have friends now which makes life better and more difficult. She wants me to vanish the flags in the middle of graduation. I don\u2019t want to do it.\n\u201cWhy are you always so selfish?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t just a game,\u201d I say. Which is as close as I\u2019ve ever come to admitting what I\u2019ve done.\n\u201cWhatever, Cassie,\u201d she says. We don\u2019t talk up until the week of graduation, then we pretend that nothing has happened.\nI keep cutting myself every week. It is a habit now more than anything, reminding me of what is at stake, keeping me grounded. The feeling of the scissors going through my skin. I know that I am being unhealthy. I know that I am being self-centered and childish and bad. But it is my own little tether to the world and I don\u2019t want to let it go.\nThe three lines are hidden under the sleeves of my graduation gown.\nIn the audience are my mom, my sister, and miraculously, my dad. I smile at all of them. I do not wish that anyone or anything is gone. I wish instead to keep this moment perfect and whole forever.\nXX\nI go to a small college in Minnesota. I study English and biology because I need to find out how to create something from nothing. They seem the two most likely fields.\nI continue to write letters to my sister. She is in college, too, in our home state. I hope that she is happy. It is all I really hope for these days.\nI make more friends somehow. I have learned that trick well enough. I do not make the mistake of telling anyone about the vanishing. I haven\u2019t done it in years. Some days I can even forget that it\u2019s inside of me. The great void. Whatever it might be. I have given up trying to discover its origin. I believe now that it is present in everyone, and I merely unlocked it.\nI don\u2019t cut myself anymore, though the three lines remain. I take pills now, little green goblins that hop and jitter through my nervous system and keep me mostly calm and mostly happy.\nBlessed are the SSRIs for they will humble the savage brain.\nIt snows in the winter and I leave long tumbling trails behind me in the white. I am walking through the darkening trees and listening for the song of winter birds. I do not feel empty.\nThen I receive a phone call from my mom.\n\u201cYou need to call your sister,\u201d she says. \u201cSomething happened. She won\u2019t tell me what it is. She says she wants to talk to you.\u201d\nI call.\n\u201cLily,\u201d I say.\n\u201cHey, sis,\u201d she says. She is not crying, but her voice sounds hollow.\n\u201cMom said something happened?\u201d I don\u2019t really want to ask, but I need to know.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Lily says, \u201csomething.\u201d\n\u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I think I should.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she says, \u201cso, I got drunk. You know. I do that from time to time. It\u2019s college. Most people do that from time to time.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d I say.\n\u201cWell, I was with friends, but they got tired, went home, and I was crushing on this dude, so I stayed out. But then the dude left, too, and I was kind of on my own. And that\u2019s the last thing I really absolutely remember. When I woke up I, um, couldn\u2019t find my bra or my underwear. And, um, there was some bruising, you know? So I went to the hospital and got a rape check. And the nurse said that there had been, um, there had been forced penetration. Later I found out from the guys who lived next door that they had seen me going into this other guy\u2019s room and this other guy, Kevin, he plays baseball I guess, but Kevin had come out and been like \u2018I just fucked a freshman\u2019. So. So, um, I think I was sexually assaulted.\u201d\nThere is nothing else in the whole world.\n\u201cI feel so shaken,\u201d she says, \u201clike deep down. I just want it all to go away.\u201d\nI love my sister, so I hold it together until she hangs up the phone. Then I scream and scream until I lose my voice.\nI track him down. He is easy enough to find using the campus directory. He doesn\u2019t know why I\u2019m there until I begin.\nI erase his left foot first, then his right. I erase his mouth because he is being loud. I have always wondered if it hurts. Apparently it does. I erase his arms and legs. I erase his penis very very slowly. I erase his torso, his neck and finally his head. And then he is gone.\nI imagine that this will be enough. But it is not. I sit on the floor outside his dorm room shaking, until a custodian comes by and asks me if I\u2019m all right.\nXXII\nI leave school after the incident. I can\u2019t be there. I need to be with my sister. She is struggling. She says she doesn\u2019t understand any of it. She says she is trying to grow from it, but there is nowhere to grow. It\u2019s all so strange she says. She looks at me sometimes, and I think she is remembering the cat.\nFor Christmas I give her a sketchpad and coloring pencils.\n\u201cDraw me something beautiful,\u201d I say.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d\nI read all the time now. In between shifts as a waitress, I read Morrison and Alexie and Carver and Jackson. I read Atwood and Munro. I read Garcia Marquez. I read and read until I think that I could start another world.\nOne day a pair of businessmen come in for lunch.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to tell you something,\u201d one of them says to me. I hate when they talk to me. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you something that you\u2019ve never heard before,\u201d he says. \u201cYou look like a young Sissy Spacek. A young Sissy Spacek in Carrie,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean it as a compliment. She wasn\u2019t crazy, you know, or at least not to begin with. It was the world that made her crazy.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I say.\nMy sister moves out the next month. She writes me a letter.\n\u201cI think I know what you did,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cI know you were trying to protect me, but I can\u2019t live in the same house as you. I hope you\u2019ll understand. I still love you. Lily\u201d\nShe tells my mom she just needs more space.\nXXIII\nI wake up in the bed I slept in growing up. The bed I sat on when my dad left. Across the room is the bed my sister slept in. She used to throw her stuffed animals at me in the middle of the night to scare me. I used to short-sheet her bed.\nI can\u2019t get up any more. The three lines on my arm became a series of tally marks and then something like train-tracks running up to my elbow.\nThey are never very deep. Not deep enough to be serious.\nOr so I tell myself. There is nothing that can cure me. Nothing that can cure anyone. We are all down in our cores hurting. And there isn\u2019t a thing to do about it.\nSo I start erasing. I start with all the buildings. I erase the house I am in, and I am standing on nothing, my mother beneath me still in her pajamas. I work too quickly for her to be frightened.\nI erase the house next door, the house beyond that, then with a single sweep, I erase the whole town. There is nothing but birds and trees, and people in various states of disorder. I erase them all, too. I pull the world closer to me in every direction so that mile by mile it is disappearing. I disintegrate the state, I dissolve the country, I vanish the continent. It is so silent. It is so easy. It is so quick.\nI disappear Paris and Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo and all the places in between.\nGood-bye to the Great Barrier Reef and to penguins and to kiwis, to the deep-sea angler fish.\nGood-bye to Mount Everest, Mount Kilimanjaro, the Pyramids, the Great Wall of China.\nFarewell to Eskimos and Maoris and white people and brown people and caramel people.\nEvery piece of art, gone, every book ever written gone, all the sounds and sights and weapons all the hatred and wonder, gone.\nEveryone I ever knew: all the kids from elementary school wherever they landed, my Sunday school teacher, the Vanishers from high school, the young girl and her abusive mother, the professors in college, those I had and those I didn\u2019t, the man in the restaurant and Sissy Spacek.\nI wish they were not there. And they are not there.\nI erase the planet, then the sun, then the galaxy, then the universe.\nIt is just me now. And Lily. I could not bring myself to erase her. Not yet. She is looking at me. I have never seen that expression on her face before. Her eyes are so blue.\nIt is quiet where we are. Quiet and bright. Only silence audible.\nThen I disappear her, too.\nNow\nIt is only me. I am alone. There is nowhere to move to and no time to tell it in. All I have is my brain and the infinite games it plays.\nI remember the things I hated. Racist old people and apathetic young people and babies crying on airplanes and parents angrily shushing them. I remember the things I loved. Early mornings when it was only me and the birds, late nights talking to friends, playing with Lily in our backyard, building huts out of twigs and leaves.\nI am so lonely.\nI have vanished everything except the void. The great void that I see now has always and only ever been inside me. A black hole cavernous enough to consume the world.\nI don\u2019t know when I discover the secret, the secret to recreate, not with a bang, but with a word. Given enough time monkeys will recreate Shakespeare and I am at least a little brighter than a monkey.\nI speak, and as I do I feel myself splitting open and all the great and awful beauty of the universe spills back out. It has all the time been inside of me, too.\nAnd I am five years old again, teasing a cat with my sister in the long grass of an Indiana summer.\nAnd perhaps we can start again.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Just like she\u2019s always had better hair and less of a weight problem. She gets it all from her mom I guess. That\u2019s what\u2019s funny, I\u2019m the one who looks like our dad \u2014 same nose, same frizz to my hair. Not that it does me any good. When he looks at me maybe he sees himself, but when he looks at her, he sees a princess.\nShe can do no wrong for him, which I guess is why she can do no right as far as my mom is concerned. My mom is a piece of work, I will be the first one to admit that, but when it comes to my stepsister, I don\u2019t blame her that much. How would you deal with a third daughter who looks just like your husband\u2019s ex?\nAnd Cindy is not the easiest person to be around. She\u2019s sweet-natured, definitely, but she\u2019s a bit scattered. She wasn\u2019t the only one with chores to do. I did mine on time and she spent an hour staring at the birds and my mom \u2014 like I said, my mom is my mom, she gets angry. She totally lost it, she told Cindy she was grounded, forget about the dance.\nHonestly, it didn\u2019t seem like she even wanted to go that badly, she just kind of nodded her head and went back to talking to the birds, or whatever.\nI was excited though. I had been dieting all month, I straightened out my hair and put it up, I even had these kitten heels that made me feel so sexy, even though I could barely walk.\nI danced with him. I couldn\u2019t believe it. He is just as charming as everyone says. He held my elbow when we walked into the ballroom and put one hand in the middle of my back and the other on my shoulder. I could tell he was just being polite, though. Not like when he danced with her.\nThat was all I thought about when I noticed she was there. Not how she got out of the house or what my mom was going to do, or even where the dress came from. The way he was looking at her. Like she was a plate of food and he was starving. Like he had just found a $100 bill laying on the ground. She could have told him to turn around and jump out the window and he would have done it, I swear.\nI tried to dance with some other boys but I couldn\u2019t focus. I kept looking over at him and every time I did he was with her, standing in the corner with his hand on the wall above her head. I saw her laughing at something he said, and when I looked over again they were reading each other\u2019s palms.\nI went home early. I didn\u2019t know anything about what happened until the next day. Mom was being weird. She didn\u2019t yell at Cindy, she didn\u2019t even look mad, she just seemed preoccupied, like she was doing a math problem in her head.\nShe was the one who told me about the shoe. I know it\u2019s crazy, but the way she explained it to me it made sense. She said it could be my chance with him, if I was just brave enough. Maybe he would be upset at first, but he would see, he would understand later how he\u2019d made the right choice.\nShe took me into the bathroom. Not the guest bathroom, the one Cindy was supposed to clean, but the master bath, the one she and Dad use.\nShe put a pile of old towels on the floor and laid out everything we would need. She had the big knife from the kitchen, the one Dad uses to carve up the chicken on Sundays. She said it was sharp, she\u2019d made sure, and that it would be over quickly.\nShe held my left foot in place, with a cotton ball to keep my pinkie toe separate like when we did pedicures. I screamed so hard I thought I would black out, but it was over already.\nShe was wrapping up my foot up and telling me to hold still. All I could do was lie there with her arms around me, trying to catch my breath.\n\u201cThe prince,\u201d she said, stroking my hair. \u201cJust think about your prince.\u201d\nWhen I was ready, she held my hand and walked me downstairs. He was in our kitchen, drinking a cup of coffee and talking with Dad. He looked different in the daylight, irritated maybe. Impatient.\nHe had the shoe with him on a little velvet pillow, this beautiful white-satin thing with a six-inch heel and diamonds on the ankle strap. He looked me up and down when I walked in and squinted a little. I pulled my stomach in tight and pushed my chest out, holding my shoulders back just like Mom showed me.\nHe pulled out a chair and I sat. Mom was already reaching for the shoe. She said something to him, a joke maybe, so that he wouldn\u2019t look down while she was putting it on me. A perfect fit! She shouted and he got down on his knees right there on the kitchen floor so he could see.\nI stretched my leg out to show him, and when he looked up I saw something in his eyes, a gleam, like he was seeing me somewhere else. Maybe in a sexy dress, or even with no clothes on at all.\nI will make you so happy. I thought. I will do anything for you, anything you want.\nAnd then I ruined it. My heart was beating so fast. When my foot started tingling I thought I was just excited, but then I felt something wet oozing out of the shoe and his mouth fell open, like the kitchen was water and he was drowning in it.\nI tried to take it off. I thought maybe if he saw that I could be honest with him he would understand it.\nBut he looked away. He just looked away like I wasn\u2019t there anymore.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

If I tell it to you, you have to believe it, because if you don\u2019t believe it, the Oogaloogaman will get you.\nWe don\u2019t know if he has teeth, or an axe, or eyes that glow red in the night, because none of us has ever seen him. That\u2019s because we believe in him.\nOne of the rules is, if you don\u2019t believe in him, I can\u2019t talk to you, cause if I do the Oogaloogaman will get me.\nIf you don\u2019t want to hear, then you have to get up right now and go sit away from the fire.\nSo I guess all of you want to hear it. It\u2019s better if you do anyway, because if you don\u2019t you might do something that makes the Oogaloogaman mad, and if you make him mad, he\u2019ll get you.\nHere are the rules about knowing about the Oogaloogaman \u2014 Jeremy, what? No: first you have to know the rules. Then you can hear the story. That\u2019s the way it has always been. If you don\u2019t like it you can go sit in the woods. And just see if anyone wants to sit with you.\nSo. Here are the rules. If you believe in the Oogaloogaman, you can\u2019t step on cracks. You can\u2019t step on somebody else\u2019s shadow, and if you pass a well you have to drop a rock in it, and if there\u2019s no rocks, you have to walk in a circle around it and say, \u201cButter bread, butter bread, butter bread,\u201d three times in a row, like that.\nAnd if you cross a creek at night, you have to walk backwards.\nLewis, I said no going to the bathroom until the rules are finished. Well you can go in the woods if you have to so bad. But nobody\u2019s going with you.\nAlways write on lined paper with the fat part at the top, never upside down. If you\u2019re filling a glass from the sink, always hold it in your left hand. If the glass already has ice that\u2019s extra luck. Don\u2019t eat snow after dark. Don\u2019t touch your eyes in a graveyard. Don\u2019t \u2014 what?\nIf you make me forget a rule, you\u2019ll break it and the Oogaloogaman will get you. Yes he will! And don\u2019t even say he won\u2019t as a joke, because he\u2019ll get you if he even thinks you don\u2019t believe in him.\nPeter talked until the fire went out, and the moon came up bright enough to see the trees. Jeremy kept crying even after Peter showed him how you could see there were no eyes in the trees.\nJake said shut up cause the Oogaloogaman would hear the crying and then he really would get them.\nI was sitting by the fire pit, where the rocks were still warm. I remember the moon was so bright I could draw in the dirt with a stick and see it.\nJason went up to Peter and said, What about holding your breath on a full moon?\nWhat about it, said Peter.\nMy brother said if you do the Ooglaoogaman can come out of the moon and get you.\nIt\u2019s not a full moon.\nSo? You still forgot.\nI wasn\u2019t holding my breath. No I wasn\u2019t! No I wasn\u2019t!\nPeter started crying and shoved Jason, then Jim, who was the oldest, made them stop, and said, It\u2019s not a full moon, cause he his mom said it was full yesterday, and anyway Peter was lucky, Jason said so, cause if there were extra rules, it was better if we knew them.\nPeter said it wasn\u2019t true, but Jim said Peter had to say Jason believed in the Oogaloogaman, cause if he didn\u2019t say it the Oogaloogaman would get Peter for talking to Jason, and if Jason believed in the Oogaloogaman getting you if you held your breath on a full moon, then that had to be true, too.\nAnd anyway even if it wasn\u2019t true \u2014 and nobody was saying so, just if it wasn\u2019t \u2014 what would you rather do, not hold your breath on a full moon, or let the Oogaloogaman get you.\nSo in the end everyone swore never to hold our breaths on a full moon, and if we saw anyone doing it we would hit him in the stomach as hard as we could so he would have to breathe out before the Oogaloogaman saw it.\nThen Lewis started crying and Jim took him to pee and everyone got in their sleeping bags but I didn\u2019t sleep all night.\nAnother time, I was behind the barn finding rocks with Jasper. He said if you touch left elbows with a girl you will get a wart on that elbow. He asked me to swear I believed it.\nI swore.\nThen his mom called and said we had play with his little brothers.\nWe went down to the creek.\nWanna hear a story? I said.

First, he was very curious looking. He had two tiny black eyes (good for seeing in the dark), two tiny hands with four sharp claws each (good for digging holes and tunnels) and a tiny body covered with soft brown fur, good for keeping him warm wherever he might go.\nThe second way he was curious was \u2026 well, just that: He was very, very curious. He wanted to see everything there was to see and go everywhere there was to go. When he was young he would use his sharp claws to tunnel right underneath the back garden fence to explore the green fields and hills that lay beyond.\nHis mother used to call for him: \u201cMawulf? Oh, Mawulf? Where ARE you NOW?!\u201d\nAnd Mawulf would poke his head out of a tunnel, a tunnel he had dug to the top of a hill on the other side of their valley, and call back, \u201cI am way over here, Mama, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll come back soon.\u201d\nBut his Mother did worry, for everyday Mawulf went further and further away from home.\nOne morning, at breakfast, she said to him, \u201cI worry about you, my young explorer. Everyday you dig your holes far and far and then far some more. I fear one day you may dig so far that you will dig your way completely through this world and fall right off.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Mama,\u201d said Mawulf, \u201cThere is plenty of world to dig and I want explore. I want to burrow to strange new places and meet strange new people. They will tell me of the life of them and I will tell them of the life of me. I will tell them of the newness of our land. I will tell them about the stars in our sky. And, of course, I will tell them all about the many delicious types of Breakfast Cereal we may choose to eat in the morning-time.\u201d\nYou see, children, this may seem strange to you, but in Mawulf\u2019s land breakfast was taken very seriously, being regarded as the most important meal of the day. Also, they were accustomed to a choice when it came to the cereal one ate in the morning \u2014 and Mawulf\u2019s people were very proud of their cereals. There were cereals made of wheat and corn and oats, cereals that tasted sweet and savory and of fruit and chocolate, cereals of all colors and cereals of all shapes. Hundreds of combinations available each and every sun-blessed morning \u2026\nThe sky was bright with smiling clouds on the day Mawulf left to explore the world. To dig his way to all the wonderful places he had longed to see ever since he was young.\n\u201cSo, I am off to see the world Mama,\u201d said Mawulf. \u201cWish me well.\u201d\n\u201cI do wish you well,\u201d said his Mother, \u201cBut always remember, when you meet new people be sure to be polite. Tell them of our cereal, but also, ask them of their cereal. Give them stories of our Pops and Crispies, of our Chockula and Wheat Frosties but make sure you hear their stories, as well, because sharing is just as important as digging, you know.\u201d\nHis Mother reached across the breakfast table and held his tiny claws in hers, \u201cBe careful, my young explorer, she said, \u201cYou are wise for one so young but the world is both a very big and a very small place. Dig both deep and shallow and always remember the difference between the two.\u201d\n\u201cOh Mama, you worry so,\u201d laughed Mawulf. \u201cThe world awaits and there is so much to know. I will tunnel far and far and far again. In the Land of After-Sea, I will ask of Mirrors. In the Island Kingdoms, I will ask of Origins. In the Giant Land, I will ask of many things \u2026of Clocks and Stones and Colors and Faces. On the Mountain Top-ness, I will ask of Done-ness and When-ness and Now-ness. When I find the Oldest Orchard, I will ask of Me. Wish me luck, Mama. Good-by!\u201d\nAnd with a final wave, Mawulf burrowed into the ground to find the world.\nAnd Mawulf did find the world. He dug his way to many bizarre and wonderful places. He also met many bizarre and wonderful people. It seemed that every time he popped his head up from the ground in some strange new land he would make a new friend.\nOne day he met a small dog.\n\u201cGood morning, new friend Dog,\u201d said Mawulf with a polite bow, \u201cI come from a land where we have many delicious types of Breakfast Cereal to choose from. It is a pleasure to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cGood morning and a pleasant bark to you, new friend,\u201d said the Dog. \u201cIt is a pleasure to meet you, too. In my land we have many delicious types of cheese and meat and rolls and bacon. Although breakfast is a very fine meal indeed, we prefer lunch.\u201d\n\u201cThank you for telling me of your home and food,\u201d replied Mawulf, \u201cBut there is much to see so I must dig again now and be on my way. Good-by, friend Dog.\u201d\nAnd with that Mawulf tunneled away.\nOne day he met a small cat.\n\u201cGood morning, new friend Cat,\u201d said Mawulf with a polite bow, \u201cI come from a land where we have many delicious types of Breakfast Cereal to choose from. It is a pleasure to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cGood morning and a pleasant meow to you, new friend,\u201d said the Cat. \u201cIt is a pleasure to meet you, too. In my land we have many delicious types of bread and sauce and wine and noodles. Although breakfast is a very fine meal indeed, we prefer dinner.\u201d\n\u201cThank you for telling me of your home and food,\u201d replied Mawulf, \u201cBut there is much to see so I must dig again now and be on my way. Good-by, friend Cat.\u201d\nAnd with that Mawulf tunneled away.\nAnd so it went. Mawulf had many fine adventures and met many new friends.\nMawulf was so excited and so happy with his exploring that began to dig faster and faster. He wanted to see everything, everything, everything there was to see.\nHe became so worried that he wouldn\u2019t be able to see it all that he tunneled quicker, quicker, quicker and went farther, farther, farther.\nFaster and faster and faster he dug and dug and dug, until \u2026\nWell, this is when our story gets a bit sad, children. So if you need to stop reading, do it now.\nAs we all know, Moon hides underneath the horizon of Earth when Sun comes up to play. Moon nestles up to Earth, hugging the rim, waiting for the night.\nAnd that\u2019s where Moon was, snuggling Earth all cozy, on that fateful day when Mawulf did what his Mother had warned him about so many years ago. He tunneled his way right through the world and popped out the other side!\nHe would have fallen right off, too, into outer space, just like his Mama said, if Moon wasn\u2019t there, snug against the Earth.\nBut he was digging so fast that he didn\u2019t even realize he had left Earth and was really digging through Moon instead. Eventually, he dug right through Moon as well!\nMawulf poked out his head. There were absolutely no people anywhere, nothing but a starry, starry sky. He was very confused.\n\u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d Mawulf called, echoingly. \u201cHello? Would anyone like to chat about Breakfast Cereals? Hello?\u201d Puzzled, he went back the way he came, through his tunnel and popped his head out. But strangely, there were no people to be found there, either.\n\u201cHello? Hello,\u201d he called. But no one called back.\nYou see, it was late: Moon had already moved towards Night and was high in the sky. All the people that Mawulf knew were far, far away on the world below.\n\u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d he echoed. \u201cHello? I come from the land of a tasty and nutritious breakfast? Hello?\u201d\nHe was quite perplexed.\nYou must understand, children, that Mawulf never realized he was actually on Moon. He reckoned he had only dug too far in this world, to some strange and barren place. He tried digging new tunnels, desperate to get home, but every time he poked his head out he seemed no closer to where he needed to be.\nFaster and faster he dug. Faster and faster.\nHe dug so many tunnels that Moon, being so full of holes, began to disappear.\nFirst a quarter of Moon went away \u2026 then a half \u2026 then almost all \u2026 until \u2026 there was nothing left of Moon but one big hole in the sky.\nNow as sad and lonely as Mawulf was, he still remembered what his Mother always said about being polite, no matter where you go. Mawulf figured that even though there were no people to complain, it would be very rude to leave nothing but one gigantic hole, no matter where one may be.\nSo he began to fill the holes back in. First a quarter was filled up, then half, then \u2026 after some time, Moon was all back again.\nHard work it was, it took him a whole month. When he was finished, Mawulf looked around and called out, \u201cHello, hello?\u201d\nBut still, he could see no people.\n\u201cFiddlesticks,\u201d he sighed, \u201cI guess I dug the wrong way. I suppose I shall have to start again. Maybe this time I will find my way home.\u201d Once again he dug and dug and dug until there was no more Moon left in the sky. And once again \u2026 he filled it all back up.\n\u201cHello, hello?\u201d\nBut he was still no closer to home.\n\u201cFiddlesticks, I guess I must try again.\u201d\nSo it goes, children, even to this day, every month Mawulf digs away Moon, then fills it all in again, looking for home.\nBut don\u2019t be sad, children, for Mawulf made many new friends on his journey. They all miss him dearly and want to help him find his way back.\nSo if you ever hear a dog howling at the moon (\u201cMaaawuuulwoooooooof!!\u201d) or a cat screeching at midnight (\u201cMeeeowulfrreeeech!!\u201d) \u2026 don\u2019t be scared.\nIt\u2019s only Mawulf\u2019s friends calling out to him up in the sky, trying to guide him home.\nAnd if you listen very carefully, you may even hear his Mother\u2019s voice riding on the nighttime wind:\n\u201cMawulf? Oh, Mawulf? Where ARE you NOW?!\u201d\nAdam Myers is an artist, writer and educator based in Seoul, South Korea, and an MFA from the San Francisco Art Institute.

In this sweetly told flash fiction there is, at least, something very close.","hostname":"fabulistmagazine.com","source":"https:\/\/fabulistmagazine.com\/falling-action-cafe\/","sitename":"The Fabulist Words & Art","text":"I\u2019ve lived in many places, but I want to stay forever at the Falling Action Caf\u00e9.\nA little bell tinkles when customers trail in, and the owner, Frieda, beams every time. She helps them find that unknown book they long for: a Victorian romance with overtones of forbidden pleasure, an action adventure with a clever detective at the heart of it all, or rough-and-tumble splatterpunk with solar-powered rollerblades and neon dreams.\nFor our part, we love being discovered. Frieda matches us with the perfect reader, that one who holds us with interest and turns our pages with excitement. Sometimes, that person comes back to read us again, and again \u2014 for, of course, they can\u2019t take us out of the caf\u00e9.\nWe call these people \u201centhusiasts.\u201d I have five.\nThe first hundred or so times someone held me in the Falling Action, my binding cringed and pulled away. Before Frieda found me, my owner had left me out in the rain in the yard, and I couldn\u2019t help but think that these people would take me out of the store and leave me as well. One time, one of the enthusiasts offered to buy me, and all my pages shook.\nFrieda refused outright. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a bookstore,\u201d she told the enthusiast. \u201cThis is a bookrest.\u201d\nI relaxed after that. I stopped tensing up when new people picked me up and carried me around.\nBesides Frieda\u2019s recommendations, the customers come here for the hidden nooks. That\u2019s what the Falling Action is all about, Frieda says. Getting away. Decompressing. Traveling to other worlds without the stress of plane tickets and packed bags. Just the pure, undiluted feeling of Being Somewhere Else. The bookshelves stretch almost to the ceilings and they stop in unexpected places.\nA cozy alcove bench. Upstairs, with the overlook and the octagon window. Through an archway where the rocking chair waits, with the little stand to set a mug down.\nStacks of us also line the little places between one bookshelf and the next to save space. Frieda knows everyone\u2019s location, even tucked at the bottom of a stack. She knows us.\nIf customers want to nibble on a stroopwafel and dunk it in some cocoa, we have those things, too. Frieda just cautions them to not stain our pages. That makes us happy, that trust she has, and we all try to protect it. If a non-book-lover wanders in, they leave within a few minutes. Our smell of paper and ink, and the lost, meandering effect we create tends to clash with those who don\u2019t care that they left crumbs as uncomfortable bookmarks.\nFor their part, the customers say that they feel transported. Each person, after all, exists as a kind of setting, a location, a place in the world. I can understand that. I love being taken out and held in different hands. Oh, I love it when their eyes widen, and when they make that little gasp on page 37! That\u2019s when I know I\u2019ve gained another enthusiast.\nBut the best thing about the Falling Action Caf\u00e9 remains Frieda, herself. She\u2019s read me on Friday nights, late, in the alcove with the bench. She\u2019s held me with more tenderness than I\u2019ve known since my author created me. She took the time to press my rain-damaged, wrinkled pages down, smoothing out the worst of my warped shape. She sewed part of my binding that had come loose. She gave me a home, instead of selling me to someone who could have hurt me again.\nEvery one of my fellows reports the same. Frieda\u2019s an enthusiast for all of us, as impossible as it seems. Whether we were scorched in fires, or had pages ripped out or eaten by insects, for each of us, she did what she could.\nI\u2019ve come to understand that this place is not made for the humans who come in, but for us books. I wonder, sometimes, if this caf\u00e9 is what heaven might give to the ascended printed page.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Her body sprawled unnaturally at the foot of the bed with scattered yellow and pink and white pills littering the raw linen coverlet.\nThe multitudinous silk throw pillows sat untouched and nicely fluffed at the top.\nShe was very dead.\nSnapdragons were her favorite flowers and a freshly arranged pot of them in yellow and pink and white tones cried in the corner.\n\u201cShe was such a happy girl.\u201d\n\u201cWe never knew.\u201d\n\u201cShe never said anything.\u201d\n\u201cShe arranged us with such precision, such care.\u201d\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t seem crazy.\u201d\n\u201cI need more water.\u201d\nThe silent room waited for decomposition. Her body unfortunately emptied itself and slowly seeped, embedding her urine in the mattress. The bed didn\u2019t mind, per se. It knew her.\nYet the lonely pillows only knew her smell, and longed for other heads and bodies to wrap themselves around their downy fillings.\nMegan had longed for the same. She often complained to the listening air about her lonely vagina and listed her wants in a mate.\nMore than sex, she desperately wanted someone to hold through the night. She wanted to nuzzle her nose in his neck and enwrap him in her arms. She wanted to laugh out loud.\n\u201cHe has to be funny. He has to get my brand of humor. He has to like bacon.\u201d\nHer list was short; she didn\u2019t demand much, but they never fulfilled. She knew she could have sex with most men, but craved respect.\nShe never brought them back to her pristine haven if she questioned their accountability. She didn\u2019t like washing her 400 thread-count sheets more than once a week. She worried about breaking down the fibers \u2014 and it\u2019s practically impossible to get semen out of silk.\nThe pillows thankfully agreed.\nSunlight poured through the puffy window swag and bathed her dead body in striated magical light. She almost looked alive. She would not be discovered for three days.\nThree days later, thoughts burbled up from the cubical walls as her coworkers gossiped about the event that would be forgotten in less than a month; no one cried at the office.\n\u201cShe was such a happy girl.\u201d\n\u201cWe never knew.\u201d\n\u201cShe never said anything.\u201d\n\u201cShe worked with such precision, such care.\u201d\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t seem crazy.\u201d\n\u201cI need more water.\u201d\nGopher heads popped up above their shortened walls among the buzzing computers and plastic flowers.\n\u201cDid she say anything Friday?\u201d\n\u201cDid she eat lunch alone?\u201d\n\u201cSomeone must know something.\u201d\n\u201cShe liked Pottery Barn catalogues and read them in the break room over lunch.\u201d\n\u201cAlone?\u201d\n\u201cShe was always alone, by choice.\u201d\n\u201cNever went out to happy hour.\u201d\n\u201cWeird. Did anyone see the signs?\u201d\nMegan left no signs. She worked diligently and refused to call attention to herself at the office. Work was work. Work was for money. She derived no joy from numbers and phone calls and angry cat ladies yelling about \u201cfull coverage.\u201d\nMegan\u2019s real life was secret, and she needed grand separation between work and play.\nShe purposely made sure no one knew her and flew silently under the radar.\nMegan liked drugs.\n\u201cDani trabajo aqui?\u201d She ran from shop to shop in Mexico looking for the infamous Dani.\nShe heard from a guy at the taco shop that he was willing to sell Oxys and Flexural and Ritalin and Aderol and maybe a spot of coke and Valium for a buck a pill.\nOxys were significantly more expensive, but worth the drive across the border.\nMegan was a mule.\nTaking orders for all, she ran down to TJ once a month in pants without pockets, two pair of underwear and clean American smile. The border guards never suspected the bouncy little redhead held hundreds of little yellow and pink and white pills rolled in plastic baggies discretely tucked between undies.\nThey were never looking for her. The guards had their eyes on shifty men with baggy pants or fakely pregnant women hiding kilos of coke under flowered mumus. Cute, thirtysomething, obvious Americans weren\u2019t on the manifest; she slid through unscathed every time.\nRoaming in and out of sterile mirrored pharmacies desperately seeking Dani, Megan played her part. She was a darling, white-toothed American girl looking for a few recreational drugs.\nHer favorite former pharmacist disappointed the last three trips. She crossed the border with a belly full of churros and no pills. Customers disappointedly looked elsewhere and Meg didn\u2019t get to drink whisky at her favorite bar that week.\nThis monetary side project was necessary to support her secret rock-and-roll life style. Project Management just didn\u2019t pay, and the commission checks were light this quarter.\nShe was looking for a new pharmaceutical safe zone, and the bald, heavily tattooed Mexican with the 42 emblazoned on his lower lip seemed trustworthy. She liked the number 42 and trusted the Virgin Mary colorfully marking the side of his head.\nHe would know where to get drugs.\nShe flittered up with hands clasped behind her back batting lashes coquettishly: \u201cHey, do you know which pharmacy will sell me some Ritalin without a prescription?\u201d\n\u201cQue?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for drugs.\u201d Her eyes gleamed and cheeks crunched with genuine smile.\nA dangerous grin split his face as he flipped open a cell phone and made a call. Megan knew no Spanish, but intently attempted to decipher. She heard \u201cbonita\u201d and \u201cloco\u201d and \u201cputa.\u201d\nPretty. Crazy. Whore.\nMegan was not offended. He was finding her drugs.\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking for Dani. Go to Revoluc\u00edon, right side. About three blocks in. Ask for Dani. Dani trabajo aqui? Can you remember? Please repeat.\u201d\n\u201cDani trabajo aqui?\u201d\n\u201cBueno.\u201d\n\u201cGracias, se\u00f1or.\u201d\nHe turned back to his tattooed brethren in baggy pants.\nFinding things was easy for Megan. No one expects the tiny redhead to be involved in underhanded dealings. No one suspects the little smiling sweetheart.\nAn astute actor and a pathological liar, she went pro on the Imposter Circuit in 1998.\nShe made her way down the busy street past the zebrafied donkey and 2 x 1 margarita specials. She easily passed kissy-faced men peddling their overpriced Mexican silver, and refused the urchin offers for Chiclets and hair braiding.\nMegan was not a tourist; she was on a mission.\nSeven pharmacies later, Megan found no elusive \u201cDani.\u201d He did not seem to \u201ctrabajo\u201d anywhere, and her thoughts began drifting into churros.\nSweet crunchy deep fried churros might be her only souvenir, again.\nHer once-productive side business would be closing its doors forever with her inventory and supply cut off. She damned the \u201cHomeland Security\u201d tightening rules and cursed at a skittering cockroach.\nThis would be her last effort.\n\u201cDani trabajo aqui?\u201d She questioned half heartedly. Her cheeks hurt from smiling. Her act slipped. She meant to wink and smile and bounce, but could no longer hold the charade.\n\u201cNo, no Dani. What do you need?\u201d\nHe opened the door.\n\u201cRitalin and Valium?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust you, American.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust you, Mexican.\u201d\nHe tentatively pressed his hand into hers and shook. \u201cWe don\u2019t trust each other. How many?\u201d\nShe smiled genuine, and pulled a folded paper from her pocket. He smiled genuine, as his family would be eating well for the next month.\nMegan found it best not to tell everyone everything. Withheld truth is not lying.\nShe practiced avoidance and mastered silence. She didn\u2019t care if people labeled her smug. She wasn\u2019t a quiet person, but it\u2019s best to be wordless if faced with the necessity to lie.\nMegan had a lot to hide. Double life can be rough on the soul.\nRemembering what you said to who, contemplating how much to reveal to which individuals, knowing who to trust and how far \u2014 these concepts rolled about in her brain, clanging on the edges of sanity.\nMegan was plagued with headaches. The white pills helped significantly.\nShe tried not to indulge in her own pills; drug addicts make bad business people, and this was a business. Megan supplied happy pills to a small contingency for money, and dipping into her stash cut profits significantly. She had other habits to attend to.\nShe liked to joke about whores and the dog track, claiming she would give them up for Lent, but it was whisky (not whores) and horses (not dogs) that plagued her thinning Brighton pocketbook.\nShe slept with her two favorite boyfriends, Jim and Mark, bottled next to the bed. Jim Beam was the only man who truly understood her and had no qualms about a threesome with Maker\u2019s Mark. They got along famously with the other men in her life, Johnny and Jack (Walker and Daniels, respectively), and made Megan feel warm and loved inside.\nThey snuggled her nightly and didn\u2019t douse the bed with unwanted man juice or errant pubic hair.\nMegan liked to keep things clean, and liked to keep her life in separate boxes. She liked to know where her tax return from 1998 was filed. She liked her buttons stapled to paper and alphabetized. She had no junk drawer. Organized to a fault, Megan believed every item had a specific home.\nMegan knew she had a problem when she started betting over televised races.\nInitially, she claimed to enjoy the smell of the track; she liked to look at the horses and judge by the musculature she pretended to understand from her days collecting plastic horses.\nShe always loved horses. Her parents promised to buy her one when they moved far from the city. They took away her friends and her life and her stability in exchange for a promise.\nShe agreed, they moved, but the promised horse never arrived. She kneeled bedside, pretending to pray to an invisible god she didn\u2019t believe in loudly enough for her parents to hear.\n\u201cPlease God, let my parents not be liars. Let them buy me a horse.\u201d\nShe watched \u201cInternational Velvet\u201d every weekend. She hung around Joe\u2019s Feed and Tack Barn looking at pictures and pulling flyers to send to her parents in the mail without signature or return address.\nHer obsession grew daily. She named her plastic horses and lined them up on self-built shelving around her room. She drew exquisite horses on the wall by amber night light after bedtime.\nPushing her bed from the wall, she sat cross-legged with markers in hand, flowing detailed colors into hindquarter muscles and shimmering waves into manes and tails.\nHer lack of sleep evident, she napped and drooled over horse doodles in class.\nShe needed her horse; it never came.\nMegan wore hats at the races. She stood along the rail and yelled at the horses and tiny jockeys in bright satin garb.\nShe often picked winners based on the colors alone; Megan was partial to yellow and pink and white and often matched her hats to the colors that felt lucky for the day.\nShe loved the adrenalin force as they took the back stretch, knowing that she could win or lose. That feeling was worth more than money to Megan. She felt alive.\nMegan was lucky, in the beginning. She couldn\u2019t lose.\nPicking numbers from tarot cards or street signs that popped out on the way to the track or dreams or the color of the man\u2019s shirt three rows back, Megan\u2019s system of no system won her money. Money made her momentarily happy as she ticked items off her list of wants:\n\u2022 Down comforter\n\u2022 Silk window treatments\n\u2022 Cashmere Pashmina throw\n\u2022 Matching Tiffany-style lamps\n\u2022 Hand-woven wool rug from Pakistan\n\u2022 Pottery Barn bathroom vanity collection in white\n\u2022 Set of eight matching tea cups with saucers\n\u2022 Silver Tiffany bracelet\n\u2022 New laptop\n\u2022 50-inch HDTV\n\u2022 Yellow KitchenAid mixer\n\u2022 Pink bathrobe\n\u2022 White 400 thread count Egyptian cotton sheets\n\u2022 Boyfriend\n\u201cWhy am I still on the list?\u201d her never-boyfriend whispered from the note.\n\u201cBecause you hate me,\u201d answered Megan. \u201cI have too many secrets and can\u2019t buy you in a store.\u201d\nShe pinned him to her bathroom mirror and re-read him every morning. She added one thing to him every time stuff was crossed off.\nThings and stuff were important to Megan; she had little else to fill time with. She was lonely but surrounded by things \u2014 expensive things. Stuff to build pride from.\nNo one ever saw her prized things; she never invited men in to see her stuff.\nMegan liked men. Actually, she loved them. She had all their greatest hits, including \u201cYou\u2019re too Crazy for Me\u201d and \u201cWhy Won\u2019t You Just Shut Up and Suck my Dick.\u201d\nThey took her home from bars, many men, and she held and loved them as long as they would let her. They never called. They were transient things, stuff to hold onto for a little while, but she smashed them into crystal bits and cut her feet walking to her car the next morning.\nShe never stayed for orange juice.\nShe refused to count her number. She figured it over 40, possibly into the 60 range, maybe over 100.\nShe always used protection and was free of disease. Megan liked things clean; she always fucked on top to avoid whomever\u2019s droplets of sweat.\nMegan rarely had orgasms. Too distracted by errant body hair or unbalanced items in single men\u2019s rooms, she often rearranged furniture before she slunk out the front door into the grey morning.\nPushing sofas on angles, re-stacking bookshelves, straitening rugs, folding laundry, she usually took out old newspapers to the recycle bin.\nShe attributed their not calling to her strange post-coital behaviors; if they\u2019d let her fold laundry before sex, she might have cum.\nIt took her less than thirty-three seconds when alone.\n\u201cYou got my fucking drugs or what?\u201d\nShe quizzically squenched her face, \u201cNot if you talk to me like that.\u201d\n\u201cI want my drugs!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to want things, dear. Builds character.\u201d\nMegan became very calm when verbally attacked; she learned this technique through years of customer service. She ran the angry phone gauntlet daily and knew how to deal with the crazy, enraged souls crackling on the other end of the line.\nGerry taunted Meg for weeks about his stash. She made a judgment call in cutting him off. He took too many, re-ordered too often.\nShe would supply for recreation, but refused to play party to his suicide.\nShe was a good drug dealer: no kids, no addicts, no pregnant ladies. She had rules and boundaries, limits and structure, holding fast to her ambiguous moral compass.\n\u201cSeriously. I need that shit, Penny.\u201d\nMegan used pseudonyms with her clients. She answered to Jenny, Penny, Peggy, Pammy, Cammy and Sue. She liked names ending in \u201cY.\u201d They bounced off the tongue and made her sound younger and cuter than she believed herself to be.\nShe had a different cell phone number with separate bill for her dealings. She carefully marked her profits and knew the expense of her business. She never dealt from her home.\nMegan was clean and careful. Work was work. Business was business. Sex was sex. Bars were bars. Betting was betting. Every detail stapled to a small cardboard backing, buttons color coded and lined in a box just so.\nHer mother collected buttons.\nAt approximately three years of age, at approximately three in the afternoon, little Meggy Poo Poo sat in the center of the floor surrounded by yellow and pink and white buttons.\nCardboard backing littering the floor around her chubby baby legs, she tossed the buttons into the air and laughed and cackled and giggled and shook her little red curls playfully.\nHer mother turned the corner down the stairs. Screaming, she tossed little Meggy across the room and attended to her beloved buttons.\n\u201cHow could you? You filthy brat! Look!\u201d\n*slap\n*cries\n\u201cYou want something to cry about?! I\u2019ll give you something to cry about!\u201d\n*slap\nLittle Meggy Poo Poo stopped crying. She never cried again.\nNot when her mother hovered over her feet with a hammer screaming about buttons and slamming toenails into floors, or threw hot potatoes at her head during dinner because she brought her favorite pink little pony to the table. Not even when her mother put dirty dishes in Megan\u2019s bed or threw her clothing out the second story window into the pond.\nMegan learned not to cry. She learned to compartmentalize feelings and ideas. She learned that being quiet is better than talking. She learned how to lie to herself.\n\u201cMother, I\u2019d like to take my horses.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t. I threw them away when you left for college.\u201d\n\u201cYou what?\u201d Megan almost started crying. She recently completed the shelving units to house her collection in the new apartment. \u201cMother, I collected those for years. They were very important to me.\u201d\nShe became very calm as the onslaught began.\n\u201cYou fucking little freak. Horses? Horses! That\u2019s what you care about? You called about those stupid plastic horses? What about me? Did you want to talk to your mother? Did you want to ask me how I\u2019m doing? It\u2019s been three years! Three God-damn years and the first thing you say is \u2018I\u2019d like to take my fucking horses.\u2019 You ungrateful piece of shit. Stick your fucking horses up your ass and don\u2019t call again. You got my fucking drugs or what? \u201d\nThe receiver clicked and she spoke calmly to the tone, \u201cNot if you talk to me like that.\u201d\nHer mother used a cocktail of yellow and pink and white pills and washed them down with Vodka or gin. She liked her pills colorful and alcohol clear.\nShe was terribly kind and sweet to the neighbors, bringing casseroles and lasagna over when babies were born, baking cakes with homemade buttercream frosting for school cake walks, she played well with others, but never with Megan.\nShe never counted her pills.\nMegan stashed a few every week and amassed a rainbow of drugs. She never knew which were which and chose based on color alone. She was very lucky. Smart enough not to mix colors, she took only one at a time. She was careful and organized; Megan was clean.\n\u201cWhat did you know about Penny?\u201d\n\u201cWho the fuck is Penny?\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you call her?\u201d\n\u201cPammy. My dealer\u2019s name was Pammy.\u201d\n\u201cShort? Red? Smiley?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d describe her as bouncy, but yes, that\u2019s Pammy.\u201d\n\u201cDamn. What a waste. Where do we get our drugs now?\u201d\nTheir concern lasted mere seconds as they discussed her death. They would have to find a new source. This suicide was very distressing and would ruin their weekend plans.\n\u201cDid you hear she was in there for three days?\u201d\n\u201cThe neighbor noticed the smell. They thought it was a dead rat, opened the door and, you know, dead lady.\u201d\n\u201cGross. How\u2019d she do it?\u201d\n\u201cThere were yellow and pink and white pills all over the bed.\u201d\n\u201cWhat \u2026 Flexural, Diazapam, Vicodin? Quite a mix. I thought she didn\u2019t do drugs.\u201d\n\u201cDude, we didn\u2019t even know her name. I bet she did a lot of things no one knew about.\u201d\nThe doorbell rang unexpectantly. No one knew where Megan lived: not workmates, not clients, not fuck buddies, no one.\nShe crept beneath the view of the convex peek hole in case whoever was out there was watching.\nCrawling up to the closed white wooden shutters with yellow-silk roman shades pulled half way up, she peaked between the slats to see the tapping toe of a familiar red Anne Klein pump. Her mother rang the doorbell repeatedly and began to bang on the door.\n\u201cI found you, you little whore.\u201d\nHer singsong voice wouldn\u2019t upset the neighbors. She banged again with a hollow pink object. The empty shelving units shuddered with the incessant pounding.\n\u201cI know you\u2019re in there. I saw something move in the peep hole and you\u2019re larger than and allergic to cats. Fucking let me in before I start to scream.\u201d She continued on with light and happy tone.\nMegan knew she was smiling without expression. She\u2019d been using Botox for years now, smoothing her forehead to match her marble heart.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got some things you might want in exchange for some stuff I need.\u201d\nMegan saw the nondescript paper bags lining the porch beneath flower boxes filled with yellow and pink and white pansies and snapdragons and baby roses.\nHer mother continued to pound the door with the disembodied head of a vintage My Little Pony. The fuschia-plastic mane fluttered and peeked between the fingers of her French manicure as she rapped on the door. \u201cI know you want them.\u201d\nMegan breathed deeply with back pressed against the bottom of the window sill. She would not cry; she was an adult now. They would make a business agreement. Megan didn\u2019t do business from the house, but she would make an exception for those bags of horses.\nShe would do it to reclaim her childhood.\nShe would make a deal for Sunshine and Sandy and Silver Moon and Take No Prisoners. She would open the door to kiss Gilbert and Secret Boyfriend and Takes the Cake. She would get her horses; they were worth the painful interaction to come.\n\u201cLet me in, little whore.\u201d She sang menacingly.\nMegan stayed in her hiding place but reached a bare foot to unlock the latch and throw the toggle down on the door. She remained huddled, arms around knees, as the red shoes stepped confidently onto her Italian rolled marble entry.\n\u201cWhat a dump!\u201d\n\u201cMother, wonderful to see you. What do you need?\u201d\nHer head remained buried tightly in knees, but Megan\u2019s voice sang confidence.\n\u201cYellow mostly.\u201d\n\u201cYou know I don\u2019t do business from here. How did you find me?\u201d\n\u201cYou send in the mail. I have Internet. You have phone. I\u2019m a smart woman, child. I have your precious horses.\u201d\n\u201cHow many do you want?\u201d\n\u201cAs many as you got. Mama\u2019s out.\u201d\n\u201cBathroom. Medicine cabinet. Third bottle. Third shelf. Take it. Leave the horses. Leave.\u201d\nMegan\u2019s head remained glued to her knees. She needed to shave; the bristles of hair tickled her nose.\nHer mother rifled through cabinets knocking down plastic bottles that bounced and rattled on the imported marble. \u201cWow, I\u2019m taking some pink too. You\u2019ve got great stock, but this place looks like poop, Meggy Poo-Poo. What kind of towels are these? Not nearly fluffy enough. Try Polo next time. Fifty bucks a piece at Macy\u2019s. You never could shop worth a shit.\u201d\nShe kicked the brown paper bags into the center of the living room and slammed the front door closed.\nMegan refused to move for thirty-three minutes, frozen in fear and plagued by past.\nFinally, she stretched legs across Berber carpet, raising her head and creaking neck to creep toward her beloved horses.\nOn hands and knees, she crawled across the floor to the spilled bags cradling her childhood friends.\nThey weren\u2019t talking.\nMegan began to sob.\nHorse manes mutilated, plastic flesh scorched and melted, the smell of death and sight of crinkled destruction, My Little Ponies and plastic horses without heads and broken legs littered the living room. Megan sat centered in the pile of past and reached for a scrawled note inside the third bag.\n\u201cNow you understand the buttons \u2014 Mommy.\u201d\nShe collapsed upon the carcasses of her dreams. Her business would suffer the loss.\nMegan showered and exfoliated with Bed Bath & Beyond\u2019s excellent Lavender Oatmeal scrub, picked out her favorite yellow sweater set with pearl buttons, clasped her Tiffany pearl necklace around her neck, and tilted her favorite yellow hat jauntily upon her head.\nShe lined her eyes and powdered her nose with MAC cosmetics and buried her toes into her favorite white Anne Klein sandals.\nHeading to the track with three thousand dollars spread her lips to a grimacing smile. She took three shots of Oban Scotch, filled her flask with the remainder of the bottle and placed it gently in her pink and yellow Coach purse.\nShe would not win.\nAfter the three thousand disappeared on \u201cMommy\u2019s Best Girl\u201d (the third horse in the third race), Megan sold her Coach bag to a woman in the bathroom for three hundred dollars.\nWorth significantly more, the woman readily handed over the cash.\nAfter the three hundred disappeared on \u201cMexican Night\u201d (wearing yellow and pink satins in the seventh), Megan ran around barefoot.\nHer size seven sandals went for thirty-three dollars to a woman in the stands.\nAfter the thirty-three disappeared on \u201cPenny Lane\u201d (the third horse in the eighth race), she slammed the rest of her flask and made out with a janitor behind the bar for three dollars.\nMegan missed the last race of the night. She didn\u2019t place bets as she passed out with sweater back to garbage can as white slips of lost bets littered her shoeless feet and fluttered into her lap. Dead butterflies of hope covered her body.\nSomeone stole her hat.\n\u201cMegan? Is that you?\u201d\nA gentle hand shook her shoulder.\nMegan threw up on Paul. He sat behind her at the office. Mortified, she tried to stand, but crumpled into his puke ridden arms. He lifted her off the ground and carried her to her car.\n\u201cLet me take you home.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m drive. I can fine.\u201d She slurred and jumbled words, eyes tracking dangerously, missing the keyhole and running long scratches down her yellow BMW.\n\u201cI\u2019ll follow you home.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no. I\u2019m private. I don\u2019t want to tell you where I live. I deal drugs from my house. Shhhhhh, it\u2019s a secret.\u201d\n\u201cRight. You\u2019re drunk. Sleep it off, love. I\u2019ll see you Monday at the office; I\u2019m taking a long weekend. Maybe you should too?\u201d\nMegan came to as the cop rapped on the window.\n\u201cYou gotta go. Gates closing.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir. I\u2019m sorry sir.\u201d\nDarkness bathed the empty parking lot; Megan started home sans winnings, hat, shoes, purse and dignity.\nIt was over. Paul saw her; he knew.\nHer past had found her. She told him about the drugs. She blew her safety wad at the track. Her mother stole her pre-paid stash. They would be coming demanding their drugs, and she would have to explain her life.\nShe refused to explain anything to anyone. She could no longer hold on to the lies; it was time to die.\n\u201cHey Jim. Let\u2019s you and me have a good fuck.\u201d\nMegan swallowed him with thre bottles of pills while crafting the clearly printed note.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always loved you,\u201d Jim whispered as he slid down her throat.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been a good friend,\u201d the Beam bottle cried from the recycling bin.\n\u201cThe sun will always shine on your face,\u201d the snapdragons sang in high pitched chorus from their arrangement on the table.\n\u201cWe looovvveee youuuuu!\u201d the horse ghosts screamed from their twisted mass grave.\nMegan fell asleep staring at her only family photograph; her father held her tight in his arms of safety.\nTo Whom It May Concern:\nI just didn\u2019t want to go to work today.\n\u2014Me\nPam Benjamin is a writer living in San Francisco.

Her mind is cloudy; she was supposed to be studying for an exam but instead got lost in memories. She cringes to think how her boyfriend might act if she tries to confide in him later. He insists that she should \u201cjust move on\u201d and \u201cstop living in the past.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not that easy! She tries to shake off her thoughts and focus on the clouds meandering across the sky. She spies a hastily drawn sign, Sharpie on cardboard, declaring:\nGARAGE SALE \u2014 SHOULDERS\nFRI + SAT, 9am-3pm.\n41 MAYFIELD STREET.\nCASH ONLY.\nShe turns, instantly, reaching for her purse to confirm she has cash on her. She does.\nMonica loves garage sales. They pop up in her neighborhood all summer long. Number 41 is about halfway down the street. She walks up the driveway, the only gravel one on the block, and stares up at the baby blue house with yellow shutters. It looks almost crooked.\nMonica doesn\u2019t see any other shoppers, but that doesn\u2019t bother her. She can peruse in peace. She isn\u2019t sure where the homeowner is, either. But her eyes light up at the sight she beholds. Shoulders and shoulders and shoulders \u2014 dozens of them!\nAll around her the shoulders stretch and roll, waves of movement all the way down the driveway. There are skinny shoulders and muscular shoulders, dainty shoulders and fatty shoulders, tattooed shoulders and unadorned shoulders, scarred shoulders and pristine shoulders. She walks up to the closest pair on her left, a lean, wiry, copper-colored set. She runs a finger across them and they shiver.\nWhat luck to stumble upon a garage sale of shoulders! Monica wants to run through and touch them all, but restrains herself. She makes her way slowly, not sure what she is looking for exactly. Something different. At five foot three, Monica\u2019s build is remarkably average. Her shoulders have hardened from years of carrying a heavy load. They are accustomed to shrinking at the slightest sign of confrontation. Why not trade her shoulders in? The opportunity is too good to pass up.\nA pair on her right call to her \u2014feminine, soft, the color of moonlight. She strokes them gently with her index finger. They\u2019re soft as a tulip petal, but they recoil at her touch. Too shy. Not those.\nShe wants fierce shoulders. Strong ones that can carry anything, push through, hold up under pressure. She meanders through rows of shifting shoulders; they are restless.\nOne pair in the back catches her eye.\nMonica races toward them. They have everything: they are defined and muscular, hefty, with their own weight. They look powerful. They would never hold fear or anxiety. She reaches toward them to investigate and they unfurl like a bird showing off its wingspan.\nThey are unafraid to take up space. They are perfect.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take them!\u201d she announces. The shoulders straighten with pride and she is confident it is a good match. No one arrives to confirm it.\nMonica wanders into the garage and spies a card table with a bell and cash box on top. She dings the bell twice.\n\u201cHello?\u201d an old woman shuffles through the side door with curlers in her hair, face crinkled in confusion. \u201cOh, I forgot we were having a garage sale today. Jesus. Why did George set it up for today?\u201d\nShe frowns and sits on a tattered lawn chair.\n\u201cHow much for these shoulders?\u201d Monica asks, dragging the perfect pair over, arm wrapped around them in a side hug.\n\u201cI dunno, $50?\u201d the old woman says with a yawn.\nMonica\u2019s face crumples. \u201cThat\u2019s more than I have.\u201d She digs in her purse. \u201cI\u2019ve got $43,\u201d she continues rifling through the bag, coins clinking. \u201cAnd 74 cents.\u201d\n\u201cSold,\u201d the woman says, opening the cash box and letting Monica plunk in her coins and bills.\nMonica shrieks joyfully, dancing around in circles on the garage floor, kicking up clouds of dirt. \u201cWould you \u2026 help me install them?\u201d she asks, once she stops spinning.\nThe old woman pushes herself up with a groan. \u201cSure, happy to do the honors. Your key?\u201d\nMore rustling as Monica digs in her purse.\n\u201cHere you go!\u201d she drops a small, golden key into the woman\u2019s open palm.\nThe woman reaches behind Monica\u2019s ear and inserts the key at the round spot just below the earlobe. It turns and clicks. There\u2019s a creak and a sigh as her shoulders disengage. The woman pulls them out carefully and sets them on a stump off to the side. She picks up the bulky shoulders and tries to slot them into position.\nGrunting, she tells Monica, \u201cI don\u2019t know about this.\u201d She heaves again, turns backwards and uses her body weight to push. Finally, they click into place.\n\u201cThank you so much!\u201d Monica coos, bouncing up and down. \u201cWhoa!\u201d she wobbles, suddenly off balance from the heaviness of her new shoulders. She rolls them around, pops them out of their sockets and back in. She sighs with satisfaction. \u201cWhat should we do about these?\u201d she asks, gesturing to her discarded shoulders.\nThey slouch dejectedly on the stump.\n\u201cOh, just leave them. I\u2019ll dispose of them for ya,\u201d the old woman offers.\n\u201cGreat! Thanks again!\u201d Monica marches out without a spare thought for the shoulders that carried her head around for the past 26 years. This is for the best.\nShe is not used to the new set and bangs her right shoulder on a chain link fence as she turns the corner. She picked these shoulders for a reason, though, and knew they would serve her well. Monica would adapt. She always did.\n* * *\nAt home that evening, Monica struts around the kitchen preparing dinner, settling into her new shoulders. She rolls them, turns on the music and shimmies with them. She closes the refrigerator and slams cupboards shut with them. They are powerful, as she suspected. She made a good investment.\nShe is making tacos for dinner, Charlie\u2019s favorite. She pushes the ground beef around in the pan and sprinkles in more Ortega seasoning. It smells good. The front door eases open.\n\u201cHey sweetie!\u201d she calls.\n\u201cHey babe,\u201d he replies, heading into the kitchen and giving her a quick kiss on the cheek. He is about to head to the fridge for a beer but stops abruptly, noticing her new, meaty shoulders.\n\u201cBabe?\u201d he asks, running his hands up and down her shoulder blades. \u201cWhat are these?\u201d They feel jacked under his hands, rippling with muscle.\n\u201cI got some new shoulders at a garage sale today!\u201d she says, smiling brightly. \u201cI\u2019m making tacos for you,\u201d she adds as she spoons hot beef into his mouth. He sputters.\n\u201cBabe! I want to talk about your shoulders, don\u2019t change the subject.\u201d\n\u201cCharlie, you know I hate it when you call me babe. How many times have I asked you not to?\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about that! Why did you buy man shoulders?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not man shoulders, they\u2019re just shoulders!\u201d\n\u201cYou look like a dude.\u201d\n\u201cI do not!\u201d\n\u201cI would know. I\u2019m a dude.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like you look at your own shoulders all the time and have perfectly memorized the anatomy of a dude-shoulder,\u201d she fires back.\n\u201cNo, but I have to stare at yours all the time. How am I supposed to go out in public with you when you have beefcake shoulders?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s my body and my decision!\u201d she huffs, frantically stirring the beef in the frying pan. It is starting to burn.\n\u201cYou could have at least asked me first!\u201d he retorts, face reddening.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need your permission!\u201d she says. Teeth gritted. The windows are open in their tiny apartment, the first floor of an old house. She does not want the neighbors to hear another fight. She abandons the stove and scurries around closing windows. Frazzled, she returns to the kitchen.\n\u201cWhen you got a new chest last winter, I supported you 100%.\u201d She is trying to keep her cool. She only wanted these new, muscly shoulders so she could carry all the heaviness better. Charlie wouldn\u2019t understand.\n\u201cI got a new chest for you!\u201d he bellows. \u201cYou think I want to fuck you with those man-shoulders?\u201d\nHer jaw clenches. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we talk about this later and just enjoy our tacos?\u201d\nShe thinks she\u2019s being very generous, letting that comment slide.\n\u201cI\u2019m allowed to want my girl to be feminine! I don\u2019t want to look like a pussy because you\u2019re stronger than me.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re even more insecure than I thought,\u201d she mutters.\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re a bitch. An ugly, mannish bitch.\u201d He shoves her hard into the refrigerator. The handle jams into her shoulder blades and she can feel a bruise start to blossom. \u201cI want you to regret getting those hideous shoulders. Babe.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m keeping the shoulders, Charlie.\u201d\n\u201cLike hell you are.\u201d He picks up the full frying pan and advances toward her. \u201cWon\u2019t look so good with burn scars, will they?\u201d He swings the frying pan blindly, meat flying everywhere.\nMonica ducks and rolls to, her shoulders catching her when she hits the linoleum.\nCharlie\u2019s eyes are red. Lightly seasoned beef drips down the yellow walls, leaving a trail of grease in its wake. Monica was just trying to be strong. Was strength too much to want for herself?\nShe pushes herself up from the floor and prowls toward Charlie, fury coursing through her body.\nShe grunts like an animal. She pins him against the wall with her new shoulders, watching his eyes widen in fear. That fear she feels all the time, it is all over his face now, and it feels good.\nShe shifts her shoulder, puts some muscle behind it, and sends him through the window with a crash.\nShattered glass sparkles onto the porch floorboards like hail, followed by the dull thud of his lanky body.\nMonica turns up the volume on the music, dusts off her beloved new shoulders, and bends down to sweep up the greasy beef before it stains the floor.\nTonight, she will crawl into their queen bed and enjoy the extra room, sprawling her legs wide.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

It was Christmas, her first with a man that she wanted her family to meet.\nShe\u2019d come straight home from college. She\u2019d taken the bus after her last class straight back to the home she grew up in. The first thing her mother made her do was change from her comfortable blue jeans to a black skirt, and then complained that it was too short.\n1967 meant nothing to the old fashioned women in the room; knees were not meant to be seen in their kitchen.\nHe was running late because there was traffic. No worries. She knew that was going to happen, so she told her mother that he was coming an hour later than he said.\nThere was a jolt in the kitchen: someone said something funny. She didn\u2019t go into the kitchen and find out what, because it was boiling in there. But a chorus of laughs swept over her \u2014 old laughs that end in coughs, laughs trying to hide because that\u2019s what they\u2019re used to, wheezing laughs, breathy laughs, clapping laughs, stomping laughs, crying laughs, out-of-breath laughs, giggling laughs, whiny types of laughs, the I-was-drinking-something laugh, pregnant woman laughs, the new mother laugh, the I-don\u2019t-feel-like-laughing laugh, the classic \u201cholding onto your sister while she tries not to get her hair in Grandma\u2019s pasta because she\u2019s bent over laughing\u201d laugh \u2026\nShe marveled at how warm it is to be a black woman.\nSo she sat under a blanket on the couch with her sleepy little brother. Her uncle confiscated toys and books and other gadgets from kids, so they could actually do something with the snow outside. His grumbling under a graying mustache was a dull roar in her ear.\nIt was funny; she always thought your heart was supposed to beat out of your chest during moments like this. But as she listened to it, it was like a man beating a gong inside of her ribs and every second she thought about him and what her father would say was a vibration.\nIt wasn\u2019t the cold making her shiver.\nIf she could cancel out one part of her mind, would it be her thoughts or her emotions? If she could cancel out one of her senses, which one would it be?\nForget the basic five, those belonged to her body. And love was blind, deaf, and dumb \u2014 so which one of her senses would she cancel from her heart?\nShe closed her eyes. She didn\u2019t want to see. She only wanted to listen.\nChildren in the snow, shrieking as Mother Nature played along with them. She heard each snowball like a gunshot and she hoped she was the next in line to be caught in the crossfire between human and nature.\nShe heard the women, now singing, and fell into the voice of her mother, her aunt, her sister and the women just like them. It was their life and their story. The song begged to be heard as it beat from their hearts; it knew where it was going. Their hearts knew where they wanted to be and they were loud and proud and she wondered why she was afraid.\nIf she loved this man, why was she so ashamed to say it, to sing it, to praise it, to pray for him, to make it real with words \u2014 real, honest to God, truthful words, the only sound that ever made anything real.\nShe wanted to say it so much that it lost its meaning, just so she could spend years trying to find it again.\nThe occasional shadowy and yet tangible \u201cI love you,\u201d said factually as a stepping stool for confidence, was a promise not to run away \u2014 from the scrutinizing gaze from her father that still made her fold into herself; from the veiled and vague judgments from her mother that still made her cry some nights (only the nights where she was alone).\nDisappointment and disapproval were the universal defenses of all parents who felt as if they were losing their children.\nShe remembered meeting him. She was passing the bus stop, on her way to lunch after class, when she\u2019d dropped her book in front of a group of white men.\nShe didn\u2019t feel like getting heckled or worse today, not after what had been happening that week on campus. She wanted to keep her head down and not think about it.\nHe was the tallest one behind the man with her book between his feet. She didn\u2019t glance at him once because she was busy self-loathing. Legs wobbling as she reached for it, she saw a pair of shoes move out of the way, and a different pair came from her peripheral vision.\nBut she kept her eyes focused on her book and her mind on how dumb she was and as her fingers closed around the cover, his fingers brushed over hers.\nHe had pushed past his friend to get her book for her and the shock made her drop it again.\nShe apologized and stood up quickly, smoothing out and pulling down her skirt. She looked up at him for the first time, andasked him for her book in the smallest voice possible.\nAnd he was smiling at her, shyly as if this was his fault too. As he fumbled for the book he just picked up, his friends sniggered behind him. He turned red. That made him drop his papers and curse underneath his breath.\nShe remembered that as she was bending down and picking them up for him, the ghost of a smile graced her lips. He had grinned, handing her book back to her.\nShe accepted.\nThe next afternoon, and every single one after that for a week on her way to lunch, she saw him standing there alone, whether she was alone, with friends, in the rain, in the heat \u2026\nHe was buzzing with nervousness each time, she could feel it. As she passed by him, he looked at her as if he was trying not to \u2014 but she always managed to catch his eye. She wasn\u2019t sure, but this was probably what being pursued felt like and it made her feel pretty \u2014 and forget that it was dangerous.\nOne afternoon, on a whim, she sat down next to him. His lips curled up in a smile and talked to her about Hamlet, the book she dropped a long time ago. She gave him her number. They talked at every hour they could.\nA month later, at 4 a.m., he asked her to go to a drive-in, and she had said yes before she even gave herself a chance to think about it.\nIt scared her to be so ashamed of him.\nInterracial soulmates have existed since the dawn of time. Back in slave times, slave women with white soulmates were sentenced to death immediately or kept as a mistress in the house. It was illegal to marry in pretty much every state. If she tried to work around the law, some states would still sentence her to death. If you drew a hand like this, you basically had to either live without your soulmate, or hide away in secret.\nSomething about that solitude, more than death or jail, made her feel like she was not safe. Her throat tightened.\nIt could be so easy for him to be arrogant with her. The men she\u2019d dated prior were always cool and calm, never seemed to worry about messing up, because they knew she wasn\u2019t the one.\nShe liked that he was nervous picking her up for her first date. Because if they were being serious, in shades of black to white and pink to blue, he was the one with the power. Their feelings were truly in spite of fate.\nHer silence about him had taken over. Silence had been the one waking up in white arms and brewing two cups of coffee with three packets of white sugar and kissing pink frosted lips goodbye as they both headed to work.\nIt had been coming home to make dinner and watch the Ed Sullivan Show with, and sleep next to and with, a white man who treated her less like property than her own father did.\nHer silence wouldn\u2019t shut up to friends about her miracle \u2014 but it feared parents. It did not want to admit that she did the one thing she knew she wasn\u2019t supposed to do but that felt right.\nAnd when he pulled up in his broken-down, beat-up car, she knew.\nThe children went silent. The white snow fell to the ground, harmless bullets.\nIt wasn\u2019t the cold making her shiver. Mother Nature and those children had never heard a white man talk to them without segregation on his tongue, separate but equal tattooed on both of his lips, or \u201chello\u201d meaning \u201cback of the bus.\u201d\nAs he turned the doorknob, she threw the blanket off of herself and put her head in her hands. She closed her eyes. She didn\u2019t want to see. She only wanted to listen, but her silence just wouldn\u2019t shut up about her miracle. Her heart betrayed her body, because her body didn\u2019t want to be there, didn\u2019t want to hear her mother gasp, didn\u2019t want to hear her father yell.\nAll her heart wanted to do was listen.\nHer mother sang with fervor in the distance.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Many left the television on during the visit, during prayer. And the pastor was uncertain whether the television made his people more despairing and in need of prayer, or more inspired and open to communication with the divine.\nDeeply in need of inspiration himself, he began to pray at home while watching television. Yet the prayers he made seemed to him trite, banal, sentimental.\nOne night, filled with trepidation, he typed a prayer he had made into Google and discovered that it already existed, typed in by someone else who had prayed while watching television.\nHe tried others, and as he\u2019d feared, the same thing occurred. Everything had already been said.\nThis troubled and confused him. Did it mean that God was everywhere, and that there was no original way to pray because all was foreknown? Or did it mean that in praying, he was only imitating Google?\nAnd yet, those prayers he found on Google received praise and were credited with miracles. Some pastors on Instagram had tens of thousands of followers. And their prayers seemed much more successful than any prayers he had ever made with his own people.\nMournful and alone, he contemplated starting his own Instagram account.\nHe continued to pray with the television on, until one night the television screen darkened at the edges and narrowed down to a single point of light before going black.\nHe saw his own darkish reflection in the screen, and he heard an angelic voice, a voice that sounded like Julie Andrews, speaking to him.\nA tranquil heart gives life to the flesh, but envy makes the bones rot.\nAnd he replaced the television with a saltwater aquarium.\nHe still went out amongst his people, but now when he retreated to his small house, he sat in front of the aquarium and meditated on the clownfish, and the resplendent anthias, and the canary blennies, and the blue damselfish, and he felt no need to pray nor to type his prayers into Google.\nBut his peace and serenity did not last.\nThe fish began to disappear. All the tranquil colorful fish he contemplated vanished one by one, until all that was left was the cuttlefish, and a single coral beauty.\nThat last evening, he watched the blue and deep-oranged beauty flit from rock to rock in the tank. And the cuttlefish opened its eyes shaped like smeared crooked streaks, and changed the color and texture of its body to blend with the sand, and raised itself slightly on its eight legs.\nWhen the beauty neared, the cuttlefish shot out its two long feeding tentacles, grasped and paralyzed the fish with venom, and drew it back toward its beak.\nThe pastor watched as the cuttlefish ate and then settled down in the sand to sleep. He had read that cuttlefish, cephalopods, had evolved distinct from humans and other vertebrates over two hundred million years ago.\nThough the fact was doctrinally suspect, he pondered the age of the cuttlefish, how ancient its three-hearted being, how primordial its mind \u2014 distributed throughout its body so that even the tips of the legs were sentient.\nThe pastor watched for hours as the cuttlefish slept alone in the aquarium.\nThen the cuttlefish opened its strange godlike eyes, and the pastor knew that it was looking in all directions simultaneously, surveying him and the entire world. And he heard another voice, this time deep and sonorous, asking him questions.\nWhere wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Hast thou walked the floor of the ocean? Or hast thou dived in search of the depth?\nThe cuttlefish began to change the colors of its body, darkish waves moving from its head to its tail in a hypnotizing pattern, and the pastor gazed at it and became convinced that the voice he heard was coming from the cuttlefish.\nIt did not sound like Julie Andrews. It sounded like a voice from the well of the earth\u2019s beginning.\nThe voice of the cuttlefish continued to question the pastor, and he did not believe that even Google could answer.\nAt last, he removed his collar. Then he removed his dark suit, and his underwear, and naked he brought a stepladder to the side of the aquarium.\nHe climbed the ladder, and entered the water and lowered himself to the sand, and sat underwater before the cuttlefish that still sent patterns of light and dark rippling down its body.\nThe cuttlefish regarded the man before it, and also regarded the world the man had come from.\nThen it fanned its body out to swim to the surface and used its long tentacles to pull itself over the edge of the aquarium and onto the stepladder.\nIt put on the suitcoat, poked its tentacles through the arms of the coat, though it let the pants lie, as the cuttlefish had eight legs, not only two.\nThe white collar was difficult, as the cuttlefish did not have a neck, but it managed to wedge the collar between the lapels of the suitcoat and its skin.\nThe cuttlefish looked simultaneously back at the naked man in the tank and forward at the front door.\nIt shot out a tentacle, fastened onto the door with its suckers, and pulled it open.\nThe cuttlefish walked out. It had been waiting millennia upon millennia for this. Now it was time at last to set things back in order.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Right there in front of me. It opened.\nI would like to say it surprised me, but I was expecting it. So I wasn\u2019t surprised, per se. I was more awed that it actually happened. I thought the incantation, the one given to me as I prowled alleys littered with sexual desperation, wouldn\u2019t actually work. I mean, who expects to find real magic at 4 a.m. on a Tuesday?\nI did, though, and it was whispered to me by a guy whose toenails curved and whose breath smelled of Steel Reserve.\nWhen I paused in front of him, unaware that he was sleeping at my feet, he grabbed my ankle. Now, that surprised me. In my shock, I fell. My head then next to his he whispered the incantation to me, and: \u201cOnly say this if you wish to fall again.\u201d\nI forgot him and the incantation when I picked myself up and turned my back. The memory only came back as a result of the letter I got from the Employment Development Department saying I had run out of all of my allocated benefits.\nTwo years of unemployment, of too-many-to-count applications and rejections, of missed payments and collections calls, of ignored healthcare spiraling into emergency visits, of counting change for McDonald\u2019s \u201cvalue meals,\u201d of apologetic responses to friends\u2019 invitations. Two years of sinking, of falling, of spiraling downward.\nI thought there was nowhere lower to go. Then I got EDD\u2019s letter.\nI spent the afternoon pacing around my studio apartment inventorying everything of value: the thousands of CDs collected over decades, the Dolce and Gabbana suit bought as a birthday whim, the ceramic bust of Einstein, the Cuisinart given as an X-mas gift, the six-year-old computer that sometimes won\u2019t even turn on, the $50 gift card to Best Buy. Even if it all sold for a reasonable price, it still wouldn\u2019t be enough to pay rent.\n\u201cLate as usual,\u201d I thought to myself. I lay down on the couch to nap.\nAs I slept, I dreamt.\nI was again prowling the alley, swimming from too much tequila and flying from one too many joints. A man wearing only leather suspenders attached to 501s and police boots whistled. A hobbling pigeon with a broken wing and deformed feet pecked at invisible crumbs. I saw movement in the doorway of an abandoned fire station, certain it was some sexual predator, only to find out it was another decrepit pigeon.\nMany people slept in doorways and in the shadows behind the streetlights. I halted, couldn\u2019t decide where to go, wanted just to stand in shadow. It was then that I felt the hand on my ankle. I started, and fell.\nI woke before the old man could again whisper his incantation \u2014 sweating, feeling as if the bottom was falling beneath me. I walked to my closet of a bathroom, turned on the shower, and waited for the hot water to flow freely as I stared at myself in the mirror. I was crying. Again. It seems I cry almost every time I look at my reflection. How can I be 36 and still unemployed? How can I not pay my bills? How did I end up as this pitiful person who keeps sinking?\nThe reflection of memories stared back at me from the mirror. Misery just loves memories.\nThere was my boss handing me my final check with a simple, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s just business. And \u2026 business is slow right now.\u201d\nThere was the patronizing unemployment councilor shaming me for accepting benefits.\nThere was my mother: tall, hair black from youth, sobbing behind the water heater as she said, \u201cYou are why I cry.\u201d\nThere was the priest whose familiar lips whispered sins and absolutions.\nAnd with each reflection I slipped a little deeper.\nWithout bathing, I turned off the shower. I needed to leave my bathroom, to stop staring at the past. My belly grumbled. There was no food in my fridge or cupboards. The loose change had all been spent.\nHaving no glasses in the bathroom, I went to the kitchenette, grabbed a glass, filled it to overflowing. Messily, I gulped two glasses and filled a third. Still my belly grumbled. I needed another nap.\nI turned around ready to walk the ten steps from my kitchenette to my couch as the incantation, as if of its own volition, escaped my lips. Then my lips called it forth again, this time as loud as a thunder clap.\nThe hole opened right there in front of me. A perfect circle, edges smooth, no debris to be found. Just a hole. A perfectly circular hole. It made me dizzy. I fell as foretold.\n***\nI am here on the other side, and I cannot see back into my past life. It is dark here, but it is not the darkness of despair or misery. It is not the hopelessness of falling. It is the darkness of the unknown, the uncharted, the undiscovered. It is terrifying. It is the freedom of surrender.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

She maintained a retinue of thousands, assigned to all manner of tasks. Many in her employ were the most gifted and respected of their kind.\nAmong those responsible for various types of fauna alone you could count dozens, if not hundreds of specialists. The Keeper of Horses oversaw the royal stables together with the herds that roamed the plains and moorlands. The Keeper of Hounds was responsible for the hunting dogs in the kennels as well as the lap dogs at court. The Piscine Master was responsible for keeping the lakes and rivers stocked with all manner of fishes, from lampreys used in healing to sturgeon destined for the table.\nThese were but a few of the ranks of servants charged by the royal household with the care, feeding and husbandry of the many creatures who in their various ways supported the state.\nSo it came to the Empress\u2019s attention that she lacked a Master of Birds. The Keeper of Jesses trained and housed the hunting hawks. The Keeper of Coops maintained the homing pigeons that allowed the realm\u2019s cities and garrisons to share news and coordinate their movements. The Keeper of Hatcheries oversaw the many buildings and yards, marshes, and meadows where the domesticated fowl lived out their lives.\nBut no individual saw to the welfare of the birds of the field. The Empress wished to ensure that they, too, thrived through all seasons, for their practical uses as well as the simple joy they gave.\nTo find the individual best suited to this position, the Empress dispatched fast riders to fan out through her lands. In every settlement, large and small, near and far, these heralds proclaimed the Empress\u2019s intention to find a person to occupy the post of Master of Birds.\nThe Empress assigned such importance to this newly created post, the riders announced, that she would personally audition any individual who took it upon themselves to make the journey to the capital in response to the call. Audiences were to take place over a three-day period beginning on the summer solstice.\n*\nOn the morning of the solstice, a young man with a clever face presented himself at court and stated his intention to serve Her Grace as Master of Birds.\n\u201cAnd how should we judge you to be qualified?\u201d asked the Empress.\n\u201cAllow me to demonstrate,\u201d stated the young man with an easy confidence. Using a stick of charcoal he produced from his robe, he then dashed off a note in a hasty hand, as if he were a physician writing a prescription. He rolled it into a tight cylinder, slid it into a thin metal tube, and, with a bow, presented it to his sovereign.\n\u201cIf it pleases Your Grace to post a watchman just there\u201d \u2014 and here he pointed to a position on a nearby battlement \u2014 \u201cthen in two hours you shall have your answer.\u201d\nThe young man then asked, and received, an escort to the battlement, where he poised a loosely woven wicker box, propped up by a slender twig, over a scatter of flax seeds.\nAt a certain moment, witnessed by the watchman and by several others who loitered out of sheer curiosity, a linnet landed next to the box, hopped beneath it to peck at the seed, and tripped the twig in doing so.\nThe young man recovered the box, cupped the linnet gently in his hands, and resumed his audience before the Empress, who understood she was to open and unravel the message placed in the tube. \u201cA variegated linnet,\u201d the message read, \u201cat precisely five minutes past noon.\u201d\n\u201cI am most pleased and impressed,\u201d stated the Empress. \u201cBy your skill as well as your knowing touch. How did you come by such talents?\u201d\n\u201cI cannot say, Augusta. I simply understand birds. I have observed them countless hours since I was a little boy.\u201d\n\u201cI can only imagine you shall be my Master of Birds,\u201d stated the Empress with a smile. \u201cBut for the sake of form, we must allow two days\u2019 more time for any others who desire this post to step forward and present themselves.\u201d\n*\nThe morning of the second day passed without any new aspirants to the post of Master of Birds appearing at court. Word of the previous day\u2019s impressive performance circulated through the Palace District and the city itself, and if any others had arrived to compete for the position perhaps they now felt discouraged from doing so.\nAs the afternoon shadows began to lengthen, however, an innocent-faced young woman wearing the traditional dress of the people of the hinterlands took her place before the Empress and her attendants. She moved with such a shy and graceful air that more than one of those present brought a hand to their hearts.\n\u201cBy what means shall we know you are suited to be my Master of Birds?\u201d asked the Empress.\nWithout a word, the girl retired to the courtyard outside the royal audience chambers, arranged her long skirts neatly in a circle around her, and seated herself just so.\nAt the random cawing of a crow flying above the palace walls, the girl raised her left arm at the elbow and bent her pointer finger as if to suggest a perch. Immediately the crow altered its course, spiraling downward towards her. Her hands now resting neat as a napkin her lap, the girl sat with sublime composure as the crow settled on her shoulder.\nThose who witnessed this event beat their chests and raised a cheer. They cheered again, even more heartily when, to their disbelief, a second crow descended, taking up a position on the girl\u2019s other shoulder. Once settled, both creatures rubbed their heads against the young woman\u2019s plaited hair with evident affection.\nAnswering her sovereign\u2019s bid to stand and come forward, the girl did so, accompanied by the crows, content to remain perched on her shoulders.\n\u201cI had thought we found our Master of Birds already,\u201d the Empress remarked. \u201cBut I see I was mistaken. The gifts you possess, Little Sister, are truly remarkable. However did you come by them?\u201c\n\u201cI cannot say, Augusta. I simply love the birds. The love radiates from my heart and whether these beloved creatures simply feel its warmth or sense it in my voice and gestures is not mine to know. But I have lived with this agape since my earliest days.\u201d\n\u201cI believe I can say with certainty that you shall be my Master of Birds,\u201d stated the Empress with a radiant smile. \u201cBut we must honor our commitment to allow one day more for any others who desire this post to present themselves.\u201d\n*\nThe third day passed uneventfully. \u201cFor the sake of form and tradition,\u201d advised the Lady Chamberlain, \u201cyou should permit any late-coming aspirants to the post of Master of Birds to come forward up until the setting of the sun. But I think we can reasonably strike the chamber and dismiss the court some time before then.\u201d\nAnd so they did.\nTo their utter surprise, however, they heard a modest but determined rapping on the tall metal doors to the audience chamber as the redmost rays of the sun were plaiting the yards and chasing down the colonnades of the Palace District.\n\u201cAnd who presents themselves at this hour?\u201d called the ramsho sentry through the chamber doors.\n\u201cAn old woman and her grandson come to beseech the Empress\u2019s consideration for the honor of serving as Master of Birds,\u201d came the voice of an ancient dame.\n\u201cIt is past the hour the Empress would see her people,\u201d the sentry replied. \u201cThe door remains closed.\u201d\n\u201cHow can it be past the hour?\u201d the old woman asked. \u201cThe sun still warms my back.\u201d\n\u201cI believe the Empress has found her Master of Birds in any event, mother,\u201d replied the sentry.\n\u201cWe have journeyed to this daunting capital from a long ways off,\u201d the grandson, a mere boy, countered. \u201cAnd for granny three day\u2019s journey is equal to any other traveler\u2019s one. I ask not for myself, but granny here is tired and parched, having traveled so far to serve our sovereign.\u201d\nTaking pity on the two, and acknowledging the merit of their petition, however reluctantly, the sentry summoned a courier to locate the Lady Chamberlain and inquire her wishes.\nThe Chamberlain, too, reluctantly acceded to the pair\u2019s request. As long as cool water, a wash and a few hours\u2019 rest on a freshly stuffed pallet were all they required, she felt no need to disturb the Empress.\nUpon receiving his instructions and opening the doors, the sentry\u2019s eyes widened in surprise. The old woman\u2019s own eyes were two featureless moonstones. As the grandson guided her, the guard saw that the young boy, too, possessed the same opaque lamps as his grandmother. Yet the rapid motions of his head, abruptly torquing this way and that, gave the impression that he was taking note of his surroundings in minute detail.\nThe sentry caught himself starting to count the individual flecks of mica in the matrix of the polished floor. None of the thousands of individuals who had crossed this threshold, people of every station and condition, had ever displayed a tic such as this lad\u2019s, he considered.\nAnd the spring in his step, effortless as an acrobat\u2019s: Yes, the sentry could see, the boy placed his weight forward, on the balls of his feet and the spread of his toes, leaving the heels slightly raised. Without thinking, the man shifted his own weight slightly. The boy smiled.\nGranny, too, moved in an uncanny way. Though she lent her hand to the boy, he did nothing more than touch his fingertips to hers. Nor did she match his progress step for step. Instead, she held back for a beat or two, cocking her head as if to consider sounds too faint for the sentry to register. Satisfied, she would rejoin the boy with a quick hop. Did the cane she held even tap the floor? Yes, but faintly, the sentry confirmed, as if simply to acknowledge that the floor was there.\nSurprising as he found the blind pair, the next occurrence left the sentry at a loss to explain. As the two travelers stepped inside, it seemed that birds in every tree took to the air for a few short wingbeats and increased the volume of their ramsho praise.\nThe sentry summoned a courier once more, who nodded as he took stock of the scene for himself. The courier did his job well, delivering the message with all its uncanny quality. While a last bit of light still remained in the sky, the Empress and her attendants reassembled.\n\u201cAugusta is beyond considerate to this poor soul, so far strayed past the bounds of her deserving,\u201d the old woman said.\n\u201cMother\u2019s courtesy truly moves this humble ruler,\u201d replied the Empress. \u201cWe bid you rest and respite from your travels.\u201d\nBut the old woman had other ideas besides rest, it seemed. She politely but firmly requested a chance to prove herself the most deserving claimant to the post of Master of Birds.\nWhy should I not extend her this courtesy? the Empress decided, if only to humor the poor thing.\nAfter a deep bow, the old woman leaned against her cane and began to speak. She spoke of intimate moments glimpsed through an open window on Goldsmith Lane. She spoke of three children fishing for bream on the banks of the tributary. She spoke of a man making a cat dance in pursuit of the feather he dangled. She spoke of the traffic approaching the city on the Eastern Road in the final minutes before the doors at its terminus withdrew for the night. She spoke of two Ladies in Waiting touching the silken bedclothes laid out for the Empress in her bedchamber. She spoke of these and many other things.\nThe Empress kept silent for many heartbeats before speaking. \u201cI have never seen my city in such poignant detail,\u201d she concluded, sinking back into the cushions on her throne. \u201cWas I for a short span the Eye of God?\u201d\n\u201cYou were the eyes of the birds, Augusta,\u201d said the Master of Birds in her cracked hurdy-gurdy of a voice. \u201cIt is one thing to understand the birds. Another thing, to love them. And yet another, to be them.\u201d","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Nobody wants stories about pirates.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cToo much scurvy.\u201d\nYou laugh, and there\u2019s a brief moment where she frowns like she wasn\u2019t kidding, before she laughs too, to stave off the awkwardness. In the silence afterward, she asks, \u201cwould you read a book about pirates?\u201d\n\u201cProbably not,\u201d you say. \u201cI like medieval stories. About kings and queens and knights and castles.\u201d\n\u201cAnd dragons?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d you say, and feel foolish. \u201cWhen I read, I \u2026 pretend that I\u2019m there. Dragons are a bit much for me.\u201d\nIt\u2019s more than that. When you read a good book, you can hear the characters talk, see the worlds they live in, feel the emotions in the air. It\u2019s a strange sort of magic. In this cool air, with the shadows long at your feet and the leaves turning golden against the sky before gently drifting to the ground, it\u2019s easier to confess. It\u2019s easier to confess to this girl, who works in this quaint little bookshop and surely understands what it\u2019s like to be a reader.\nShe studies you, and then nods. Like you\u2019ve passed a test.\n\u201cWe\u2019re closed now,\u201d she says, though the sign behind the door says open. \u201cBut you should return.\u201d\nDon\u2019t return to the bookshop.\nIt\u2019s pleasant enough when you return, just a shop crushed between the florist and the hardware store. There\u2019s a small cat in the window, soaking up the autumn sunlight, next to posters advertising slam poetry and missing kids. Three, now. Golden motes of dust gasp up into the air when you open the door, and instead of sneezing, you just have to admire the way that the lighting makes these tired old books glitter and come to life.\nWhen you close the door, a bell tied to the top jingles.\nThe girl is at the counter this time. She has a name-tag, but written on it is the sort of name that you forget when you stop reading it. She looks like she\u2019s bored, or possibly dead, bent over a book. Her long black hair spills over her shoulders and onto the table. There are rumors at school that she\u2019s a witch. There are rumors that she\u2019s something worse.\nIt\u2019s easy to believe in this quiet bookshop with the dust and the cat and the promise of so many worlds within the books.\n\u201cI have a question,\u201d you say.\nShe doesn\u2019t look up. \u201cSecond aisle to your left, third shelf. The maroon cover. Not red \u2014 maroon.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d you say, and if there\u2019s a smile behind that curtain of hair, you can\u2019t see it.\nYou don\u2019t think about the fact that you didn\u2019t ask a question. You don\u2019t quite remember what the question was going to be anyways, but it didn\u2019t have anything to do with a maroon book.\nBut you find the aisle, and the shelf, and the red book, and next to it, the maroon. Frail gold lettering traces the spine. The Art of Medieval Warfare.\nYour eyebrows lift. You can\u2019t remember your question, but this was not the answer.\nYou pick up the book anyways, touch the brittle pages, trace a finger down the golden letters. Finally, you take a deep breath and crack it open. It\u2019s illustrated, and beautiful, all about catapults and castle fortifications. You wonder what it would be like to live in the book. The fights inside of it seem far more concrete than the fights of this world.\nThere\u2019s a bookmark that looks newer than the book. There\u2019s words on the bookmark. Don\u2019t read those words.\nMidnight tonight. Back of the shop. There\u2019s a key under the florist\u2019s mat.\n-Lindy\nDon\u2019t keep the bookmark.\nYou pocket the bookmark and step out into the sunny afternoon.\nDon\u2019t go home.\nYour mother hurls a plate at you when you walk up the porch, that buckled-down porch with the broken banister and the third step that creaks when you put your weight onto it. It groans when you duck, and the plate sails harmlessly over your head and shatters in the grass.\nThe Art of Medieval Warfare doesn\u2019t recommend using plates as weapons. Probably.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare go to your room.\u201d Her face is red; the house smells like beer, even from outside. \u201cWe need to talk about your grades.\u201d\nYou look at her, and then at the staircase. You don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be able to make it to the top, so you climb up and leave her shouting at the bottom step. Dad will be home soon, and he can make her stop.\nDon\u2019t think too much about the bookmark.\nIt\u2019s a thin strip of laminated plastic with a blue tassel on one edge to match the beach scene printed on either side. The bookshop sells them at the front counter, but you\u2019ve never seen anybody buy one. You\u2019ve never seen anybody buy anything from there, actually. It\u2019s a wonder it stays in business, but it\u2019s possible that the rent isn\u2019t very expensive. Nothing in this town is.\nYou trace the handwriting. Lindy. Now that you\u2019ve brought her name home with you, it\u2019s easy to remember. She looks like a Lindy.\nYou put the bookmark on the windowsill, next to a dead fly, a plastic snow-globe, and two cups half filled with water that belong downstairs. It\u2019s six hours until midnight, and a thirty minute walk to the bookshop. You have time to decide.\nAnd then shouting erupts from downstairs. It\u2019s possible your decision has been made a long time ago.\nDon\u2019t go to the bookshop at night.\nIt has turned into a different creature in the dark, all shadows and shifting shades of black. You\u2019re completely alone on the street, and the bookshop doesn\u2019t feel like a promise anymore. It feels a bit like a cold autumn night, and it feels a bit like reading the paper in the morning and seeing that another girl has gone missing and thinking, that will never be me.\nA streetlamp washes soft light over a faded red car. There is a parking ticket on the windshield that has been there for a week. The circle of yellow light extends beyond the car, but stops well before the shop. The sign over the door says Welcome. The window is black and uninviting. Everything on the street is so, so still, except for a cat that trots across the sidewalk, far more purposeful than you. It\u2019s probably not the same cat from the shop.\nThere\u2019s a key underneath the florist\u2019s mat. You don\u2019t think this qualifies as breaking and entering. Unless Lindy has set you up. You don\u2019t think she has. And the key fits perfectly into the keyhole of the door that says Welcome above it.\nWhen you open that door, warm air bursts out at you, and it smells a little bit like home. Not like beer, but like old paper and dust and damp earth. So it doesn\u2019t really smell like home, but it smells like what you want home to smell like.\nThe girl is at the counter, reading beneath a lamp. The lamp is more for decoration than for light. It\u2019s stained glass, with a little brass cord hanging from it. Green and red swirls of light stamp the desk and spill onto the floor. When Lindy looks up, she puts the book down.\n\u201cFollow me to the backroom,\u201d she says.\nDo not follow her to the backroom.\nThe backroom is typical for a bookshop, or at least you think it is. You\u2019ve never been in the backroom of a bookshop before. There\u2019s a box filled with books with dented covers and missing pages, labeled defective. There\u2019s another box filled with books with question marks, labeled detective. There\u2019s a third box filled with self-help books labeled reflective, and a last box that has two books in it that might be going on clearance next week.\nThey don\u2019t matter, because there\u2019s also a table in the middle of the room with The Art of Medieval Warfare on it.\nLindy picks up the book and holds it close to her chest, like a secret. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if you would come. It\u2019s hard to tell sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d You take a deep breath. It tastes like dust. Everything in this town tastes like dust. All along, you\u2019ve felt that this town was made for leaving. \u201cWhat\u2019s it like?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier than you think. Faster, too. It\u2019s like stepping into a dream, where you feel completely at home until you wake up and realize that you didn\u2019t know anybody there.\u201d She tips her head so that her eyes shimmer with sympathy. \u201cExcept you never realize.\u201d\nLike stepping into a dream. The town has been uneasy about the disappearance of the others. Who will be next?\nBut you know that they were the lucky ones \u2014 they escaped this place.\n\u201cHave you ever?\u201d\n\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m not right now?\u201d\nLindy offers you the book. You think about your mother, and how she had seen in the paper that another girl had gone missing, and said to you: That would never be me.\nAnd she was right, like she always is, and you were wrong, like you always are.\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d\nLindy says, \u201cTouch the book.\u201d\nDo not touch that book.\nYou press your hand against The Art of Medieval Warfare. It feels warm. Like a person instead of a book. Somewhere, you hear the clank of metal against metal, distant enough that you think it could be your imagination. Lindy\u2019s smile is the only thing the light touches. \u201cAnd now you go.\u201d\nThis is the part where I tell you no. Where I whisper, do not go into that book. Where I say, your problems are not a place you can escape from.\nWhy bother? You haven\u2019t listened to anything else I\u2019ve said. None of the others did.\nYou hesitate, but only for a moment.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

There, they raised chickens and gardened. Her father was brawny, her mother strong, and though there was magic in the village, the village was far away.\nTheir next-door neighbor was a fairy, kind and cruel as fairies are. She occasionally stopped by for conversation and gossip. And so, one day during Tiger\u2019s seventh year, the fairy and the family sat in front of the woodstove, sipping bone broth, one of her mother\u2019s specialties.\nThe village was a city now, the fairy told them, with glittering towers and bridges. The people were beautiful, and they all lived forever. Yes, trolls had crawled out from under their bridges, and roving bands of goblins wreaked occasional havoc, but nobody had to work anymore, and all the animals talked.\nAnd now, the fairy said, magic was creeping out of the city and across the countryside.\nTiger\u2019s father looked troubled. \u201cWe moved here to get out of the fray. We don\u2019t want magic.\u201d\n\u201cThen I will declare it,\u201d the fairy said. \u201cYou three are destined to live an ordinary life. Boom!\u201d\nThe family heard rustles and the crackling of branches all around their little cabin, and the fairy disappeared.\n\u201cShe\u2019s cursed us!\u201d Tiger cried.\n\u201cNo, Tiger, this is our Happily Ever After!\u201d her father said, and danced her around the room.\nThe next morning, when they went out to feed the chickens, they found their entire land \u2014 forest, hill, and gardens \u2014 encircled by an impenetrable thorny hedge.\nSo Tiger grew up, in this ordinary place, while outside magic continued to surge across the land.\nIt was a good, ordinary life. Their garden grew. Their forest hosted owls and squirrels. They fed the chickens, and in exchange, the chickens fed them and fertilized the fields. In winter the sky filled with murmurations of swallows. Nothing was magical except for one creek that flowed slightly uphill, but that might have been a magnetic or gravitational thing.\nBut something terrible was slowly happening to Tiger\u2019s parents. Year by year they were fading. Their dark hair leached to gray and then to white. Their skin withered like raisins, like rich purple plums turning to prunes. Her mother\u2019s hands became crablike and her knees hurt walking up from the garden. Every evening, her father dozed on the couch in front of the woodstove, which Tiger stoked with wood from their forest, and barely dragged himself to bed.\nThere are many kinds of exhaustion: The exhaustion of quicksand that fights your attempts to get free. The weariness of thick summer air. The fatigue of fear. This was different: a deepening torpor, a lassitude. It was slow and pervasive. Tiger feared that her parents would wither and blow away.\n\u201cI read that in the city they have an elixir,\u201d she told her parents. \u201cIt can return you to your vibrant selves.\u201d\n\u201cNothing can be done,\u201d her mother said. \u201cBesides, the hedge is impenetrable. And, a magic elixir probably won\u2019t work here; I don\u2019t see how it could.\u201d\nTiger turned eighteen. She was a woman, and it was time to break through the hedge and travel to the city. It was her Once Upon a Time; she would quest for the elixir to save her parents.\n\u201cOh my darling, I know you must go,\u201d her mother said. \u201cIt\u2019s the way of the world. Remember these things, they are all I have to give you.\u201d She ticked them off on gnarled fingers: \u201cUse your wits. Beauty is only skin deep. There\u2019s healing in bone broth; I\u2019ll pack you some. You\u2019ll need an ally. Oh, and you\u2019ll probably encounter three strangers.\u201d\nShe poured Tiger a jug of broth, boiled a dozen eggs from their hens, and packed it all in a wicker basket. Tiger\u2019s father muttered good-luck wishes from his drowse. Tiger loaded the woodbin one more time, and left him snoring on the couch.\nIt wasn\u2019t easy, but Tiger breached the hedge bit by bit, breaking the thorny branches by hand. Finally, though scratched and poked, she\u2019d made a big enough hole. She pushed her basket through, then wriggled out into the magical world. She twisted vines over the hole in the hedge, and, carrying her basket, walked down the road.\nThe road led down the mountain and through the valley to the city. It was a beautiful morning. A black horse darted close, head held high, breath misting in the air. It wheeled and turned away, flashing shimmery wings. Wild turkeys scattered across the road, burbling, \u201cCome on come on come on come on.\u201d\nThe road curved.\nSoon, she came upon a tall, handsome boy leaning against a truck. Her first stranger! Every quest needs an ally, and plus, he had a truck.\n\u201cCan you take me to the city?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said.\nTiger told the boy about her quest for the elixir as they drove. In the fields, shallow pools reflected cumulus clouds and sky.\n\u201cI know a pharmacy where they got that stuff,\u201d the boy told her. \u201cI\u2019ll take you. It\u2019s expensive, though. You got money?\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t. All she had was her broth and eggs.\n\u201cYou sure are pretty,\u201d he said, and took her hand. He was so handsome, and she wanted to kiss him.\nThey were down in the valley now. In the distance, the golden skyline of the city rested upon a cloud. The closer they got, the stronger the magic became. Little imps rose out of the mist and sparkled and popped. The air darkened. The ground on each side of the road began to bubble. Now the golden city was right in front of them.\n\u201cWe\u2019re almost to the pharmacy,\u201d the boy said. \u201cI\u2019m sure you can trade something for that elixir.\u201d\nHis eyes glittered. She noticed something odd about his face; his smooth chin looked suddenly dark and rough, but she blinked and it was smooth again.\nAs they cruised the streets, Tiger noted that the city was just a village with rickety fa\u00e7ades of gold leaf and glittering rhinestones. The streets were filled with people, all beautiful and young, but their lips were puffy, their foreheads blank, and many had scars along their jaw lines. Their eyes were dull.\nShe heard her mother\u2019s voice in her head: \u201cBeauty is only skin deep.\u201d\nThe boy stopped at a blue traffic light. From the corner of her eye, Tiger saw a grinning troll face, but when she turned and looked, it was just the boy. Her heart beat faster but she didn\u2019t say anything. She needed to find that elixir. The light changed to pink, and the truck lurched ahead.\nTiger had expected the pharmacy to be a small shop, but the boy stopped in front of a slender tower covered in peeling gold paint. \u201cI\u2019ll wait,\u201d he said. He ran one finger down the side of her face, leaving a slimy snail trail. She shuddered, grabbed her basket, and walked into the lobby where an escalator climbed higher than she could see. She took it all the way to the top.\nWhen she got off, she was in a long line of hungry-looking people. \u201cWhat\u2019s this line for?\u201d she asked the woman in front of her. Tiger guessed this was her second stranger.\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d the woman asked. She tucked her garish red hair behind her ears and patted her lipstick with a tissue. \u201cThey got it all: Botox, fillers, Vitamin B shots, instant lipo, tummy tucks, breast implants, uppers, downers, pot, coke, meth, \u2018ludes, molly, bennies, poppers, peyote, LSD, hair dye, Rogaine, blah blah blah.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just here for the cure for my parents\u2019 exhaustion. They\u2019re fading away!\u201d Tiger\u2019s chin trembled.\nThe woman smirked. \u201cOh. You want the Elixir. Most expensive thing on the menu, honey. Say, what\u2019s in the cute basket? You got anything good in there?\u201d\n\u201cJust a few hard-boiled eggs from my hens.\u201d\n\u201cOrganic? Free range?\u201d The woman\u2019s eyes glittered the way the boy\u2019s had.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cOmegas! Selenium!\u201d the woman exclaimed. \u201cHmm. Maybe I got something.\u201d She pulled a small vial of silver liquid from her bosom. \u201cVoila, The Elixir. Barely used. Trade ya?\u201d\nTiger couldn\u2019t believe her luck. She held out three eggs, and the woman snatched them.\n\u201cOne drop per decade you wanna shed. Five drops to live forever,\u201d the woman said.\nTiger tucked the vial in her basket and descended the escalator, victorious.\nThe truck engine was still running. \u201cDid you get the stuff?\u201d the boy leered.\nHis chin had sprouted a thick scruff, and Tiger hadn\u2019t noticed how small his hands were, how dirty his nails. She got in. He reached for her basket. Tiger pulled it away and tucked it on the other side of her. He was the only person she knew, and she had no money. They drove through the city, deeper into the dark twisting streets.\n\u201cAren\u2019t we going home?\u201d Tiger asked.\nBut the troll just grinned.\nAgain, Tiger heard her mother\u2019s voice in her head: \u201cUse your wits.\u201d So, she leaned over, seized the steering wheel, and twisted. The truck bounced off the street and slammed into a building. The troll\u2019s head smashed hard against the window, and popped off, bloodless, with a sound like a snapping carrot. It bounced into her lap still grinning.\nWhen Tiger stopped screaming, she shoved the head off her lap, grabbed her basket, jumped out of the truck, and ran.\nEventually she slowed. She was on the outskirts of the city now. She sat on a boulder and tried to calm down. She opened her broth, took a sip, and felt its warmth fill her body. She peeled an egg and took a bite.\nThen, she saw a big brown dog with prominent ribs peering at her with soulful eyes. Her third stranger. She was still reeling from the horrible troll, but the dog gave a timid wag.\n\u201cCome here,\u201d Tiger said gently. \u201cCome on.\u201d\nHe came closer.\n\u201cWould you like some broth?\u201d she asked.\nHe thumped his tail.\n\u201cI have an egg, too. Would you like an egg?\u201d\n\u201cYes, please,\u201d the dog said.\nTiger held out the jug and helped the dog take a sip, and then she peeled him an egg and they sat chewing thoughtfully.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u201cDog,\u201d he said. \u201cCan I come home with you?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s go, Dog,\u201d she said, her heart already full of love for him.\nThey walked home for three days. They ate the remaining eggs and sipped broth. Then they found fruit from trees. Tiger ate that. Dog went off in the woods and found bones. Dog was a dog of few words, but his eyes were bright and loving. They slept curled in ditches and under trees, Dog, her ally, there to protect her from trolls.\nApproaching the tall hedge, Tiger saw that the small hole she\u2019d made was now much bigger, its edges blackened and burnt. Tiger and Dog walked easily through. They were home.\nBut magic had crept in through the breach while Tiger was gone, and things were changing. It was all four seasons at once now: snow bent the heads of small trees; a fairy ring of mushrooms had popped up on the lawn; the summer corn was ready for harvest, yellow leaves fell from the oaks. They passed the chicken yard and Tiger noticed that the hens\u2019 combs had turned blue. Dog sniffed at everything in delight.\n\u201cLet\u2019s get my parents the elixir,\u201d Tiger said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to love them.\u201d\nInside, the house was quiet and the woodstove had gone out. It took her a while to find them, curled like commas in bed, under a pile of quilts, husks of themselves, withered and dried. At first she thought they were dead. Then they rolled over, wrinkled cheeks smiling weakly, and slowly sat up.\n\u201cI\u2019m home! And here\u2019s Dog, who\u2019s come to live with us.\u201d Her dad extended his hand and Dog sniffed. \u201cBut most important, I got the elixir! Now you can live forever and never age!\u201c\nHer mother croaked, \u201cNo, dear, it\u2019s too late.\u201d\nHer father wheezed, \u201cNot just too late, I don\u2019t want it.\u201d\n\u201cPlease?\u201d she pleaded. \u201cFather, you\u2019ll be able to ride across the fields again; Mother, I\u2019ll brush your long black locks, and you won\u2019t be so exhausted all the time.\u201d\nDog, at the foot of the bed, hung his hound-dog head.\nFinally her mother agreed, \u201cIf you really want us to, dear.\u201d\nTriumphant, Tiger opened the magic vial. She put one drop, two drops, five shining drops of silver on her mother\u2019s outstretched tongue.\nThey waited. But nothing happened. Tiger covered her face with her hands. Her parents\u2019 hair was white as the snow on the cedars, and now they would die.\nHer mother said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, dear. Those magic people might be beautiful on the outside, but underneath they\u2019re just monsters.\u201d\nTiger closed her eyes and wept. She had failed.\nDog licked her cheek. \u201cBroth,\u201d he said.\nTiger opened her eyes. Dog was right; her parents looked hungry. They looked thirsty.\nShe had just a little bone broth left in the jug; she helped each of them swallow a few sips. They all held hands as the color rose again in her parents\u2019 cheeks.\nBoth of them were so old, but so beautiful.\nIt was good to be home.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Their battered heads fall, childlike in the mist, leaning down to the ground as if in sleep or shame.\nBats have been flying round the flowers, he thinks, returning to bed and to his sleeping wife, Silvia. Gently, he pulls the sheet over her shoulders and settles into her warmth.\nHe wakes to find the bedroom faintly lit by moonlight, and Silvia gone. She\u2019s nowhere in the house.\nNear midnight in pouring rain he drives with the brights on through the windy neighborhood. Silvia walks barefoot in her dripping nightgown in the middle of the street. Headlights fall on her, and she shields her face. He jumps out of the driver\u2019s seat and pulls her into the sedan.\nSilvia has been sleepwalking ever since her sister Ashley died.\nWhen she wasn\u2019t researching, Ashley lectured on the way trees keep people alive by absorbing and storing carbon dioxide. A biologist studying deforestation, erosion, and greenhouse gasses, Ashley left the United States on a green grant to collect soil, water, and air samples in Central and South America, western and Central Africa, western India, Southeast Asia, and the island of New Guinea. Ashley had disappeared in Australia, and was presumed dead.\n* * *\nSilvia stopped sleeping. After laying awake one night, she ventured into the dark backyard at sunrise and encountered a sculpted body of branches in bloom, spun with honeysuckle, behind the shed: a masculine head carved of curious mist crowned by yellow dahlias, hands of lilies with metallic green hummingbirds flitting over fingertips of fungi.\nLike a man, it was walking behind the neighbor\u2019s shed in the shadow of white figs.\nThe figure caught Silvia, held her down, and kissed her sharply with a thorny tongue that placed a seed inside her mouth. It held her mouth shut until she swallowed the seed. Or so Silvia said, pointing to the backyard outside the kitchen window.\n\u201cThat\u2019s where he disappeared, into dahlias, to become a pile of yard cuttings.\u201d\n\u201cHe?\u201d Raymond said. \u201cThis was a dream. You finally fell asleep. You were sleepwalking because of those sleeping pills. They\u2019re dangerous, honey.\u201d\n\u201cIt was a man,\u201d said Silvia. \u201cI cut him with the clippers, and watched his branches bleed.\u201d\n\u201cStop taking those damn pills.\u201d\nAccording to Silvia, the man\u2019s body was a tree and his hair was vine. He called to her at night, pulling her out of her dreams, leading her deeper into leaves. His eyes were locusts, his face webbed.\nHe kissed her, filling her mouth with flowers before whispering, Ashley?\n* * *\nIn Sylvia\u2019s bruises, splashed over her pale flesh like sooty water, Raymond spies two girls. Sisters. The bruises color as she heals, black to blue to violet to burgundy to grayish pink to light green and brownish yellow, finally fading in long thin scratches, like claw marks scoring her arms and legs.\nWine-colored twigs sprout from Silvia\u2019s arms as he plucks weeds from her back.\nSilvia kisses Raymond deeply, and his mouth fills with petals.\n* * *\n\u201cThis is where,\u201d Silvia says, pointing to an abrasion on her left shoulder where lichen grows. \u201cIt aches.\u201d\nBruises peel away from Silvia\u2019s skin and fall as leaves fluttering down to the hardwood.\n\u201cKilling trees poisons the air,\u201d she whispers, breathing honeysuckle into Raymond\u2019s mouth.\nOn the television screen, Ashely clings to the glass podium like a lover: Clearcutting is mass murder, but from the moment of the murderous act, it takes decades for the deaths to happen. Everyone in our time is passively participating. Through global warming, we\u2019re all serial killers.\nRaymond wonders if it could be true, if deforestation murders people he\u2019ll never meet. If the victims live in a future he\u2019ll never see and die in the future because of trees cut down today.\n* * *\nSilvia coughs white petals while disguising herself in dirt and shadow. Somnambulism, that lovely, soft word, captures nothing of its danger. Noctambulism is better. The doctors say Silvia is merely sleepwalking. Raymond wants to watch her day and night, but he has to work during the day and sleep at night.\nThat\u2019s why he ties her to the bedposts with a long rope binding her wrists and ankles.\n\u201cGentle,\u201d Silvia says, \u201cbut not too gentle.\u201d\n* * *\nFinding her gone, her side of the bed empty and warm near untied ropes, he rushes out barefoot in the torrential rain and runs through dark streets before realizing he needs to circle back for the sedan.\nOut of breath after starting the sedan, he notices the flower garden in his headlights. Light pools over Silvia\u2019s naked body.\nCrushing dahlias, she\u2019s sleeping drenched, surrounded by dragonflies and mint. By dawn\u2019s first light Raymond digs her legs out of the garden. He plucks her arms like pulling a large plant from the dirt. Toes plunging deeply into wet sod like roots, her fingers clutch earth, as if burying herself. As if the Earth doesn\u2019t want to give her up.\nPrying her from the dirt, he carries her through the yard.\nBlood-blotched dahlias straighten in mist as he stumbles under her weight. Swatting circling insects, Raymond cradles her nakedness. A faint whiff of skunk drifts toward aggressive mint blossoming in Silvia\u2019s hair, attracting hordes of bees, butterflies. Sylvia opens her mouth; black swallowtails sail through, wings splashed in midnight blue.\nPollinators light on her nipples, which smell of giant flowers. Wasps swarm.\nIn the house, Raymond closes all the windows and locks her in the bedroom to protect her from insects. With a tiny flashlight, he examines the bruises blooming in black dahlias on her pale arms and discovers weeds growing from her armpits. Her bruises now have new shapes, patterns of blood evolving into a face imprinted on a tree.\n* * *\nThe next night Raymond finds Silvia walking down the dark cul-de-sac near greenspace. She clings to saplings in the nude. The night after he finds her on an overpass in her gown, walking so close to the edge of the tree line. He wants to call to her, to scream her name. He remembers not to yell or wake her. If startled, she might fall into traffic.\nMoths flex their wings around her eyes.\nShe darts under the railroad bridge where fire pits glow. Among the oaks, she crawls into tree-hidden caravans. Enormous webs sparkle in distant streetlight. Beneath silver maples, a man\u2019s shadow becomes the shadow of branches in the darkness.\n* * *\nBecause Silvia hasn\u2019t slept for days, she must sleep now that she has taken her pills. Her dark hair springs from the pillow like an unruly bush. Raymond covers her nakedness with a soft pink blanket. She\u2019s sticky and smells of sap. A tiny twig sprouts from the hairs of her left nostril. He attempts to remove the twig deep inside her nose. Seeds drop from her hands. Pollen clings to her fingernails etched in leafy veins.\n* * *\nCaught in motion-sensor lights outside the bedroom window, the porch swing sways near the sedan as if someone has been sitting there. It\u2019s like a game \u2014 someone is there, someone Raymond can\u2019t see, waiting beyond his field of vision.\nInside the bedroom where Silvia is sleeping, a willowy shadow in the mirror travels among silhouettes of chairs, lamps, and tables. Blood trails from the kitchen to Silvia on the bed near rust-colored stains.\nIn the bathroom, Raymond showers, wraps a thick towel around his waist, and then stumbles into the kitchen. He takes stock of the recent remodeling as he brews a pot of strong coffee. Stainless steel appliances, ceramic tile flooring, granite countertops, everything Silvia wanted has been splotched with blood. Reaching for bleach and paper towels, Raymond stares at the coffeemaker, which hisses.\nAs he watches coffee drip, he thinks of the way Silvia used to nestle beside him.\nPale light rises behind the pines, clouds whitening sky. Raymond sits on his back porch as sunlight gleams over the aluminum carport. He imagines Silvia\u2019s dark curls rooting across the embroidered pillowcase, pink threads silken. The yard flutters with birds, opossums watching from oaks below a nest of squirrels circling, chasing each other across the bark. Behind the pines, power lines cut through greenspace behind the cyclone fence.\n* * *\nThe next evening at the neighborhood watch meeting a cop lectures on safety. The cop tells everyone to keep their eyes peeled, to look out for anyone who isn\u2019t where they are supposed to be.\nRaymond thinks of Silvia peeling the lids away from her eyes. He feels unnerved and leaves the meeting early to examine a place in his backyard where two fig trees grow close together, easy for a man to hide behind in the dark.\nApproaching his house from the back, Raymond creeps like a trespasser to gaze at Silvia through the bedroom window. Inside, Silvia brushes songbirds out of her long black hair. Dragonflies mate in tandem above Silvia\u2019s unruly curls. She tears from her scalp tangles and hunks of hair, snagged on long vines.\n* * *\n\u201cFigs,\u201d Raymond whispers the next day when trying to think of an excuse to inspect his backyard and the neighbor\u2019s yard by morning light. Only last week, his nearest neighbor, an elderly retired teacher, showed him her gun collection as she rocked on her porch swing with seventeen-year locusts buzzing near her roses.\nGazing out at the fig trees, Raymond wonders about the animals living in the branches at the end of summer. He\u2019s trying not to think about what Silvia confessed about the man who waits for her where the fig trees grow.\nThe trees are alive with animals shacking up in the heavy branches, ravaging delicate fruit hidden behind dark leaves. Birds shake the trees. Leaping and diving, they make the leaves shiver and dance. Raymond imagines what hides in the shadows of the branches fed by fruit ripening in the sun.\nMint flowers in the garden, aggressive weeds taking over; bees swarm the swallowtails, black and yellow. The floodlight dahlias mix into roses near blackberries and grapes.\nCrows light on the roofs of the storage buildings and dive into the leaves of the fig trees. This is how Raymond knows the figs are ready for Silvia. She craves figs a certain way \u2014 mature, ripe.\nA white radiator sits abandoned near the fig trees. Raymond approaches the radiator. He wonders what it\u2019s doing there, ruined by rain and covered in a spatter of rust like dried blood.\nHe reaches for the figs. He fills his hands with figs. He will feed them to her.\nThe figs are so fragile they split and drip all over the carpet when pinched by her gritty lips.\nRaymond loves the fragility, watching Silvia\u2019s brittle nose grow sticky with her smile. As delicate as she appears, he understands that she will never again be like other women.\nHer future ends in a grove, not a grave. Her heart is heartwood. The boughs of her arms house butterflies. Roots from her hips, a lengthy taupe skirt trailing her ankles, pull water to her trunk.\nSilvia feeds wildlife the fruits of her body. Her flowers, pollinated by wind, are covered by tufts of stiff hair. Globe-shaped blossoms, her sensitive breasts swell as nutlets mature inside her.\nIf Silvia is becoming the thing her sister died to save, Raymond wonders how long she can remain in bloom.\nShe is cherry tree and hawthorn, a nesting site for birds, a woman of dark red fruits ripening on the zigzagging stems of her ribs. She branches with blossoms, her floral scent filling their house, swelling with bees, birds, fireflies, and butterflies.\nHer arms grow through the windows, and Raymond counts the dragonflies as friends. He kisses her often, and with every kiss he becomes further entangled in the sunlit canopy of her hair.\nBetween her legs, olives grow, ripening from green to black to brown.\n\u201cThe blood tree is real,\u201d says Silvia as she feeds Raymond. \u201cAshley sent its seeds to me, and I swallowed them.\u201d\nRaymond often stays up at night, listening to Ashley\u2019s podcasts. Even after her death, Ashley is still teaching people how plants keep people alive.\nDeforestation is mass suicide. Violence against nature is violence against people.\nRaymond wonders if Ashley went somewhere she wasn\u2019t supposed to go, following paths through dense forests until they ended. Before Ashley disappeared, she theorized the forest\u2019s struggle for survival would become the world\u2019s struggle.\nIn a podcast shortly before her disappearance, Ashley relates a dream, inspired by folktales, in which she discovered a tree that bled human blood in the Congo, where she was courted in the forest by a man whose body was a tree and whose hair was vine.\nSearchers in the Congo found leopards, and buzzards scattering remains camouflaged in wild flowers blooming near a stream. The decayed body, nude, devoured by insects, no longer resembled a woman.\n\u201cAshley invited this,\u201d whispers Silvia, her breath mist.\nSilvia\u2019s wet mouth is like a flowerpot busted in the rain, dripping moistened dirt onto the figs in his fingers. Her thorny tongue grates against earthworms, writhing behind muddy brown teeth, to reveal a tiny seedling growing inside her throat.\nRaymond sees the man of branches in the trees of the backyard. His hands of honeysuckle bejeweled with metallic green hummingbirds.\nRaymond envisions predators and insects. Somewhere in the trees, flowers bloom near a clear stream carrying strands of Ashley\u2019s hair.\nRaymond longs to see the blood tree.\n\u201cWhere is it?\u201d he says, losing patience.\n\u201cLook,\u201d she says. \u201cCome here. Get closer.\u201d","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Now they\u2019re in great demand, scuttling along the sides of buildings as they deliver packages through the windows, and leaping from station to station, track to track in the subway.\nMother used to hold me on her lap and gently stroke my two little feet, reassuring me that I was special in my own way, but still I\u2019d cry and ask why I had to be born so limited.\n\u201cThe Holy Trinity of Amazon, FedEx, and UPS\u201d \u2014 and here she\u2019d half-close her eyes as she moved her fingers through the air with the sign of the sacred dollar \u2014 \u201cuse algorithms for the number of runners to genetically engineer; we mustn\u2019t question their ways.

There are many cuckoo clocks and all of them cuckoo at the wrong time. They sound more like a flock of birds than timepieces.\nI love that none of the clocks tell the right time because I have absolutely no desire to know what time it is. Time is a prison that kills your life. All you\u2019re really counting are the hours, minutes, and seconds till your death. And the time of my death I definitely don\u2019t want to know. Everybody says they\u2019d love to know when they die, but if you know that you just waste all your time trying to avoid the unavoidable.\nThis is why I feel that knowing what time it is just leads to madness. Which is why I take special care to randomly reset the times on my clocks and always wind them at different times. If I had it my way, my broken clocks wouldn\u2019t even tell the right time once a day.\nMy obsession with destroying time is the reason I live in a house full of broken clocks. I feel like I\u2019m a mad scientist and my experiments with my broken clocks might somehow destroy the chronological order of things. Imagine a world without schedules or appointments, where we all lived in an ecstasy of spontaneous random activity. Some would call it madness but I\u2019m trying to get my madness to infect all of time.\nOne day I was finally successful.\nI had stopped resetting my clocks randomly and had instead started setting them at times that, while wrong, were in sequence with each other based on some mathematical variables I\u2019d read about recently in an article on quantum physics.\nMy goal was to find the ultimate random event, a measurement of time so obscure it would punch a hole in the fabric of reality and cause time to actually flow in a different direction. Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity states that even the act of observing and measuring something can have an effect on the object being observed and measured. What if the effect could actually change the object?\nMy experiments were like pulling a single stone out of the bottom of a dam that would let loose a great flood. For weeks I had been resetting all the clocks based on variables extrapolated from the square root of phi, but I was getting nowhere.\nThen, just as a joke, I started resetting the clocks based on variables of the number 666.\nOn the thirteenth night it happened. Even though every clock in the house was set at a different time, all the cuckoos sang at once. Time stopped. All the events of our lives took place simultaneously in one overwhelming now. The single moment drowned out all other moments and for one shining second we were all one.\nWhen time restarted, it was going in a different direction. It actually had no direction at all. Instead of occurring in a chronological sequence, all events occurred randomly. It was like you could die the day after your second birthday and then celebrate your fiftieth birthday the day after. Time had become utterly absurd.\nBut absolutely no one noticed. Not a single person. That\u2019s because when you are in the time stream it is the only timeline you can perceive and therefore it makes perfect sense to you no matter how senseless it is. Everyone on Earth was living their life in a completely random and sporadic way, but it all seemed completely normal.\nI was the only one who wasn\u2019t viewed as normal. Because even in this new reality of radically altered time, time that had been redirected by my own efforts, I was the man who had moved the universe, but was still just viewed as a crazy old man who lived in the middle of a junkyard tinkering with old broken clocks.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

The circle bounces up and down in agreement with the bass; Yu nods at the audience in rhythm with their rhythm with him.\nYu is sort of absent-minded but probably the best barbershop quartet singer the world has ever seen.\nShucks, do you really think so?\nWell, yeah, when you remember to sing.\nYu has a poorly concealed habit of talking to himself. And when I say that Yu is absent-minded, I don\u2019t mean that Yu forgets his keys or to pick up his laundry or to feed the dog (to feed his mother\u2019s dog I should say \u2014 his mother forgets). Yu is pretty good at that stuff. He keeps a good schedule. No.\nWhen I say that Yu is absent-minded, I mean that he will, very often, during songs, forget which song he is singing. Sometimes he\u2019ll forget that he is singing altogether.\nIn addition to singing (which he really just picked up as a side thing to stay active in the performing arts) he runs a costume-by-order boutique, teaches dance at an after-school program, volunteers at a shelter, and works as a freelance laborer on Sundays for pocket change.\nSleep when you\u2019re dead. No rest for the wicked. Yu is big on mantras that make industriousness sound sort of unsavory.\nYu made the costumes for his quartet today. It\u2019s the classic: red and white vertically striped vests, white shirts, arm bands, black slacks, black shoes, straw boater caps with red ribbons, and everyone has a fake plastic handlebar mustache except for Yu, who grew one.\n\u201cEverybody wants to be a cat,\u201d they sing.\nYu is the only member who spent the extra duckets on a cane, too.\n\u201cBecause the cat\u2019s the only cat \u2014\u201d\nYu reminds himself that his mother will be joining him at class this week as the circle dances in what cannot be described as perfect circles.\nII\nYu is tapping at his raised desk with the flat end of his pen, estimating the day\u2019s earnings in his head.\nHe understands these to be two of his bad habits \u2014 he is prone to thoughtless, nervous gestures like tapping his pen or cracking his knuckles or blinking too much or tweezing the odd ends of his mustache or making little squares in the air with his index finger. He also knows these innumerable mental calculations would work better on paper. After all, he is more inclined to error when not keeping records, and, more to the point, all of his goals and ambitions will mean very little when he forgets them. He has wanted to put an extension on the store for three years now, for instance.\n\u201cYous!\u201d\nCharlie, the owner of practically the whole block, and live-in manager of the bar next door, opens the door of Yu\u2019s boutique with a shove and raises both arms into the air as if he is very, very welcome, expecting a hug.\nQueen Ursula, Yu\u2019s mother and self-assigned Helper, switches directions and speeds to the back of the store labeled INTERNAL PROCESSING the moment Charlie appears in front of the plate glass windows.\n\u201cHey, Queenie,\u201d Charlie calls, \u201cI\u2019m seeing a lot of your back these days\u201d \u2014 the door under the internal processing sign swings shut and continues to swing on its hinge \u2014 \u201cand I like it.\u201d\nCharlie winks at Yu, Queen Ursula gives Charlie the finger from behind the still-swinging but not at all open door, and Yu steps out from behind the register, stretches his arms, and tells Charlie to come in, come in, and know me better, man.\nIII\nCardboard mats, a necessity for PS 187\u2019s polyurethane-slick gymnasium floor, are only one of the costume items Yu brings to every single session of Friday\u2019s \u201cBreaking in The Weekend\u201d (Queen Ursula\u2019s coinage), Yu\u2019s after school dance program.\nYu knows the importance of a costume better than he knows how to breakdance. So Fridays generally go like this: Yu shows up at PS 187\u2019s heavy-duty metal door with a giant box full of Kangols and Shelltops and tracksuits and athletic shirts and plastic rope-chains and full-hand rings, checks in with security, lays out cardboard mats in a style similar to that of an aerobics class, and waits for the youth of the day to come in, settle, and teach him how to breakdance.\nQueen Ursula admires him from her discreetly-placed chair at the far side of the gymnasium. The first wave of elementary school students burst in through the door like something electric. She knows that he knows there is no way those cardboard mats will stay in their places through the two hour \u201cdance class.\u201d\nStill, week after week, Yu expertly plots their distances among and between one another. Dancers should be close enough to watch and observe and garner excitement from one another, but physical contact must be avoided at all costs.\nAs with all of his jobs, Yu is meticulous, but a little scattered, she thinks, as the second battering ram of prepubescents slams the gym door wide.\nThe kids are now climbing Yu. She isn\u2019t delusional. She knows that Yu takes pride, maybe too much, in all he does.\nIt\u2019s Friday, the kids just got out, and based on the energy level in the room, Yu might not be able to begin for another half-hour.\nBut Queen Ursula has what we might call the gift of Augmentation. Queen Ursula the Augmentor, she calls herself. She also knows something that her son doesn\u2019t, can\u2019t. The thing about her son, the value of Yu that might or might not be there whether she was present, is that the mustaches, the rope-chains, the boater hats, the perfect spacing of the mats, the endless flourishes, the hundreds upon hundreds of little disguises her son wears and designs \u2014 he may pretend and simulate and masquerade and delude, but Yu does not impersonate concern.\nYu carries his concern in a box with him and is humbled for you to borrow it.\nSo when that prick Charlie comes in all happy and huggy and ready to half-growl, half-giggle over the rent that may well be a little late, Queen Ursula the Augmentor is always just about prepared to shove off and add a little something to his frame of reference, too.\nWizard and Tanner are hanging from Yu\u2019s hands like pails of water. Yu responds by spinning around and around at irresponsibly fast speeds. Many kids who show up don\u2019t even pretend they\u2019re going to dance, and their flock is forming in a distant corner, so class may well begin within twenty minutes after all.\nSeveral of the overhead bulbs are flickering.\nYu\u2019s revolutions are reaching carnival ride speeds. Wizard and Tanner are parallel to the gym floor.\nThe apex of nurturing is behavioral adaptation. Cute.\nTanner slips from Yu\u2019s hand and crashes against the wall of the gymnasium, which is covered with blue foam, but still. Tanner is down. Yu places the other pail softly on the floor. Yu crouches over Tanner, his left knee on a cardboard mat, his right foot propped up on the gymnasium floor, his left hand against the wall\u2019s padded blue, his right hand lightly touching Tanner\u2019s shoulder.\nA chameleon overbooked.\nSummoning some strength, Ursula shrinks before she stands.\n\u201cTanner, get up. We\u2019re going to the nurse,\u201d she yells.\nYu snaps to the front of the room, clapping his hands. The students who are going to be teaching Yu to dance are clapping, too. Class begins ahead of schedule.\nIV\nLights Out at the homeless shelter. Rain patters against the basement windows. Fluorescent lights cover the entirety of the den of St. Dymphna\u2019s, and take several minutes to go completely dark. The bells that indicate Lights Out could therefore more accurately be said to indicate Lights Gray. A dull, gray glow, compounded by the dust.\nAnd the smell. The rot\u2019s noxiousness can almost be seen, like the rainbow ribbons of oil on water. Queen Ursula the Augmentor is compelled to talk about these rainbows.\nIt isn\u2019t a huge space. On Saturday nights between 40 and 60 of the city\u2019s homeless perch abstractly on green-grey cots and remove the boots that barely require removing and cover themselves with thin, blue, wool blankets.\nLast week Yu brought sixty Franciscan Friar Habits. Ant and Day are not the only two still wearing them, but they may be the only two who have not taken any liberties with Yu\u2019s instruction on how to wear a Franciscan Friar Habit.\nAnt and Day sit upright on the center of their cots, facing each other. Yu and Queen Ursula kneel north and south of Ant and Day at the head and foot of their respective cots. The bell chimes.\nYU: Do you guys want to say a prayer?\nQUA: I\u2019ll chant.\nANT: Been confessing all week. Nothing left.\nDAY: Let\u2019s ask for something.\nYU: We could ask for blessings.\nQUA: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet, Red, Orange, \u2026\nANT: Better yet, let\u2019s give thanks.\nDAY: Better still, why don\u2019t you guys get the fuck out of here?\nYU: Thank you for the broth we drank tonight, and thank you for bringing us here, together.\nQUA: Violet, Red, Orange, Yellow, \u2026\nANT: It\u2019s a real treat.\nDAY: It\u2019s a fucking celebration.\nYU: Thank you for the Joy I feel tonight, here, among friends.\nQUA: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, \u2026\nANT: Thank you for only taking the digits I didn\u2019t need and for ruining my sense of taste.\nDAY: Hearing you speak, Yu\u2014it\u2019s like listening to myself be lobotomized.\nYU: How should we pray?\nQUA: A few words for the confused.\nANT: Oh, oh, oh, we could pray about learning to pray!\nDAY: We could pluck the parasites from the creases of our skin one by one!\nYU: The group has it. A confused prayer about learning to pray for the parasites.\nQUA: Gray-black, fill larger and larger spaces.\nANT: Brother, it is getting dark.\nDAY: Can it\u2014\nANT: Day, if I sleep tonight, will you comfort me?\nDAY: Yes.\nYU: I\u2019m scared.\nQUA: Close our lids. Tighten the case over our lenses.\nYU: Teach me to sit still. Teach me to mean anything.\nQUA: Yu. Qua. Ant. Day.\nANT: They say rain.\nDAY: They say right.\nV\nGot my shovel. Got my health. Two arms. More than most. Many. More than many. Can say. Prosperity by way of comparison. Heave, ho. Heave, ho.\nMa makes dinner tonight. Beef stroganoff or something with egg noodles. Ma loves the egg noodles. Soft, wide. And the egg noodles love her. She\u2019s getting plump.\nYou didn\u2019t have to say that. Whether or not it\u2019s true, you didn\u2019t have to say it.\nWell, you don\u2019t have to listen if you don\u2019t want.\nWell, you don\u2019t have to be here.\nFine, then. I\u2019ll leave. Bye.\nBye. Heave, ho. Heave, ho.\nThe ditches are an easy task after the rains. He knows that. That\u2019s why he put me here. Must think I\u2019m stupid. Or he just doesn\u2019t like me.

Sixteen new heartbreaks.\nThey come down off the boat on unsteady legs. They are sunburnt and sick. Some fall onto the sand and cry. Others stay tall and defiant, clutching their luggage to their sides and looking furtive. No one welcomes them. No one tells them the rules or where to stay or how to live. They have to figure that out for themselves.\nOn Wednesdays, we are encouraged to talk about our pain, but the rest of the week we are discouraged from talking at all.\n\u201cI let my fingernails grow long and I would scrape the tops of my thighs and my forearms until I bled.\u201d\n\u201cAfter I lost my job, I would eat cereal straight from the box and then go stand in front of the open fridge to wash it down with milk. I stopped showering. He gave me something to look forward to. A reason to wake up in the morning.\u201d\n\u201cI fell in love with his words, not the picture. The pictures, even the, you know, sexy ones, they meant nothing to me. When he called me his angel, I was, I am, in love with the man who wrote those beautiful words. My soulmate was on the other side of the phone. I know this. And he\u2019s wondering where I am.\u201d\nMy son-in-law\u2014one of the lawyers of the landmark class action suit\u2014insisted that I be one of the first to go to the Island of Free Women. I couldn\u2019t be trusted with technology, he\u2019d said.\nI packed my curling iron and 21-step skincare regime for anti-aging. I brought a selection of cruise wear that billowed around my waist to hide my problem areas. I arrived with six pairs of leggings and two yoga mats of varying thickness. When the last of my night serums were gone, I cried myself to sleep on a bed of yoga mats.\nMy hut, though lopsided and basically useless when it rains, is ample. I worry that as more women arrive, I\u2019ll be asked to share. For the first few months, I was alone in this section of the island. I chose a corner of a bluff overlooking the western shore. It took me four days to clear out the brush and remove all the rocks \u2014 though that included multiple breaks where I wandered down to the ocean and let the water bury my feet up to my ankles in sand.\nThat\u2019s what I was doing when I found the first bottle.\nThe boats bringing new women also deliver pallets of food and supplies. These are stored in the communal pantry. Today, I showed up for dried pasta, matches, toothpaste, and a new spoon (I used the other one to dig a second toilet hole), but I timed it to catch a glimpse of the arrivals.\nI don\u2019t usually participate on Wednesdays, but when there is a new crop, I\u2019ll listen from outside the circle.\n\u201cMy husband held my head to the floor until I gave him the passcode to my phone.\u201d\n\u201cNo one thinks they would be dumb enough to fall for something like that until they do. I have a master\u2019s degree.\u201d\n\u201cI gave him my life savings, $15,000 in six months. \u2018Trust me once more,\u2019 he said each time. I would do it again just for one more message.\u201d\n\u201cHe reminded me of my son.\u201d\n\u201cBefore the day he was supposed to fly in, I plucked every single pube. I didn\u2019t want to shave and have fuzz. I wanted him to think that I was naturally hairless. But the roots bled and I looked like a plucked chicken down there. It looked so bad that there was a part of me that was relieved when he didn\u2019t show up.\u201d\n\u201cI was doing good. Or if not good, better. But yesterday, I picked up a fast food chicken cup. He always would talk about how much he missed fried chicken while serving in Afghanistan.\u201d\nEven before we arrived, Henderson Island had notoriety in the outside world.\nThe crew of a whaling ship in 1820 spent some time as castaways here before they were rescued a year later. They reported finding human skeletons in a cave, presumably the remains of a less fortunate crew.\nThen, in the early 2010s, environmentalists were shocked to discover piles of plastic garbage washing up on these pink sands.\nThe world\u2019s largest social media site was awarded the island (in addition to a number of environmental prizes) for successfully cleaning up the beaches in 2019. They didn\u2019t know what to do with the gift, and the ocean plastic kept swirling. Then came the settlement, and some bright marketing executive suggested dealing with two problems at once: create the court-mandated \u201csafe refuge\u201d for the victims of internet love scams on their site \u2014 and keep the beaches of Henderson Island plastic-free.\nIt is an elegant solution. We, the women who could not be trusted with the technology and the temptations of our modern era, spend our days picking up after the rest of the world.\nSome of us are more diligent about our duties than others. There are women who just sit on rocks and stare at the sea, day after day. But I like to keep busy.\nAnd I don\u2019t want anyone else to find a bottle.\nEvery morning and evening I circumnavigate the island. Any plastic I collect gets dropped into the bins by the main dock. When the boats come to drop off more women and deliver supplies, they take away the trash. We generate very little, ourselves. Henderson Island just happens to be at the epicenter of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.\n\u201cI only opened up my messages when I was walking the dog. I couldn\u2019t trust myself to read them even in a different room of the house from my husband. That poor dog! I would take her on four, five walks a day sometimes. Her legs were so short. She\u2019d be exhausted, but I had to read his reply.\u201d\n\u201cMy granddaughter showed me pages and pages of profiles, all with the same picture of my Jordan, but with different names. That\u2019s when I knew I was never going to meet him. Not for real.\u201d\nI begin my nightly fire-making ritual before the sun goes below the highest part of the island, the volcano. When the sun sets completely, the island is bathed in blackness until the moon rises.\nThat first night after a drop off, in the darkest hour, I can hear the new arrivals wailing. I wait for some of them to come to my fire. If they do, I will give them a torch and tell them to stick it upright in the sand next to a dead log on the beach. I share my fire willingly, but not my company.\nJust when I am about to turn in, down where the water laps at the island, moonlight glints off glass and pierces my eye. I stumble to the shore on cold, bare feet. For a moment I fear it is empty. Just trash instead of hope. But there is paper inside. It takes me several minutes to remove the cap because I am fumbling with excitement. I am shaking. I use my shiny new spoon handle to work the scroll out of the thin neck.\nThe message is cruelly short. Just one page. But he writes of love and longing in his own way. He always misspells the same simple words. That\u2019s how I know it\u2019s really him, my Andrew.\nHe\u2019s filled the margins with smiles and hearts. He asks me to trust him again. Just this one more time.\nThe paper shakes in my cold grip. All the warmth of the day has faded. The paper slips from my fingers and floats into the sea breeze. I should return to my fire.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Which is fine, that was his call.\nBut then Marty cashed out and hit the road from Attleboro, Massachusetts, with an 80-pound coonhound \u2014 to find someone in the family willing to take Jackson.\nThat was different.\nJackson is the dog Marty, our sister Carole and I grew up with in Sparta. He\u2019s more or less the same dog our mother grew up with in Missouri. Before that, her Uncle Eli had custody for 40-some years in Indiana.\nIt used to be considered an honor.\nThe story is that Eli\u2019s great-grandfather Will, an artillery sergeant, found the dog in a burning cornfield in north Georgia and enlisted him as the mascot of an Ohio mountain-howitzer battery, where Jack attained the honorary rank of corporal.\n(Union bivouacs presumably are where the dog acquired his zeal for salted pork belly.)\nThere\u2019s a faded old wet-plate image that used to hang in our living room \u2013 Sergeant Will and Jack in his blue kepi next to a 12-pounder on Lookout Mountain.\nTwo years later Will brought Jackson home, victorious and deaf. The dog\u2019s been somewhere in our clan ever since.\nHe\u2019s lost a step or two, doesn\u2019t chase tires the way he did in the \u201960s, and he hasn\u2019t been hunting since our Uncle Al died and Marty took him east. The older folks say his speckled coat is grayer than it used to be.\nUnderstand me: I\u2019ve got nothing against Jackson per se. He\u2019s really just a good ol\u2019 farm dog \u2014 always the happy wag, the warm nuzzle and those eager black collodion eyes following you around. If all you want to do in life is raise corn, hunt Rebs and sit on your porch counting fireflies, you couldn\u2019t ask for a better pal.\nBut in all this time Jackson\u2019s never gotten over that hearing loss \u2014 the dog won\u2019t let you out of his sight, not for a minute. He\u2019s terrified he\u2019ll be forgotten.\nLeave him alone in the house and you\u2019ve got a shattered window. Leave him tied out in the yard and you\u2019ll see Jack in your rear view mirror dragging a clothesline of towels and sheets up the street. Generations of teasing kids have played hide and seek only to learn there\u2019s no escape \u2013 once he\u2019s got the scent of your family blood in his nose he\u2019ll find you up a tree or seven miles away at a pizza place.\nNo fence can hold him. A dog sitter won\u2019t do. Neighbors: No way. Kennels won\u2019t take him \u2014 he tunnels, climbs, snaps choke chains, howls a weird decalcifying Helen Keller scream that sets off the other dogs into a tabernacle delirium.\nNo. Jackson comes with. Or somebody draws the short straw and stays home.\nMarty always had more patience on the leash. When he got married he and Jeanine took the dog on their honeymoon \u2014 a driving trip along the northern California coast \u201cin search of Francis Drake.\u201d\nAnd there\u2019s no doubt Jack was present at the creation of their daughter Kim: She was the heir apparent. Like her father she used to snuggle up with Jack to read Shelby Foote and do her geography homework, the two of them snacking on bacon bits and manifest destiny.\nAges ago Sergeant Will taught Jackson the \u201cdeaf and dumb\u201d vocabulary and Marty expanded it to include signs for car-car ride and TV dinner \u2014 but Kimmie claimed to have taught the dog how to read lips too.\nAnd she introduced Jack to the modern wonders of strawberry ice cream \u2013 not cones, ladled out of a cup. Everywhere they went Kim carried their little red plastic spoon, just in case.\nOne day a seminary student was staring in his rear view mirror at a cold sore on his lip, rolled through a red light and plowed into Marty\u2019s car, the passenger side.\nKim died two hours later, internal bleeding. She was 16.\nIt\u2019s ironic. Our kin are scattered all over, probably like yours. Back in the analog days when we were kids, weddings and funerals used to be occasions when people traveled hundreds of miles to sit around eating fried chicken, swapping legends and rubbing Jackson\u2019s huge deaf ears.\nBut at Kimmie\u2019s service the dog limped around reading lips and being avoided. Marty in his neck brace recited a long choking eulogy \u2013 from which I\u2019ve excerpted some of the strawberry details above.\nDuffy, our Aunt Millie\u2019s son, leaned over and whispered, \u201cit sounds like a sales pitch.\u201d\nNobody stepped forward with a new spoon.\nThe next month Carole\u2019s son Mark took off for Florida to clean swimming pools and hasn\u2019t been seen since. My daughter Rose got a job teaching American history in Nashville: two grandbabies later we\u2019re lucky to get pictures at Christmas. Within a year of each other our parents died in Nevada and Maine respectively. Millie matriculated in St. Louis.\nThe funerals got harder and harder for everybody to get to. Duffy\u2019s son Mason joined the navy and started his own dog. Marty\u2019s wife left him \u2014 said it was either her or Jackson.\nMy brother spent the last few years holed up with the war hero, writing \u201cchildren\u2019s books\u201d under a pen name he wouldn\u2019t reveal and working ancestry-dot-com to death.\nI didn\u2019t know Marty was on the lam weaving across our nation\u2019s highways with end-stage pancreatic cancer till Carole called \u2014 right in the middle of a Packer game.\nShe lives in Baltimore. We hadn\u2019t talked in years. She was hiding upstairs in her bedroom, peeking out the window, pretending not to be home. Marty was outside with Jackson, ringing her doorbell, looking in the windows.\nCarole\u2019s voice was panicky: Buddy what am I going to do, Buddy this is insane, Buddy he looks like Night of the Living Dead staggering around out there, Buddy this is not fair, Marty has no right showing up here trying to make me feel this way.\nI told her to call 9-1-1.\nI can\u2019t do that.\nSure you can. Do it. They\u2019ll take Marty to the nearest ICU, which is where he belongs, and they\u2019ll put Jack in the pound.\nBuddy we can\u2019t do that!\nLet that dog find a new family to take over.\nCarole started to say something to the effect of \u201cyou\u2019ve got all that land\u201d and I cut her off cold, no. No.\nThen she squealed Buddy wait a minute \u2026 he just got back into his car, he\u2019s leaving, no, they\u2019re sitting there \u2026 no \u2026 oh Buddy he just waved up here, oh God he saw me, he\u2019s waving goodbye.\nMarty backed out and drove off. Jack stuck his head out the shotgun-side window and stared up at Carole. She commenced to sobbing, wailing, 50 years worth of it, why me, oh God why me, which has always been her favorite line.\nWhat can you do? I listened to this for a good hour. Finally her husband came home. Carole straightened right up. He has no idea what this is about. Nobody does.\nThat was the start of it.\nOver the next couple of weeks I got calls from Raleigh and Cincinnati, Gravois Mills, Missouri, and Anna, Illinois, anywhere Marty could find a leaf on the tree, including a couple of second-cousins I\u2019d never heard of.\nBuddy do something, Buddy he\u2019ll listen to you, Buddy he scared the kids, Buddy he\u2019s going to kill somebody driving around in that condition, Buddy, Buddy, Buddy.\nHe got everybody talking, I\u2019ll give him that. Even my succinct son Ryan called from Walmart, Arkansas. I won\u2019t bore you with his remarks.\nIt was obvious Marty was working his way west and northerly.\nAll of which brings us to four nights ago, Bella\u2019s All-Day Breakfast, a truck stop on 41, roughly an hour from Waupaca, which is where I\u2019ve been living in relative peace. Marty knew better than to show up here unannounced. He called from Bella\u2019s, begging to meet. I said all right, but you stay there.\nI found my brother in a booth by the window, hunched over a cup of cold coffee and a plate of bacon for Jackson, later. He was wearing a Red Sox cap: Crazy-looking tufts of purplish hair were fighting to get out from under it. He looked bad. Sunken eyes, red chemo blotches all over his face and neck, green-gray skin. He stood up to shake hands and almost keeled over.\nYou should be in a hospital, I said.\nHe waved me off bravely, vintage Marty: it\u2019s just a bad cold.\nApparently he considered this comment a joke because he tried to laugh, which started him on a coughing jag. He grabbed a wad of napkins and coughed a stream of loud chunky sounds into it.\nThe waitress was headed our way but she veered off. People at other tables stared.\nWhile this was going on I looked out the window into the parking lot, where I saw Jackson\u2019s staring face in the windshield of Marty\u2019s old Land Rover. He\u2019d parked in the front row, facing our booth, so Jack could take in the proceedings.\nMarty finally pulled himself together, cleared his throat and popped a couple of pain killers. I leaned across and in the nicest possible way said if you start that again I\u2019m calling an ambulance \u2013 you got me? This is bullshit, what you\u2019re doing.\nOut of the blue Marty said: Remember when we were astronauts, Buddy?\nI sat back. Is that what you\u2019ve been sitting here thinking about?\nMarty was referring to a brief period one summer when we converted a deer blind into a space ship: his idea. This old hunting shack was up on stilts, like a prison guard tower, on the edge of a wood overlooking a hay field, with window-slats to shoot out of.\nWe hauled two folding chairs up the ladder and set them side by side, Apollo 11 style. Marty designed a cardboard control panel that we mounted in front us. From this lofty venue we \u201cexplored the planets\u201d with mail-order NASA binoculars, observing all manner of new life forms such as the Europa sea deer and the Saturn ring-tailed fox, breathlessly reporting these findings into a tape recorder for posterity.\nBut the only extraterrestrial we ever came home with was Jackson. And the only time in my life I\u2019ve ever felt like an astronaut was right then, that moment, four nights ago \u2014 sitting across from Marty in the window at Bella\u2019s, with Jackson outside in Marty\u2019s space pod, staring through the windshield at us, reading our lips, like that homicidal computer spying on the astronauts in 2001, judging them.\nI remember, I said.\nMarty smiled. He reached his hand across the table. I let him take my hand.\nMarty said, I wonder if it\u2019s still there.\n(It isn\u2019t.) I said that was a long time ago, kid.\nHe nodded. His eyes got glassy. He stared at me with those wet-plate Jackson eyes. Buddy what happened to us?\nI did not reply.\nMarty reached into his coat and pulled out a brown envelope. It was marked \u201cJackson.\u201d He moved it across the table toward me. He said this is all I\u2019ve got Buddy.\nI looked inside. It was cash, thick bundles of cash. Marty said think of it as boarding fee. You never know, Bud, maybe someday Ryan or Rose will come home.\nI shoved the envelope back at him. I wanted to slap him. This is exactly what\u2019s wrong, Marty. You make it too goddamn hard for people. Don\u2019t you see that? You make it too hard.\nMarty looked at me. He never did get it.\n* * * * *\nLast night I got a call from the chief of the park police at Point Reyes National Seashore (north of San Francisco) asking do you have a brother, Martin.\nNow hear this.\nThere\u2019s a famous old lighthouse on a cliff at Point Reyes, you\u2019ve probably seen pictures. I looked it up online: It\u2019s a tourist site now, a museum. Apparently that\u2019s where Marty and Jackson ran out of road. Somehow they broke in there, spent the night in the lighthouse.\nYesterday morning the \u201cresident ranger\u201d found an empty box of strawberry ice cream and Jackson wandering around by himself in the so-called mirror room, doing his Helen Keller howl.\nThe chief said we\u2019ve had teams searching the area all day \u2014 volunteers, divers, not a trace. The tides are extremely powerful here.\nI was the only family member he\u2019d been able to reach. He said I\u2019m sorry.\nHe was very professional. I was impressed.\nAny idea why your brother would come here?\n(Between us, my suspicion is Marty and Jeanine stopped there once upon a romantic time \u2014 with Jackson of course. ) I said no, but Marty was ill, very ill, he wasn\u2019t making a lot of sense.\nSir, there\u2019s something else. In the glove compartment of his vehicle we found an envelope containing $41,276.\nForty-one thousand dollars?\nThat\u2019s right. Everything has been inventoried and impounded. There was no note, nothing to indicate foul play, only his address book and some maps. It looks as though he\u2019s been on the road for quite a while, sleeping in the vehicle. Any idea why he would be driving around with that kind of money?\nIt\u2019s a long story.\nThere was a long silence on the phone. I said nothing.\nFinally the chief brought up Jackson. He said the resident ranger lives year-round in the park with his family. They have three children. The dog was \u201cpretty shook up\u201d but the kids were able to calm him down. He\u2019s very affectionate. The kids are crazy about him \u2014 won\u2019t let him out of their sight. For the time being we decided to keep him here on the premises.\nYou know how kids and dogs are, the chief said. They think it\u2019s some kind of miracle, finding him this way.\nThat\u2019s fine, I said, keep him. Marty would want that. Yes, I do know how kids and dogs are.\nThere\u2019s no collar, the chief said. Do you know his name? Is there anything about the dog we should know?","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

He was round as a hot air balloon but heavy as a walrus, with little flipper feet and pudgy hands flapping out from his sides. He descended upon her from the sky, darkening out the daylight above her, waving his stubby arms and feet as his balloon-body glided earthward, until he alit, square on top of her, and let out a satisfied sigh of relief.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Emiline cried. He sat on her back, squashing her face into the sidewalk. The pavement scratched at her and a pebble dug into her cheek. \u201cGet up, Gustavo!\u201d she wailed. \u201cYou\u2019re crushing me! I can\u2019t breathe!\u201d\nGustavo rolled around on top of her, reveling in the softness of his landing. Emiline dragged her fingernails along the pavement and kicked her feet in the air, but if he knew that he had landed on her, Gustavo did not care.\nEmiline married Gustavo because she loved him like a brother, the brother she had always longed for when she was a girl. She had grown up by herself, an only child to parents who worked at the university laboratory and came home and buried themselves under the papers on their desks, piled as high as haystacks. Emiline would knock on their study door. She could hear the papers rustle.\n\u201cCome in!\u201d her mother would cry. Emiline would peer around the heavy oaken door. She\u2019d see a hand clutching eyeglasses sticking out amid the heap of manuscripts and data tables, or perhaps she would find her father\u2019s shoe, kicked off and thrown across the room.\n\u201cDo I disturb you?\u201d Emiline would ask.\n\u201cOf course not, dear,\u201d her mother would answer. \u201cDid you finish your dinner?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Emiline would lie. She hadn\u2019t finished her dinner. She\u2019d fed it to her imaginary brother and saved the cold bits for herself.\n\u201cHand me my cup of tea, would you, darling?\u201d\nEmiline would push the teacup and saucer closer to the large pile, while her mother\u2019s delicate hand waved blindly.\n\u201cThank you, dear,\u201d said her mother, curling a long finger around the teacup\u2019s ear-shaped grasp.\nEmiline withdrew to bed.\nWhen Emiline met Gustavo, he was the first person who had ever listened to her. He used to tell her, \u201cI want to know everything about you. Are you hot, are you cold? I want to know. Are you frightened? What did you have for breakfast?\u201d\n\u201cI had oatmeal, with almonds and sunflower seeds,\u201d Emiline would tell him.\n\u201cSunflower seeds!\u201d Gustavo would proclaim. \u201cMy sunflower. You shine with a brilliance few women will ever know.\u201d\nThere was more. He liked to brush Emiline\u2019s hair, plucking out the burrs and stickums that had landed there during the day, working out the knots with warm oil. His hands were strong, and sometimes he would stroke his thumbs along the nape of her neck until she felt herself surrender.\nHe had a big walnut bed with a patchwork quilt and flannel sheets, and Emiline liked to burrow herself there, watching the dust motes dance in a strip of morning light that cut through the room and landed in a shiny pool on Emiline\u2019s jacket, which she sometimes dropped on the floor.\nThey had a small wedding in the back room of the courthouse. Gustavo\u2019s large family, whom Emiline had never met before and hadn\u2019t seen since, spilled out into the aisles and jostled each other for the best view of the bride and groom, taking photographs and murmuring with approval to each other as Gustavo and Emiline exchanged vows.\nFor fourteen months, Emiline was content. Gustavo brought her flowers on Friday afternoons, usually posies and snapdragons but sometimes yellow daisies. Emiline made shepherd\u2019s pie and goulash and casseroles that filled both of them up and usually put Gustavo to sleep, head on the table.\nShortly after their first anniversary, though, things began to change. First of all, Gustavo began to grow. Each breath he took sucked up more air. His hands became wider until his wedding ring would not come off, but gripped his finger like a tiny gold vise. When they went out to eat, Gustavo took up almost all of Emiline\u2019s field of vision as she sat opposite him at the table.\nMaybe it was the casseroles, or maybe it was some kind of an illusion, because he only seemed to grow large on certain days of the week. If Emiline looked at him suddenly, turned her head too quickly, he appeared bloated, puffy, his feet even floating a bit above the ground. If she turned her head slowly, and crept a glance at him quietly, there was Gustavo, back to his normal size, polishing the silverware and whistling a small tune.\nNot long thereafter, Emiline began to feel as if she was being followed. Shadows in the alleyways reached out to her on the street, but she never found anyone there.\nOne day, instead of looking over her shoulder, Emiline looked up. And there he was. A dirigible in the sky. She squinted at him, covering her eyes from the bright sun, but she was certain of it. Gustavo floated high above her, coasting along in the summer breeze.\nDay after day, it went on like this. In the grocery store, she\u2019d feel his presence, and catch a glimpse of him hovering outside when she passed the window by the mangoes and kumquats. Gustavo trailed her on her errands, blotting out the sun, and when she stopped and had tea at a caf\u00e9, he shaded her newspaper and cooled the afternoon heat with his overbearing girth.\nSome days, he would swoop down and land on her without warning, his shadow blossoming in size as he tumbled. She would try to run but he came too quickly and he would crush her, pinning her to the sidewalk, scraping her cheeks and giving her bruises on her arms and legs. The mangoes and kumquats would roll into the gutter.\nNo one seemed to notice, though a little dog tied to a post once barked wildly.\nWhen she came home at night, he would be there, back to his normal size, whistling as he chopped the onions and poured the evening wine. She peered at him sideways, still tingling from the scratches and sidewalk burns.\nHe\u2019d hand her a goblet of wine with a smile and a wink. Emiline looked at his hands, smooth and graceful, no longer bloated like water balloons. She drank her wine.\nShe vowed that she would talk to him about it. But every time the moment seemed right, she would open her mouth, timidly, fish-like, and before she could speak, Gustavo would take up all the air. \u201cYou\u2019re my idol, baby,\u201d he would say. \u201cHave I ever told you that? Every man on the street is jealous because I\u2019m walking next to such a fine young thing. I dig that, Emiline. I dig you, and I dig that.\u201d\nGustavo stabbed radicchio and arugula drenched in olive oil and stuffed it in his mouth, salad dressing running down his chin in a rivulet that forked into a Y and then dripped onto the tablecloth.\nEmiline\u2019s fish mouth closed. Opened. Closed.\nNighttimes were the worst. She would dream of her parents, now long dead, and her imaginary brother, long dead, too. How terribly she missed them. Emiline didn\u2019t want Gustavo\u2019s posies, or his snapdragons. She wanted to go home.\nEmiline lay in bed, looking at the ceiling, and listened to Gustavo\u2019s heavy, labored breathing, remnants of the evening\u2019s goulash rattling around in his throat. She knew that in the morning the slice of light would cascade through the split in the curtains, decorating a shimmering wall between the window and the bed. She closed her eyes and looked forward to that.\nGustavo stirred. He clattered his throat and sniffled. He smacked his heavy lips. Emiline kept her eyes closed and imagined the golden wall of light, dancing for her in the morning.\nThe bed creaked and moaned and shifted, and Gustavo rolled his walrus body on top of her. Emiline opened her eyes and turned her head to the window, searching for a sign.\nBut Gustavo raised himself above her, and the moonlight disappeared.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

To ignore the collar stiff on the back of her neck.\nHer legs were cold and she covered herself, pulling the sheets and blanket up to her waist. She breathed deeply, holding the inhalations and exhalations each for counts of five. Focused on relaxing bit by bit each part of her body beginning with her toes.\nShe may not have gotten beyond her knees. She was curled on her right side, the sun through the windows warm on her eyelids when she felt the body slip in next to her.\nHis arm wrapped around her waist in an embrace that seemed familiar, the press of his chest on her back natural, his breath rippling her hair somehow expected.\nTransformation, she thought, unwilling to open her eyes.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Did anyone care that when he fell his legs snapped like carrots and that his blood ran slow like ranch dressing? People were interested \u2014 casually (onlookers) and professionally (la polic\u00eda) \u2014 but care, not a chance.\nThose that knew the dead man were surprised he had not leapt before. He had no one. No one who cared. Sure there were those that were invested, but always for their own self-servicing ends. One of these people was witness to the dead man\u2019s death. But did anyone, did anyone\u2026\nTruth was the dead man had not committed suicide. Nor was it murder per se. It was accidental \u2014 an aggravated accident.\nNo prints or DNA evidence were discovered in the man\u2019s sixth floor apartment, from either the dead man or the presence (person) present as he fell. The reasons were twofold:\n\u2022 the dead man had no fingerprints or DNA, and,\n\u2022 the presence present was covered head-to-toe in cellophane.\nForensics drew dozens of vials of blood, examined yards of skin, drilled into teeth and marrow, but found no trace of identity.\nTenants told police the man\u2019s name was Joakim Summer-Festival. The current building owner said the man had lived there prior to his purchase of the facility (which he acquired after the previous owner and all his documents had been burned in an off-site fire) ten years earlier.\nThe dead man had no documents on his person but in the apartment there were birth certificates for Mr. Summer-Festival and two others: Johnny Crackcorn and Li Xi Li. Unsure, the authorities placed him in the John Doe file and sent the body to the morgue.\nTruth was, all four names (including John Doe) were legal, though not connectable to the decomposing flesh that was the dead man, now lying in a cold drawer at the morgue awaiting (patiently) his incineration.\nThe dead man was four men in one \u2014 and several more, actually.\nHad the dead men\u2019s complex been authored in the late \u201950s, perhaps it would\u2019ve been written that they had been transformed during a nuclear accident.\nDuring the Great Depression each life would\u2019ve been examined within a full novel of its own.\nIf their stories had been laid down ninety years before, it could\u2019ve been said that the men possessed kaleidoscopity.\nThree hundred years previously, they might\u2019ve been said to be blessed by innumerable angels as foretold by a monk from his seclusion.\nBut the man (men) simply existed, barely quantifiable in any era as separate parts of one whole.\nWhat kind of life did this collection lead? Were they a circus performer? Or did they spend hours reading serial crime fiction? Perhaps they spent hours talking to himselves? Did they have problems with alcohol? Maybe only one did, while the others demanded sobriety.\nThis collective of men were rather busy, despite their solitary existence.\nThe group breathed in oxygen and exhaled microwaves \u2014 they were contracted as a cell phone tower.\nThey ate bologna and cheese, later defecating mice which were donated to schools for classroom pets.\nThe rows of eyes watched internet pornography excessively in order to ejaculate independent film scripts.\nIn a boxed garden strung with hydroponics under halogen, multiple gardeners grew cans of minestrone soup, nicotine patches, biodegradable bullets, and peach-flavored condoms.\nImpeccable intentions aside, it was a sad reality that some of these altruistic commodities passed through malicious hands (Regional Directors of Telecommunications, Sous Chefs, Casting Agents, etc.) on their journeys to those in most need.\nThe presence-in-cellophane was also an extension of a capitalistic need-desire seeking a value injection \u2014 i.e., there to steal as much as it could carry.\nThe entity called itself \u201cHyde.\u201d It was a manifestation of simultaneity: It was the already-been, already-always-been, always-will, the present-as, the present-as-not, will-soon-to-be, will-never-be, and what-cannot-be-named contained within a five-foot-six human frame.\nForever kinetic.\nThe cellophane kept all-possibility from spilling out and negating its existence.\n\u201cHyde\u201d was an entity which did not mean harm but had some bills due and could not let its influential stepfather (a judge of sorts) know how much trouble it was actually in.\nThe entity-presence was a castaway yet forever being watched.\n\u201cHyde\u201d had climbed in the collective\u2019s apartment via the fire escape while the men were out stocking up on bologna. A small creature, the presence was able to snoop around without making much noise, although in a short time there was to be a verbal confrontation.\nLong existing on the edge of hunger, \u201cHyde\u201d was quickly drawn to the garden in the living room. The entity-thief plucked a can of minestrone from the nearest plant growing beneath the halogen lights and observed the improbability in its shining, cloudy hand.\nLoosening a layer of cellophane between the shoulder blades, \u201cHyde\u201d created a papoose and filled it with four tin fruits. A fifth can was to be carried out the window with whatever else could fit in its arms.\nOf the many treasures in the apartment, most were too large for the presence to escape with. A number of extravagant souvenirs were too delicate to survive the rough getaway planned. A great bookshelf and several tables stacked high with tomes were also passed over (since books don\u2019t usually fetch money at pawn shops) \u2014 except for one book, lying on a table near the window.\nIt was a book that appeared ancient: the binding was faded leather, around the edges short tassels had formed from usage. The pages smelt from afar like decaying orange peels (always a sign of a well-aged volume).\nOn the cover was a brilliant red opened hand. It was like someone was extending a hand from within the pages of the book to (failingly) halt \u201cHyde.\u201d\nBooks, despite their inability to earn a reasonable sum, appealed to the thief mostly for aesthetic reasons. Those that it had managed to parse frequently left the presence wanting to read on.\nThere was no title. The entity opened the weathered cover and started to flip through the pages to see if the book was important \u2014 or if it would perhaps speak to some intangible mystery that the presence had once wondered about.\nBut the contents were mostly unintelligible. Sentences went on for pages without any verbs, followed by pages without any nouns, interspersed with mystifying voids.\n\u201cHyde\u201d puckered its lips after reading through several pages, terribly vexed.\n\u201cPut our journal down,\u201d came a muttering voice which sounded as if a series of whipping winds were skirting between \u201cHyde\u2019s\u201d legs.\nThe two bodies stared at one another.\nIt was the entity-thief which appeared to be the strange one (as the men could not be viewed by normal vision) \u2014 and \u201cHyde\u201d felt the eyes of the men scanning its frame from head to heel (a feeling it was long used to).\nStill: Being scrutinized by appearance left the presence unconsciously vulnerable, and \u201cHyde\u201d was now doubly susceptible (being now guilty of crime while also judged aesthetically). Meekly, the presence-in-cellophane cowered against the nearest piece of furniture, a table piled high with papers.\nPerhaps on another occasion the men might\u2019ve let \u201cHyde\u201d slink back out the window without reproach, as they knew the cost of doing the manner of business they had entered into with so many less-than-saintly consumers \u2014 but something about instantaneous surrender preternaturally incensed the men.\n\u201cThief!\u201d\n\u201cW\u2014wait \u2026 I\u2019ll give you back the soup, just let me leave. I don\u2019t want no trouble.\u201d\n\u201cYou know what? You can have that soup. In fact, here\u2019s some more.\u201d And the men started heaving minestrone fresh off the vine.\nBecause of the cellophane, however, \u201cHyde\u201d had very soft hands, like two catcher\u2019s mitts, and the cans did no damage. The men stopped after the third container of beans, assorted veggies, and condensed broth crossed the room without causing any harm to the intruder.\n\u201cThat was impressive.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014I used to play wallball by myself for hours every day when I was younger. It was all I ever did, really.\u201d\n\u201cOur pastime was always writing. Little stories about how the day should\u2019ve gone or how we would\u2019ve liked it to go. Sketches of people we observe from the windows. Most of these books here are journals filled with whatever we felt needed to be written down on that particular day. A lot of it is nonsense, but at the time it seemed relevant\u2014important, almost.\u201d\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what this book is about, then? I couldn\u2019t understand any of it.\u201d\n\u201cThat one\u2019s our latest journal. Our most private thoughts yet. We are truly coming upon some grand realizations about how and why we exist.\u201d\n\u201cSounds great, but how can anybody read any of it? It\u2019s just a jumble of words \u2026\u201d\n\u201cHow much did you read?\u201d\n\u201cNot much. It\u2019s not like I could make anything out of\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNot much! \u2018Not much\u2019 is too much! Trying to steal from us is one thing, but \u2014 our journal \u2014 that\u2019s too far!\u201d\nThe men spun around and grabbed a table leg from a pile of spare parts that had accumulated in the apartment. Brandishing the leg, the men approached \u201cHyde,\u201d grunting. But only a few feet away, they stopped.\n\u201cWe just realized that threatening you won\u2019t do much good. With all that plastic on you, you probably could withstand a ten story drop.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe. Probably not more than six floors though. There was this one time when I was trying to run away from my old boss, he had accused me of stealing some outrageous amount of money, and I had to leap out a window into a dumpster. It didn\u2019t hurt at all, just a lot of vibration, but I was fine.\u201d\n\u201cSo this isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve tried to steal from someone, huh? Just like you were trying to steal soup from us, you son of a bitch!\u201d\nThis time \u201cHyde\u201d lunged for the window, but on the table where the book lay was an ornamental cactus on which the entity-presence-thief caught itself on a spine just above the hip that opened a slight tear in the cellophane.\nCausing a spire of will-never-be to flare out with mutant velocity.\nLaunching the men out the open window onto the concrete below.\nPart II: The Veil\nAlthough \u201cHyde\u201d had no memory of its earliest days, the presence had from moments after its birth been dangerously close to splicing itself into untenable pieces.\nWrapped in hospital swaddling blankets, the entity began to show its unfortunate stigma of instability. Its mother shouted at nurses and doctors from the adjustable bed as she witnessed her child\u2019s uncovered face bubble and toil under its skin, flaring close to eruption numerous times.\nFrom then on, \u201cHyde\u201d was to see the world through fettered means.\nOne of the presence\u2019s first memories, while peering through a flannel bandana, was the look on its mother\u2019s eyes as she mentally assembled the virtues of cellophane (especially the promise that the polymer could lock in freshness).\nThe constraints which kept the presence alive had, of course, numerous side effects, most evidently contributing to \u201cHyde\u2019s\u201d short stature \u2014 which had subsequently allowed it to become a decent criminal.\nMore lingering than its height, however, was the disconnection the entity was to have with the world.\nEven though \u201cHyde\u2019s\u201d mother tried to compensate for the considerable barrier (between her child and its worldly interaction) with tender and frequent hugs, it gradually accepted a permanent feeling of separation from other beings.\nAlways looking through fibers (even those as narrow as those which construct the layers of plastic holding itself together) at its mother\u2019s face, at the pages of schoolbooks, at its bank account figures on an ATM screen, at the men, \u201cHyde\u201d was never able to encounter things as they truly were \u2014 or could be.\nUnfortunately, the most unkind fallout from its failed attempt at stealing a few cans of food was that the specific will-never-be that killed the men was that the collective and the entity-presence could\u2019ve been great friends.\nWhat never-could\u2019ve-been were hours of laughter-filled conversation, as both were exceedingly lonely \u2014 and lonely individuals have the most fulfilling conversations upon the mutual recognition of pathos in one another\u2019s eyes.\nThey might\u2019ve become lovers just to feel the soft, smoldering force of another\u2019s body wrapped in one\u2019s own embrace.\nIt would\u2019ve been convenient as well, given that \u201cHyde\u201d was wrapped in prophylactic-like material.\nBut the innumerable probabilities of the men and the entity-presence\u2019s shared-life-that-was-never-to-be all ended when the men hit the concrete.\nVanquished could\u2019ve been the uncertainty of their daily search for but one kind heart to empathize but not pity.\nGone was the refuge of the way-too-late phone call after the threshold of melancholy is breeched.\nGallons of whiskey (Irish \u2014 which both treasured) slung back were never to be consumed, never to be fermented, never to be distilled.\nNow neither could be allowed to forget ever feeling foolish after attempting to press one\u2019s lips to or copulate with a daydream phantom whilst napping midday on the couch.\nThe resulting consequence from the will-never-be meant that a moment \u2014 when the two bodies could have finally ceased the brutality of slicing at one\u2019s self internally with memories of better times and missed opportunities \u2014 had disappeared forever.\nForensics closed the investigation weeks later, unable to resolve the negative test results, unable to determine an identity. After saving some blood, tissue samples, the jawbone, and taking several ubiquitously grainy photos, they put the dead men in the incinerator.\nThe ashes were to be disposed of the following morning with the rest of the medical waste, but before that could happen, the entity-presence snuck into the police complex and stole them.\n\u201cHyde,\u201d too, had been launched out a window, but had survived with only a bruised backside as evidence to its involvement in the accident.\nFurther leakage from the wound was averted as the heat generated from the fissure had resealed the cellophane.\nThe entity-presence managed to slip away before the police arrived, sequestering itself thereafter in its own apartment for days afterward, afraid to go out, afraid of the power that it possessed, afraid of the judicial consequences, afraid of \u2014 afraid of \u2014\nRapt with despair was \u201cHyde\u201d following the men\u2019s demise, but when it heard of the forthcoming disposal, the presence felt obligated and optimistic enough to forward reparation by spreading the remains in a scenic locale.\nEven though \u201cHyde\u201d did not know the collective, it understood that even average men deserve more than a garish lawn ornament to remember their existence.\nBecause what is a tombstone, really? Dates, full name, maybe a few words in memorium \u2014 that is all that remains for some as proof to their years on this earth: no conflict, no flesh, no laughter, no tears, no sense of purpose \u2014 just chisel marks in polished rock.\nDead souls never leave their lots, as stone angels cannot fly.\n\u201cHyde\u201d had once pondered if beings are only granted a certain, limited number of words to express themselves before they are caused to expire.\nEven though the presence (by nature of its appearance) did not speak with others very often, it was always chose its words carefully, afraid that stammering might lead to an early death.\nNow, again, \u201cHyde\u201d had taken up this thought, hoping that it had not caused the men to vanish from this planet before they got to the most important things to say.\nOf course, the presence, being unaware of the men\u2019s collective existence, if its supposition were true, could not fathom the exponential figure of words its victim(s) might\u2019ve had at their disposal.\nSo involved in this worry was the presence that it did not fully grasp that it was speaking its thoughts simultaneously as they crossed the greyness between the sealed space of its head.\nThe entity-in-cellophane carried the ashes to a poppy hill on the inland side of the Pacific.\nThe sun and the breeze oscillated warm and cool on \u201cHyde\u2019s\u201d brow.\nWhile chanting solemnly words recollected during its days working for its most notorious employer (words which were said to grant the deceased access to superstitions known only on the other side of living), \u201cHyde\u201d scattered the remains of the dead men.\nWatching the ashes float from its hands, the presence added sighs as it thought about how handsome the men was (were), about how a two-day beard might\u2019ve sounded when dragged across its neck, about the kisses never swapped, about long looks for no other reason than to remind one\u2019s self of how lucky it was, about liberated passion long overdue for release finally allowed to spill bliss into every capillary, and about how it was all its own responsibility.\n\u201cHyde\u201d was not careful, therefore, to avoid depositing ash inside the blossoms.\nWhen noticing its carelessness, the entity bent over, plucked a flower, and tried to fan the remains from the exposed crocus. The entity-presence fanned harder and harder, unable to remove the men from the flower\u2019s innards, until suddenly the blossom leapt from its hand and took flight with miniature ochre wings, circumspectrally rising off and out of vision.\nAs the blossom ascended, words tumbled from it like acorns dropping off an antiquarian oak during the first great storm of spring, landing upon and around \u201cHyde\u201d with dense, striking thumps.\nBut it was only words that fell \u2014 there was no force behind them to be voiced.\nAnd a voice cannot be heard if there is not muscle to push breath out a mouth which wishes to speak.\nNevertheless, it was a marvelous sight: the (seemingly) what-never-could\u2019ve-been becoming the present-as-already-always-just-happened.\nThe presence might\u2019ve mused at length about what a poppy-blossom bird ate, where it nested, or what its mate looked like (mallards and blue jays are negatively paired, for instance).\nBut before wonder could consume the entity, an incalculable sacrifice \u2014 a deed allowing nature to flourish beyond its limitations \u2014 was conceived of within the cellophane and acted upon without pause.\n\u201cHyde\u201d clasped at its exoskeleton along the temples, pulling the polymer vigorously apart, screaming with ravenous exertion. Its thought dedicated solely to the task.\nThe cellophane stretched and strained until reaching the edges of the presence\u2019s arms.\nThen it ruptured and the presence raptured.\nThe resulting sonorous percussion sheared the whole of the hill \u2014 and every blossom took flight with silken orange wings into a sky so clear and deeply blue that one could almost detect the expanse of outer space, its dark void pushing that rich, azure hue closer to Earth.\nWith this noble fissuring, the blossoms finally had force behind the words for them to now speak. From high altitudes what was said could not be discerned by human ears.\nBut across the valley, the flutter of murmuring voices drew thousands of eyes to these daylight stars of rising poppy-blossoms climbing to meet divinity and supplant its place among the skies.\nFrom the foot of the hills, however, the words bade forgiveness to \u201cHyde\u201d for its attempted crime, to business associates fueled by avarice, to the men\u2019s neighbors who had neglected a solitary heart(s).\nForgiveness was given to all, whether they deserved it or not.\nJames Hirtz is a graduate of Kent State University and the University of Akron.

He selects his longest boning knife, the one he uses for jointing bears.\nHe cuts the heart from the maid\u2019s bosom. It bleats like an infant baboon. He bears the heart home. The Queen laughs. Her Magic Mirror sings a song about a whale.\nThe shocked and wounded Snow White stumbles through briars. The maw in her chest sucks and sobs. Small birds flee.\nSnow White comes to a hut. The hut is crude. It leans. The doorway hasn\u2019t a door.\nSmall men live within, unwashed and hideous. Their beards have never been cut, their nails never trimmed. They can\u2019t speak. They don\u2019t bar the mutilated princess from their ranks. Are they aware of her presence? Who can tell?\nSnow White sways. Her chest-hole sputters. Green drops spatter the wall.\nSnow White names the men. You are Dumpo, she says. You are Fungus, and you must be Scabby. I call thee Gob, and thee Mush Mouth, thee Tormenter-Of-Shrews, thee Microcephalus, and thee Flatus. And you (eyes milky with cataracts) must be Blind John.\nSo begins a strange domestic arrangement. Snow White eats the small mens\u2019 food, elbowing her way among the grunting homunculi. Every meal the same. Berries, roadkill, pinecones inexpertly scorched.\nSnow White offers the small men her broken body. She lifts her skirt, gestures at her mottled skin. The men fail to comprehend. One finds a roach crawling in the dirt. He eats it. Another shits in the umbrella stand.\nThe hut is dark, the windows crusted over, the floor a morass of shrew-bones and filth.\nIn the castle, the Magic Mirror shows a wrestling match. The Queen is away and searching.\nHow now, magic of the winter sun? the Queen inquires. Shall I poison fruit for this helium-voiced slattern? The winter sun replies: all fruit is poison. Eat and die, eat and die, has it ever been different?\nHow now, magic of slow Time? Can you assist me with a disguise? A crone, bent like the thorn-tree in autumn?

So she goes.\n\u201cDon\u2019t linger,\u201d her mother says. \u201cDon\u2019t wear your hood in a revealing way. Don\u2019t smell like flesh. Don\u2019t sweat, seep, waft, secrete, or stand downwind. Else you are asking for wolves.\u201d\nHood enters the forest on the eastern side. When she exits the western side, her hood is torn.

The loudspeakers squawk in binary code. Gretel und Hansel must relocate.\nHansel und Gretel venture through the forest. There are no trees, only identical metal poles. Skeletal birds have eaten the nails that Hansel dropped. The compass won\u2019t work; the Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses, the needle spins demented through the points.\nAhead sits a wigwam fashioned of rusty oil drums.\nThe wigwam is inhabited by an Intelligent Designer.

The Moon assumes a square orbit, the seas turn to brake fluid. Gretel must think of something quickly.\nThe Intelligent Designer will soon inflate Hansel to the size of the observable universe. She commands Gretel to destroy one of Euclid\u2019s Five Axioms, preferably the one with angles. Gretel asks the Intelligent Designer to consider the platypus, but backwards. Paley\u2019s Watch stops ticking. The Designer vanishes in a puff of lateral thinking.\nHansel becomes a refracted consciousness, and emerges from his tomb.

The white towers were tall and thin, with minaret tops. Just like the snow asparagus FourMother cloned in the agrovat, Lewis thought. Funny he\u2019d never noticed the resemblance before.\nTurning from the window, Lewis moved to the low table beside the bed, where Montgomery hunched with a tiny mixing spatula over jars of colored powders. He leaned over his friend\u2019s shoulder as Montgomery spooned the last of the mixture into a vial, added two tablespoons of water, and shook.\n\u201cBingo,\u201d Montgomery said as peered at the settling bubbles.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll never work,\u201d Lewis said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d He set the vial of green liquid in a stainless steel rack and handed Lewis a scalpel. \u201cReady?\u201d\n\u201cReady.\u201d\nMontgomery rolled up his sleeve and placed his elbow on the tabletop with a steel tray under his forearm. He held a clear vacuum tube ready in his other hand.\n\u201cNow.\u201d\nLewis laid the scalpel edge along the soft inside of his friend\u2019s forearm and slashed. The wound sealed itself almost instantly.\n\u201cYou have to cut deeper,\u201d Montgomery said.\nOn the third try the cut showed bone and Montgomery was able to insert the vacuum tube before his nanobots could reconstitute the damaged tissues. Sensing the presence of a foreign body, the enhanced macrophages in his blood attacked, devouring four millimeters of the tube before he could extract it. He managed to transfer a half teaspoon of blood to the mixing plate, where it boiled savagely in an effort to destroy itself. Lewis applied several drops of the green liquid and the bubbling stopped.\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Montgomery.\n\u201cLet me try.\u201d\n\u201cYou know it won\u2019t work.\u201d\n\u201cIt was my idea.\u201d\nThey repeated the experiment, but Lewis\u2019s blood simmered on the plate, assimilating the tincture before devouring itself and leaving the metal spotless.\nAt this moment the bedroom door hissed open and Montgomery\u2019s younger brother Walter burst in.\n\u201cMonty, Monty!\u201d he hollered, though Montgomery was barely two meters away. \u201cI finished my Virgil translation! Want to hear?\u201d\nLewis spun on the child and snarled. \u201cDamn it, Widget, can\u2019t you see we\u2019re busy?\u201d\nMontgomery lifted a hand. \u201cI said don\u2019t call him that.\u201d Turning to the child, he said, \u201cWalter, do you remember our agreement?\u201d\nWalter pouted. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Would you like to try again?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nThe child left the room, waving a hand across the door\u2019s wall sensor.\n\u201cYou\u2019re in a generous mood tonight,\u201d Lewis said.\n\u201cLay off. He\u2019s only seventy.\u201d\n\u201cSeventy and a half,\u201d said Lewis mockingly.\nThe door chimed.\n\u201cEnter,\u201d said Montgomery, and Walter stepped back into the room.\n\u201cNow would you like to hear the Virgil?\u201d\nMontgomery set down the tiny stainless steel mixing paddle and leaned back in his chair. \u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d he said.\n\u201cQuid noster vadis hocnum,\u201d Walter began. \u201cSeptis inculum questis\u2026\u201d\nLewis folded his arms and spent the duration of the performance glaring into a corner of the ceiling. He and Montgomery had completed the required translations too, all fourteen thousand pages, during their P levels. Lewis had been voted third best translator in his generation. They had given him a prize. That was four hundred years ago, but he still remembered every word of it well enough to snort at Walter\u2019s occasional error.\nBut Montgomery listened rapt and beaming. Yes, the translation was imperfect, but his brother wasn\u2019t even through his M levels yet. It had taken him only seven years to finish it, less than half the average time. And for his N\u2019s, at the request of his professor, Walter would translate the works of Virgil into Sanskrit.\n\u201cBravo, bravo!\u201d said Montgomery, clapping as the performance finished.\nWalter wrinkled his nose. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, but I still like the Hindus better. Hey, what are you making?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s an experiment,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cDon\u2019t touch.\u201d\n\u201cEnergized tincture of carbon,\u201d said Walter, identifying one vial by its particular rusty hue. \u201cPotassium cilicate, hydrogen carbonate.\u201d He examined the mixture on the plate, deducing the proportions of its contents. He made a quick mental calculation and wrinkled his nose. \u201cMeat tenderizer?\u201d\nMontgomery laughed. \u201cNot exactly. But close.\u201d\n\u201cThen what?\u201d\nLewis, who was sitting on the bed, sighed explosively and fell backwards onto the pillows.\n\u201cWidget \u2014 sorry, Walter \u2014 aren\u2019t you supposed to be deriving the differential calculi or something?\u201d\n\u201cI finished,\u201d Walter said. \u201cA cleaning agent?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not exactly that, either,\u201d said Montgomery.\nLewis sat up again. \u201cCould we just get on with it, please?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your hurry?\u201d said Montgomery. \u201cAnyway, it\u2019s my experiment.\u201d\n\u201cWhat experiment?\u201d said Walter.\nLewis hopped to his feet. \u201cYour experiment? It was my idea.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m the subject.\u201d\n\u201cMonty,\u201d said Walter, tugging at his brother\u2019s sleeve. \u201cWhat experiment?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m the one publishing it,\u201d Lewis said.\n\u201cPublishing. Exactly what are you publishing, Lewis?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m publishing the study. The\u2026 the data.\u201d\n\u201cThe data,\u201d Montgomery repeated.\n\u201cWhat data?\u201d said Walter.\nLewis waved the child off and strode to the window. Montgomery rose from the chair and followed.\n\u201cYes, Lewis,\u201d said Montgomery. \u201cWhat data? Temperature drop? Weight loss? Putrefaction?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Lewis burst. \u201cWhatever \u2014 whatever happens.\u201d\n\u201cMonty?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get to know what happens,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cI\u2019m the one. I\u2019m the one who gets to know. You just get to watch.\u201d\nIt was night now, and the white towers gleamed in the darkness. Lewis went to the window and stood with his fists behind his back.\n\u201cAnd I can wait a hundred years if I want. And in a hundred years, Walter will be old enough to publish. And then it can be his experiment.\u201d\n\u201cMonty?\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d said Lewis, not turning from the window. \u201cHe can stay.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Montgomery. \u201cThat\u2019s nice of you.\u201d He returned to his chair and laced his fingers over his knee again. \u201cWalter? Do you have a question?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is your question?\u201d\n\u201cWhat experiment?\u201d\n\u201cWe are conducting an experiment in a form of altered consciousness.\u201d\nWalter peered skeptically at the red mixture. \u201cIs that a precursor to ergotamine?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cA tetrahydrocannabinoid?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cA mescalate?\u201d\nNo, Montgomery explained. Those were psychoactive compounds, and this was something different. This one wasn\u2019t technically psychoactive, because it didn\u2019t act on the brain. At least, not directly. The way the compound acted was. .. did Walter remember when Montgomery fell down the stairs, and got a purple spot on his arm, and SixMother had to take Montgomery to a scientist, because nobody could identify it?\n\u201cI remember the purple spot,\u201d said Walter. \u201cYour bz \u2013 bzorze.\u201d\n\u201cBruise,\u201d Montgomery corrected.\nAnd the compound did something like that, but a whole-body effect. There was very little data on the phenomenon, and even that was very old, and unreliable. And what they were going to find out was \u2026 well \u2026 did Walter know how old Montgomery was? That\u2019s right: eight hundred and forty years old. And how old was Walter? Seventy and a half, of course. And Mother? Six thousand and eight. And TwoMother was nine thousand, and so on, up to SixMother, who was in her twenty-five thousands. And how old did Walter suppose Virgil was?\nWalter blinked twice, then said, \u201cThirty thousand, four hundred and sixty-eight.\u201d\nAt the window, Lewis scoffed and turned to face them. \u201cFour hundred and sixty-seven,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSixty-eight,\u201d said Walter.\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Lewis said, \u201cbut I should know. My great-great-great-great-great grandmother translated the original codex.\u201d\nWalter looked at his brother. \u201cGreat-great-great-great-great grand?\u201d\n\u201cHe means his SevenMother,\u201d Montgomery said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Lewis, advancing. \u201cMy SevenMother. And where is she now?\u201d\nWalter took a step back.\n\u201cIn her room?\u201d\n\u201cWrong,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cGuess again.\u201d\n\u201cIn the cafeteria?\u201d\n\u201cWrong again,\u201d said Lewis.\n\u201cLay off,\u201d said Montgomery.\n\u201cWhat do you care?\u201d said Lewis. \u201cYou\u2019re the one with the defect. You get to know. I\u2019ll never know.\u201d\n\u201cKnow what?\u201d said Walter.\n\u201cHa!\u201d A fleck of spittle flew from Lewis\u2019s lip. \u201cKnow what! What not know?\u201d\nBefore Montgomery could act, Lewis had seized the child\u2019s arm and dragged him to the window. \u201cThere,\u201d he said, pointing. \u201cWhat are the specifications of that tower?\u201d\n\u201cW-Winchester family residence,\u201d Walter stuttered. \u201cHeight, one thousand, six hundred and seventy three meters; circumference three hundred\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSuper,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cGreat. And that one?\n\u201cPaloma family residence,\u201d said Walter. \u201cHeight one thousand\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cYou know them all, right? Of course you do, all four million. And in your Q2\u2019s you\u2019ll learn the building systems and subsystems and the genealogies of every person on the planet. Look: See that star?\u201d\n\u201cArcturus.\u201d\n\u201cI can calculate its mass to within four grams.\u201d\n\u201cMonty,\u201d said Walter, \u201cwill I learn the masses of the stars?\u201d\nMontgomery was laying on the bed now, staring at the ceiling. \u201cYes,\u201d he said dreamily. \u201cIn your Q17\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cI can name them,\u201d said Walter.\n\u201cSure you can,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cAnd one day you\u2019ll know the names to everything. But where is my great \u2014 my SevenMother?\u201d\n\u201cWould you like me to query the locator?\u201d\nLewis laughed bitterly. \u201cThe locator doesn\u2019t have access to that data.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cBecause she\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\u201cThen we\u2019ll query the remote locators, too.\u201d\n\u201cIt won\u2019t work.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it won\u2019t,\u201d Lewis said. He stared out the window for a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s like this: where do you suppose Virgil is?\u201d\n\u201cIn his room?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Virgil is gone. Go ahead, query the locators. Query them all.\u201d\nWalter thought for a moment, but didn\u2019t submit the query. \u201cIs that what your experiment is? To find your SevenMother?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than that.\u201d\n\u201cBut for valid data you need thousands of subjects. Not just Monty.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cIt\u2019ll only work on Monty.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause he has the defect. A recessive gene, plus a vulnerability in one of his macrophages. Anyone else, their nanos would just gobble it up.\u201d\nWalter creased his brow, calculating. \u201cThat\u2019s improbable,\u201d he said. \u201cMonty, is it true? Monty?\u201d He went to the bed and shook his brother\u2019s foot. \u201cMonty?\u201d He climbed onto the bed. \u201cLook, Lewis,\u201d he said. \u201cMonty\u2019s asleep.\u201d\nLewis came over. Montgomery\u2019s lips were covered bubbles of white spit.\n\u201cMonty?\u201d said Walter. \u201cMonty? Monty? Monty? Lewis, why won\u2019t he wake up?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not asleep,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cHe\u2019s with Virgil.\u201d","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Reaching between her bumped-up knees, she draws a rose on the blacktop, using a piece of chalk she swiped.\nIt\u2019s awkward, making space between her big feet, in her 14-year-old brother\u2019s old Timberland boots. At least now she\u2019s sitting. When she walks, the boots make her feel more clumsy than usual. According to her classmate Steph, those boots are two sizes too big and half as ugly as Ellyn.\nShe rolls the chalk on its side to shade the underside of a sawtooth leaf and smiles to herself. The leaf looks almost three dimensional. She\u2019s about to apply the technique to her rose\u2019s petals, when a shadow darkens her drawing. She stops shading but doesn\u2019t dare look up.\nNervous sweat collects in Ellyn\u2019s armpits, under her too-soon breasts, and between her rolls of stomach fat \u2014 the kind of sweat that smells bad, ever since she started getting her period.\n\u201cSeriously,\u201d Steph says.\nEllyn knows her smell has drifted up to Steph\u2019s perky nose. She peeks, but Steph\u2019s eyes are not piercing Ellyn\u2019s the way they do when she teases her.\nInstead, Steph gazes at the rose as her lips fall into a soft smile. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201d\nThis is something art can do, Ellyn thinks. The art teacher, Mr. Parisi, has told her as much. A drawing is an expression of your true nature and has the power to bring people together.\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Ellyn\u2019s voice cracks. She hasn\u2019t spoken all day, not even at home. Her brother leaves for school an hour before she does, and since her mother\u2019s been gone, her father sleeps in. When they do cross paths, he can barely look at her. She finally figured out why: he thinks it\u2019s Ellyn\u2019s fault that her mother killed herself. He\u2019s probably right.\nEllyn\u2019s face gets hot. Too afraid to see Steph\u2019s reaction, she keeps her eyes on her drawing.\nBut then Steph squats beside her. \u201cCan you show me how?\u201d\nEllyn hesitates a few seconds, then sits up straighter.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\nShifting over to make room for Steph, she demonstrates rubbing the side of the chalk onto a petal. Then she uses her fingers to spread the dust into thinner coverage to create the illusion of light.\n\u201cHere, you try,\u201d she says, holding out the chalk.\nSteph shades another petal.\n\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Ellyn mimics Mr. Parisi\u2019s encouraging tone. \u201cNow blend it like this.\u201d She places her hand gently over Steph\u2019s to guide her.\nSteph jerks her hand away and twists her lips into a snarl of disgust.\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch me. You stink.\u201d She throws down the chalk and runs off shrieking, \u201cShe touched me! Gross! I need a cootie-shot, quick!\u201d\nEllyn\u2019s eyes burn, but she promises herself she won\u2019t cry. She won\u2019t look up to see Steph collapse into the circle of friends surely waiting for her, won\u2019t listen to their squeals. Why had she touched her? Stupid, so stupid!\nEllyn folds in on herself. She tucks her elbows between her bent knees and bows her head, wanting to disappear. Inches away is the chalk, shattered on the pavement.\nWith her boots\u2019 thick soles, she grinds the bits of white into dust and obliterates her rose.\nWaiting until the warning bell rings before getting up doesn\u2019t help. A cluster of Steph\u2019s friends linger at the door. As she passes among them, she suffers what seems like an eternity of taunting moos. Blocking the entrance is Steph. She clutches her stomach and doubles over, faking an exaggerated series of gags.\nEllyn tries to bolt back to the playground, but the kids close in on her. The clanging bell and the crackling PA drift away, distorted, as if in some distant echo chamber, but the children\u2019s voices and Steph\u2019s retching ring clear.\nEllyn covers her ears, yet louder and louder it all sounds. She begins to shake. The shaking becomes violent, and the other children laugh.\n\u201cLook, she\u2019s going crazy!\u201d someone shouts.\nStop, she thinks. Stop!\nBut she\u2019s caught in their circle, spinning, spinning, and there\u2019s no way out. She closes her eyes against her tears, the sun paints a trail of red spots behind her eyelids, she\u2019s lost, dizzy inside the whirl of shouting and retching until she finally screams, \u201cSTOP!\u201d\nThe playground goes quiet. Ellyn drops her hands and opens her eyes.\nSteph\u2019s friends stand around her, frozen, their faces contorted by their cruelty. She\u2019s afraid to breathe, but of course she must.\nNothing changes.\nShe coughs once, twice, and the still life before her remains. Beyond the children, just inside the door, stands their teacher, Mrs. LeVine, clipboard in hand to check them in, unaware of the bullying, as usual. No motion from her either. It seems the entire world has gone still. Not even the sound of a bird breaks the silence.\nAn unusual feeling drops over Ellyn, from her head to her toes. All her muscles relax. She stands taller. She takes a deep breath, and she knows what it is: relief. At last, no torment from outside, no hatred from within.\nShe walks among the other kids, pokes a tentative finger into Justin\u2019s shoulder. Nothing. Bolder, she lifts the corner of Minna\u2019s skirt all the way up until she sees her purple panties.\nEllyn whispers into Minna\u2019s unhearing ear: \u201cPurple is a stupid color for underwear.\u201d\nNo reaction.\nShe does it again, screaming at the top of her lungs this time, then bursts out laughing, the way the others do after shouting something awful at her. It doesn\u2019t feel as good as she always figured it must, since they do it all the time, but it definitely feels better to be the one shouting.\nNow she stands before Steph. The girl\u2019s frozen form is upright; she\u2019s prepared to throw herself forward into vomiting position. Ellyn peers into her wide-open mouth, at those straight white teeth.\n\u201cYour breath stinks,\u201d she says softly.\nAs she stares, she senses the pulse of blood through Steph\u2019s soft, pink mouth flesh. She feels the life deep inside her and thinks she hears the secret thrum of the girl\u2019s heart. Tentatively, Ellyn touches her fingers to Steph\u2019s lips. She pushes them into her mouth and across her slick tongue.\nThen, without understanding why or how, she snakes her hand down Steph\u2019s throat.\nTeeth dig into her elbow. Ellyn moves her hand around, feeling the spongy warmth of Steph\u2019s lungs, surprised at how easily the tissue gives way. When her fingertips touch something firm and stirring, she clutches it and rips it out.\nSunlight glistens on Steph\u2019s heart as it beats in Ellyn\u2019s hand. With each pulse, blood oozes from shredded arteries and veins, painting her wrist crimson. Its life slows, then stops, and Ellyn\u2019s eyes go wide. She wonders, for a moment, if she should return the heart to its place, but what good would that do, now that all its connections are broken?\nBesides, the warmth of it is comforting, like a baby rabbit nestling against its mother\u2019s body.\nNewfound instinct sends her weaving among the children to the place she last stood. She closes her eyes and shuts away the kids\u2019 menacing postures, her teacher\u2019s ignorance of her suffering. Her pain returns as fury, and she finds herself squeezing the dead heart inside her fist.\nWhen she opens her eyes again, the world around her reanimates. The final bell is ringing, and Steph finishes her forward lurch and releases a resounding retch. Mrs. LeVine tilts her head toward the sound, then goes back to her clipboard.\n\u201cMove, cow,\u201d Steph says as she falls in line behind Ellyn.\nEllyn half turns and studies Steph for damage, but she\u2019s the same mean girl she\u2019s always been.\nAs they walk into the building, Ellyn opens her hand \u2014 no blood.\nInstead, a tiny, heart-shaped charm sits on her chalk-dusted palm. It feels heavy for its size. Hot. Its silvery sheen glimmers under the fluorescent lights. She glances back at Steph, who walks as surely as the rest. Ellyn tucks the charm into her pocket.\nThe next morning, Steph doesn\u2019t line up behind Ellyn. Two of her best friends are absent as well. There\u2019s a buzz of gossip going around the room, which isn\u2019t shared with Ellyn, as the kids take their seats. Mrs. LeVine quiets the class.\n\u201cChildren,\u201d she says, her voice unsteady, \u201cI have sad news.\u201d Wringing her hands, she continues. \u201cStephanie Kaden is \u2014 she died last night. A burst appendix.\u201d\nLike Mrs. LeVine, some of the girls are crying. Even Justin has tears in his eyes.\n\u201cMr. Philips, the school psychologist, will\u2014\u201d\nEllyn doesn\u2019t hear the rest. As she fingers the mysterious charm in her pocket, her own heart is drumming in her ears.\nAt two o\u2019clock on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving break, Mrs. LeVine tells the class, \u201cI need to meet with Principal Agliori. You may all draw on the blackboard while I\u2019m gone.\u201d\nDraw on the board! Ellyn\u2019s pulse quickens.\nThe teacher shows red lipstick-stained teeth with her version of a smile. \u201cI trust you\u2019ll behave.\u201d\nEllyn is out of her seat before the door closes behind Mrs. LeVine. She endures the teasing as she clumps to the front of the room to snatch two pieces of chalk \u2014 blue and white. Engrossed in outlining a soaring blue jay, she doesn\u2019t at first notice Justin snickering.\n\u201cMoo,\u201d he whispers.\nBeside her beautiful bird, he\u2019s made a pathetic attempt at drawing a cow with wings \u2014 a mockery of both her and her drawing. He writes \u201cEllyn Moo-ller\u201d beneath it.\nEllyn picks up an eraser and wipes his handiwork away, then returns to her bird.\nJustin starts another picture, and Ellyn erases that one too. He moves to another spot and begins again. She follows him like that, erasing as soon as he draws, until she hears him whisper to the kids nearby, \u201cEverybody do it. It\u2019s driving her crazy.\u201d\nShe gives up. All of them are drawing flying Ellyn Moo-ller cows.\nIgnore them, she tells herself. She concentrates on her jay\u2019s wings as the whispers turn into laughter. When Justin lets out an extended Mooo-ooo, Ellyn backs away from the board.\nAmy catches Ellyn\u2019s eye before scribbling all over the blue jay.\nEllyn\u2019s lower lip trembles.\n\u201cShe\u2019s crying,\u201d Justin says, his brow furrowed.\nHe feels sorry about starting this whole thing, Ellyn thinks. But he shoves Amy out of the way, so he can smear the bird with his bare hands.\n\u201cOuch, Justin! You\u2019re so mean,\u201d Amy laughs.\nEllyn begins to shake.\nJustin releases his loudest moo yet.\n\u201cStop,\u201d Ellyn says, but he doesn\u2019t. None of them do. She closes her eyes and screams, \u201cSTOP!\u201d\nIt\u2019s more difficult to push her hand into Justin\u2019s moo-shaped mouth, but Ellyn manages. As she walks home, she plays her fingers over two charms in her pocket, enjoying the sense of relief a bit longer this time.\nWhen school resumes the Monday after Thanksgiving, everyone knows that Justin and his family died in a plane crash. It was all over the news. Mr. Philips visits the class again, taking time to speak to each student privately. When he tells Ellyn that her silence comes from grief, she pretends to believe him with a solemn nod.\nIt\u2019s a bleak December afternoon, and Mrs. LeVine drones through a math lesson. For the tenth time, Ellyn glances at the clock. Nine minutes until they go to art.\nFinally, Mrs. LeVine erases the equations on the board.\n\u201cMr. Parisi had to leave early today,\u201d she says.\nEllyn\u2019s mood tumbles until her teacher adds, \u201cBut there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t be creative on our own.\u201d\nSoon, each child is set up with paints and brushes, a large sheet of paper, and a cup of water.\nSavoring the round, nutty scent of fresh tempera, Ellyn creates a study of her new favorite shape. A rainbow-hued heart dominates the center of the page, and she\u2019s sketched out a neat pattern of smaller ones for the background. She is precise. Starting from the right, so her left hand won\u2019t drag wet paint across the image, she begins to fill them in with periwinkle blue.\n\u201cMoo.\u201d\nEllyn doesn\u2019t look away from her painting, but she knows Minna, who sits in front of her, has turned around in her chair.\n\u201cWhy do you stink so bad, cow?\u201d\nShe fills in another heart, pleased with the light-to-dark blend she\u2019s rendered.\n\u201cAnswer me. Or should I speak cow? Moo-moo-moo moo?\u201d\nEllyn doesn\u2019t care what Minna is saying, only that she is distracting her.\n\u201cShut up,\u201d she murmurs, \u201cyou annoying idiot.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Minna whips her sodden brush in the air above Ellyn\u2019s desk. It leaves an arc of gray-black spatters across her painting.\nEllyn jumps up so quickly, her chair slams into Michael\u2019s desk behind her.\n\u201cWatch it!\u201d he says.\nWhen Mrs. LeVine rushes over, Minna says, \u201cShe called me a name!\u201d\n\u201cI heard it,\u201d says Michael, though Ellyn doubts that\u2019s true.\nMrs. LeVine firms her lips into a straight line and shakes her head at Ellyn. She looks at the clock and gives two light claps. \u201cLet\u2019s put it behind us. Back to our artwork now.\u201d\nMinna narrows her eyes at Ellyn before turning around, and Michael kicks her chair leg, giving her a jolt. Of course, the teacher notices neither.\nEllyn\u2019s chest burns with the injustice of it all. \u201cBut my painting,\u201d she says, slumping into her chair.\nMrs. LeVine finally looks at her work. She glances at Minna\u2019s impassive back, then at the clock. Leaning a hand on Ellyn\u2019s desk, she asks, \u201cWhat happened? Did you have a spill?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I \u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe can fix it.\u201d She blots the spray of dirty water with a paper towel, but the splotches have soaked through. \u201cYou know, I think you can turn these spots into a string of tiny hearts.\u201d She twirls Ellyn\u2019s brush in paint and creates an inexpert heart of bruised blue on the page. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\nEllyn thinks it\u2019s worse than Minna\u2019s mess. She stares at her ruined painting as Mrs. LeVine walks away.\nMinna turns and grins at Ellyn. \u201cYour picture sucks.\u201d Her words are a signal to the rest of the class.\nThe animal sounds and giggles begin. They are as quiet as a vibration. Ellyn barely hears them, but she certainly feels them. When she begins to shake, she hears Minna whisper, \u201cLook, she\u2019s going nuts.\u201d\nThis time, there\u2019s no false start. She covers her ears, shuts her eyes, and screams, \u201cSTOP!\u201d\nBy February, Ellyn carries enough hearts in her pocket to sound a miniature chiming chorus when she jiggles them. Though they appear to be identical, each one resonates with an echo of its previous owner.\nOne is from her brother\u2019s friend who stunk up their house with pot and said, You gotta stop eating so much anyway, fatty, as he devoured her favorite snacks.\nDrug overdose.\nAnother is from the teenager who drove his quiet Prius up behind her as she walked home from school, then leaned on the horn. He howled when she screamed, getting a group of kids on the opposite side of the street to join in. They all followed her for blocks.\nCar accident.\nThey deserved what they got, she would think to herself.\nBut some of the heart charms trouble her. Certainly, the old man at the deli who mistook her for a boy hadn\u2019t meant any harm. After the third time he called her young man, her hand began to tingle, and she longed for that sense of relief. She couldn\u2019t resist shouting STOP.\nShe tried to shake him, ran out into traffic \u2014 the vehicles and the people inside them unmoving. Even the traffic lights refused to change. Ellyn knew there was no way to restart the world unless she held a heart in her hand.\nThat time, she wept.\nAnd perhaps worse: One day she goes through the charms spread out on her bed and realizes there are several she doesn\u2019t remember collecting at all.\nEach one had been a human heart that had pulsed and died in her hand. She senses that they once resided in man or woman, boy or girl, but what had been their crimes? What if some of the hearts belonged to people as innocent as that old man?\nShe holds her murderous hand up to the window and shivers.\nOutside, the wind shifts clouds across the sky, and sunlight shimmers prettily over the charms. Ellyn rests her palms over their warmth, and her distress falls away. She thinks of all her damaged days, a mountain of wrongs. Her mother gone, her father\u2019s neglect, her classmates provoking her. Mrs. LeVine trying to appease by painting an ugly heart.\nA string of hearts.\nShe rummages through her art supply drawer and finds a spool of silky red ribbon. She cuts a generous piece and begins to work. The sun has set by the time Ellyn finishes knotting each heart in place. When her necklace is done, she puts it on, tying a bow at the nape of her neck. She is enveloped in a peace so splendid that she instantly falls into a dreamless sleep.\nEllyn awakens on Valentine\u2019s Day with little of her usual trepidation. As she walks to school, the weight of her string-of-hearts necklace comforts her.\nAnd then a miracle happens. There is no ridicule at morning line-up. During recess, it\u2019s almost as if she\u2019s just another kid at school.\nNot that she has friends. She still seems to repel the others when she passes \u2014 a subtle shift in their positions that keeps them at a constant safe distance. It\u2019s only a few feet, but she may as well be in a different building. Days and weeks pass. There\u2019s an occasional unkindness when bad luck throws her too close to the others, but before the anger swelling in her chest overwhelms her, the perpetrators move away.\nEllyn touches her necklace, feeling bereft. Deep down, she understands that it\u2019s not only because she\u2019s lonely.\nHer hand tingles until she shoves it into her pocket.\nIn September, Ellyn and her classmates join students from six other elementary schools at middle school. The presence of so many more children must have diluted her class\u2019s collective memory. She was last year\u2019s game. Now they are focused on cigarettes and making out behind the bleachers.\nEllyn falls into her art. While she draws and paints, she welcomes a fleeting amnesia that cloaks her pain.\nYet she has not forgotten the miseries of her previous years, and so never forgets to wear her string of hearts \u2014 until the day she does.\nAnd it\u2019s okay. Nothing bad happens. It seems she no longer needs its protective weight around her neck.\nAt home, she tucks the necklace into a box and stows it in the back of her closet. Eventually, she manages to hide both the box and its adjacent memories in the depths of her consciousness.\nStill, she carries them wherever she goes \u2014 to college and after, to the city where she settles as an adult. Her art is her refuge. When, from time to time, her shame, her guilt, her fury threaten to rise to the surface, Ellyn does not hesitate to bury them again beneath layers of paint and clay.\nEllyn sits at the table in their darkened apartment, eyes closed, as per Kevin\u2019s instructions. Embracing her from behind, he breathes warmth onto the back of her neck, and she flushes as she always does when he\u2019s close.\n\u201cHappy Valentine\u2019s Day, Ellyn Mueller,\u201d he whispers in her ear. \u201cYou can open your eyes now.\u201d\nBefore her, the table is set with a red cloth. Candlelight gleams on a pair of flutes already sparkling with champagne. On her plate is a beribboned box, the perfect size for a ring. The thrill she feels finds its way to her fingers, and she has trouble untying the bow. Finally, she lifts the lid.\nInside is not a ring. Sitting on a bed of red velvet is a silver charm in the shape of a heart. Ellyn presses her lips together to hide her disappointment. For the last three of their six years together, she\u2019s waited for Kevin\u2019s proposal.\n\u201cIt\u2019s lovely,\u201d she says, as a familiar worm of self-doubt threads its way inside her.\nTheir relationship is a sham. He\u2019ll leave as soon as he understands the extent of her shortcomings \u2014 her artwork, her personality, all of it a fraud. She swallows the feeling down, as she has done many times.\nYet there is Kevin, gazing at her with that big, dopey grin of his. Irresistible.\nShe smiles back at him and reminds herself that her childhood suffering is behind her; it must be. Kevin deserves her trust.\n\u201cGive it here,\u201d he says, open palm waiting.\n\u201cHey, I just got it. You\u2019re not going to steal it back, are you?\u201d She lets herself laugh, and the release feels like redemption. After all, she\u2019s a grown woman now. Her work is good, and their relationship is close to perfect. What difference would it make to label it a marriage?\n\u201cI can\u2019t only give you a charm. You need something to hang it on.\u201d\nWhen she takes it from the box, her fingertips burn. Her ridiculous imagination. Yet she\u2019s relieved to drop it into his hand.\n\u201cClose your eyes again?\u201d\nEllyn complies, listening to his muffled footsteps move along the carpet.\n\u201cKevin? What \u2014 ?\u201d\n\u201cShh,\u201d he whispers, now just behind her. \u201cYou once told me Valentine\u2019s Day is not just a holiday to you. More like your birthday \u2026\u201d\nShe always regretted having that conversation when they\u2019d first met, explaining how her life had changed one February day, all the way back in elementary school. Of course, she\u2019d given no details, but still, she\u2019d hoped he\u2019d forgotten, just as she tries so very hard to do.\n\u201cI want to celebrate you today.\u201d\nHer skin grows hot. From the base of her throat, a bead of sweat slides, snaking a path between her breasts.\n\u201cHold up your hair,\u201d Kevin says. His voice brings her a modicum of calm.\nEllyn does, wishing that he\u2019d chosen a different shape for the charm \u2014 an artist\u2019s palette, a paintbrush, a square, for God\u2019s sake! She giggles, yet when Kevin kisses the top of her head, her body stiffens.\nHe reaches around and puts a necklace on her. Its warm, devastating weight rests upon her bare chest.\nIt can\u2019t be.\nShe touches tentative fingertips to its many charms and leaps out of her chair. She struggles to breathe.\n\u201cWhy \u2014 where did you \u2014\u201d\n\u201cI found it when I cleaned out the closet last week. It\u2019s \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cTake it off me,\u201d she says, hoping to settle her voice. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? What\u2019s the matter? It\u2019s just a kid\u2019s necklace.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d Louder, she says, \u201cTake it off.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to use it. I thought it was funny \u2014\u201d\n\u201cNow.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Kevin says, giving her a smirk. \u201cCalm down.\u201d\nBut the string-of-hearts necklace won\u2019t let Ellyn be calm. It bears down on her skin and her heart and her mind, and she feels herself devolve into a tormented eleven-year-old.\n\u201cHurry up.\u201d She begins to sob.\n\u201cI\u2019m trying \u2014 there\u2019s a knot \u2026\u201d\nHer sobs turn into violent shaking. \u201cYou idiot! Get it the fuck off me!\u201d\n\u201cHoly shit. What the hell, Ellyn?\u201d\nShe rips at the necklace, but the knot holds tight.\nKevin leans close and speaks in a low growl. \u201cYou\u2019re acting like a madwoman.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re ruining everything.\u201d\n\u201cMe?\u201d He snickers, and oh, how Ellyn despises that sound. \u201cI do something nice, and you go nuts.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d She closes her eyes.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something very wrong with you.\u201d\nShe covers her ears.\n\u201cYou\u2019re fucking crazy.\u201d\n\u201cSTOP!\u201d Ellyn screams. When she\u2019s done, the profound silence squeezes in on her. She takes the shallowest of breaths, knowing that hers is the only breath in the room, the only breath anywhere. She lets her hands fall but won\u2019t open her eyes. She doesn\u2019t want to see what the silence has already proven.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she whimpers. Ellyn forces herself to look at Kevin, who\u2019s as inert as one of her sculptures.\n\u201cKevin,\u201d she whispers. She grasps his shoulders and shakes him. \u201cWake up.\u201d\nShe squeezes his hands, feeling their familiar, rough warmth. She grips them more tightly, digging hard with her nails.\n\u201cMove,\u201d she demands. \u201cMove.\u201d\nHe won\u2019t. Of course he won\u2019t, but she has to keep trying, and she does, pounding his chest, his arms, again and again, until her fear and despair surge into something much darker.\nEllyn steps back to study Kevin. She draws her arm back and slaps him with all the brutality she can muster, but his last sneer is still frozen upon his face. She presses her stinging palm against her chest, and the memories inside the necklace swarm her.\n\u201cYou gave me this to laugh at me, didn\u2019t you, Kevin? To remind me what a loser I am!\u201d Her pulse rages, sending fury to her every extremity. She blazes with hatred.\n\u201cIt\u2019s your fault this happened. Everything is your fault. Everything!\u201d she shrieks, spraying his face with spit.\nHer voice, harsh from screaming, startles her. It\u2019s a stranger\u2019s voice\u2014a monster\u2019s. Bile rises in her throat.\nEllyn panics. Think, she tells herself. Think.\nAnd finally she understands. The solution to all her problems \u2014 her loneliness and pain, and the doubt, always the doubt \u2014 is within her, and within her grasp.\nIt\u2019s so very easy. She gags only a little.\nAnd as quick as an evening breeze, it\u2019s done.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

I leave this to any future Hog who may figure out how to read it.\nThe day I was born, I couldn\u2019t see anything. I suppose I was born blind. But as I grew into a little piglet, as they ushered me into better-lit areas, my eyes opened and I began to discern my family.\nThis exciting new world around me was comprised of other Hogs. Soon, though, this was not such a good thing.\nThe first thing I noticed was the incredible stench. Hogs are used to stenches \u2014 but real Hogs, dare I say free Hogs, should be born in the Mud.\nLet me explain.\nThere was a legend among those of our Hog-people who kept the snortal traditions: Some said Mud was a place we went when we were ushered down the final metal ramp to our death.\nSome called it nothing but a rumor to assuage the fears that eroded our minds due to forced proximity to the psychotic ones.\nAs a Keeper, I suggest that Mud is a great place, and it makes my Hog-sons and Hog-daughters happy for a while, before the Hog shit flies in their faces again.\nYou never get used to that.\nI am one of the Keepers, you see. One of the Keepers who was taught to think, who was not spared sentience with our process of Cleansing.\nIt falls on my shoulders to pass this down to the next piglets that come through. Should I fail, our species\u2019 sentience \u2014 dwindling as it is \u2014 will be doomed.\nIt also falls on me, as a Keeper, to do the Cleansing.\nMy first Cleansing was done at the behest of Hog-father Hair \u2014 our people are named after things within the Shed, because we only know of areas outside the Shed through snortal tradition.\n(This is why Keepers have always been so important, and why smart Keepers must be selected before each slaughter-cycle so they can migrate to other Hog populations and propagate the information.)\nBut I digress, because Cleansing is painful, and I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\nPrior to my first Cleansing, I had been briefed on what to expect by my Hog-father, a title for our eldest Keeper.\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing a good thing for the Hog-nation,\u201d he excused, \u201cbecause sentience breeds torment. We chose you as one of a very long line of heroic Keepers to represent us. You have the intelligence to get loose and infiltrate other populations. It is up to you to constantly escape the clutches of the Tormentors. But it is also up to you to Cleanse.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is Cleansing, Hog-father?\u201d\n\u201cLittle Fence,\u201d he told me, using my given name with compassion, \u201cyou may have already seen it. The violent Hogs. The insane Hogs. The claustrophobic ones. The depressive ones.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Hog-father,\u201d I said, nudging up against his belly with my snout in reverence.\nPersonal space was not an idea Hogs had conceived of in recent generations. Only the Keepers were allowed to escape the slaughter pens, and then until they grew so old they drew attention.\nThere was little light in my pen, then, just the scraps that dropped through the slats.\nSometimes, depressed Hogs just collapse and drown in the filth.\nAn observation: For the duration of my existence, every time I have arrived at a new Shed, it has been, if not as dark, then darker than the last. It is almost as if the humans keeping us in these pens want to conceal our condition.\nI digress again. It is easy to become distracted with all the bodies bumping against me, and all the grief built up inside from my attempts at coping.\nBut I must remain calm, and tell my story in this new way with as much truth as I can, so that our history will pass on.\nIt is our most important task, and I have finally developed a written Hog language to carry it. This is my contribution to Keeperhood.\n\u201cA Cleansing, son,\u201d the Hog-father said gravely, \u201cis a psychological process by which we rob incoming piglets of their sentience so that they have no sense of self on which to inflict the pain that their life shall be. We have developed it over thousands of generations; it is sentience-suicide. But it must needs be assisted by generating improper stimulus\/response pairings for the young Hoglet, and as a result it is a difficult process for our compassionate souls to inflict.\u201d\nThe conversation took place amidst much jostling and pressing, and the Hog-father had to stop many times; sometimes he was out of breath, and sometimes because offal had covered his snout and tongue.\nIt took us a long time to converse because of the stops and starts, and we found it hard to concentrate. The humans seemed to do it so much more easily.\n\u201cBetter insanity, however,\u201d the elder Keeper continued, \u201cand a breaking of the mind, than live shoulder to shoulder your entire life, contemplating what things might be like outside of the Shed. Thus is the wisdom handed down through the ages. The more self we are allowed to have, the greater our suffering. Keepers are accorded respect by other Keepers, and it is we who may never let Hogs lose our spark. Our journey is to learn the human language such that we may plead with them to stop. The original Keepers, they grew very angry. Over time, we have developed solutions.\u201d\nHe described the Cleansing to me, and the theories surrounding it.\nNow that it\u2019s my turn to pass it on, I know that I have lost some of the groundwork theory, but it is more important that I get the Cleansing right, isn\u2019t it?\nIt is a Keeper\u2019s Duty, a Keeper\u2019s Purpose to pass on the Cleansing.\nWhen I first performed the rite, it felt devastatingly like the torment we witnessed daily. The Hogs had to be young enough to still get themselves confused with other Hogs, just like I\u2019d seen a human baby do one time between Sheds.\nBut the end of Cleansing justified the means; an insane Hog could not be tormented. They may have acted strangely, but they were capable of pleasure of a sort.\nPerhaps some day our brains might adapt to cope better with our Hellish conditions. It is a Keeper hope.\nBut not yet. The Keepers are forbidden from doing anything but replace themselves.\nIf Keepers were to breed on a large scale, our torment \u2014 as a species \u2014 would magnify. And it is a Keeper\u2019s Creed: the greater good for the greater number.\nBetter insane Hogs who don\u2019t understand their torment than tormented Hogs who contemplate what a life free of torment may look like.\nThat job is for the Keepers.\nThat, and attempting to learn human. The plea is already written on our Keeper snortal tradition, handed down among many generations, and it is to be used as soon as one of us figures out how to say it.\nSince I developed written snortal, it is now written in manure on one of the guard rails that keeps us in.\n(I may not be able to escape this time.)\nAnyway, our note to humanity:\n\u201cHumans; we understand why you\u2019ve kept us. You didn\u2019t think we had an I. Now that we\u2019ve written this note, can we have a bigger Shed?\u201d\nI can only hope their linguists know we\u2019re trying to communicate.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Lee delivers a timely \u2014 and richly told \u2014 fable of power and abuse, and asks uncomfortable questions about abundance, scarcity, appetite and satisfaction. Her work is exquisitely illustrated by UK artist Annie Ridd.\nEvery day you will see tired grey faces by the roadside, begging for scraps, a kind loaf.\nWhen he walks it is as if he is a god. He has amassed the bounty of the earth in his private kingdom where the grass he treads is green; his line of warehouses with their cruel barbed wire floats through everyman\u2019s dreams.\nOnce a month on a Sunday his messenger on horseback arrives at a door with a piece of exquisite paper, scented like almonds. It is an invitation, scrawled in his long white hand \u2014 a loopy style with pretty aristocratic flourishes, his slow proud signature at the end.\nIt is always the women and the girls that he\u2019ll summon; his preference is for the newlywed.\nAfter the messenger trots out of sight, the faces turn to each other, a small scandal ensues. Some go willingly, with the blessings of their loved ones. Others are suspicious: a dinner must be more than a dinner.\nHomes have crumbled because of his kindness, children left in tears, but the virgin girls come home untouched. A dinner is a dinner, they say.\nHe will invite the guests to satiate themselves and at first they might hesitate, but overwhelmed by their hunger they will soon forget themselves; they will disappear. They will gorge to their heart\u2019s content.\nHe will watch them guzzle and gulp, stuffing their pretty cheeks with red meat, devouring and licking, and this most elegant of gourmands will sit back and observe.\nFor the most part he himself will not eat, though sometimes he will suck an oyster out of its shell and other times there will be a small bowl by his arm from which he will pick a small, red, heart-shaped cherry and bite it with a smile.\nBut he will never touch the girl. He has never so much as breathed on a guest. He will seat himself at the other end of the table and remain there until the end of the feast when he will depart and his guest \u2014 bewildered, bloated and inexplicably ashamed \u2014 will be led out by the dwarf in the black and gold suit.\nWho is this Count? Whose charity has lain waste to families, whose generosity has annihilated whole villages, household by household? They say it is in the food itself. There is something that will worm its way into a woman\u2019s heart and shrivel up the soul.\nA woman will return home changed. There will be something resigned about her, else something darker; a strange fury. Even if she kisses her husband with the same sweetness as before, her lips plant doubt on his bearded cheek.\nBut it is only a meal, a precious meal in a land so famished.\nOne cold Sunday the messenger comes for her. Beneath the moon his black horse paws the earth, plumes of breath billow like clouds around its nose.\nThe messenger is masked. His painted face is gold and gleaming, decorated with a strange smile, the expression ambiguous, almost mocking.\nHe presents the invitation with a white gloved hand. The mask leers close and she receives the letter with thanks. Her hands tremble, her face is pale. The black horse rears, the messenger departs.\nAlone again she looks at the letter. The signature of the Count is stark and beautiful.\nGo, says her husband. His face is drawn; he is a sliver of the man he once was. Hunger has wasted away his flesh; he has shriveled up like the corn in the field. The drought has lasted seven years.\nIt will do you good, he says, though she can sense his apprehension. Two skeletons, they are, rattling their way through life. Their wedding feast was the last full meal they had. Neighbors brought reserves to share; it was the first time in months they tasted the sweetness of honey.\nGo, he says, and when she shakes her head he becomes angry. Looks at her withered form, shrivelled over the seasons to a dry husk, her hair once lustrous, her eyes once bright. All has been dulled by hunger and he drops his eyes, turns away, shoulders slumping.\nWord spreads with the ease of a plague. The next day everyone hears of it. If it is not a girl from one village, it will be a girl from another. Somewhere among the lonely villages of this desolate realm there will always be a girl.\nThe date of the feast draws near. She ignores the judgmental eyes, the whispers, the trace of envy on the tongue.\nShe has sold her best dresses for bread and the market has swallowed her jewels, but she will make herself presentable in a plain old smock, scrub her skin to a sheen.\nWhen the carriage arrives she and her husband are waiting before their house, quivering, pinched and brittle, swaying with fatigue in the breeze. Her husband has trimmed his beard though only the horseman will see it and the horseman does not notice such things. He hardly turns his head to look at them. His golden mask is facing forward, catching the dying light of the sun.\nEat your fill, my love.\nShe is packed into the carriage and sits on cushions black and lush. The horses pull, the wheels roll. She watches her home grow smaller but draws the curtains when they pass the village square.\nShe sits back into scant malnourished thoughts. Her body rocks with the movements of the carriage and the interior is warm as a womb.\nIn the distance the Count\u2019s castle is grey, forbidding. It is made of hostile stones, turrets stab the sky, ravens circle the upper reaches.\nThe iron gates swing open, the carriage glides through. But here \u2014 what a sight! \u2014 there is a carpet of luxuriant grass, green as sin, and rows of blissful flowers, awash with sordid colours. A maid is watering the garden from a golden pot; it is strange \u2014 shocking \u2014 to see such precious water lavished on beauty. It gushes from the spout without restraint.\nInto the hall she is ushered. The ceiling is high and carved with angels; the floor is smooth stone eroded by generations of courtly feet. A dwarf greets her in a black and gold suit and leads her through long corridors of hanging flames and tapestries. Their footsteps ring and echo.\nNo words pass between them. No one has spoken to her since she boarded the carriage. She is unsure of her guide\u2019s appearance. He marches briskly; she sees only the bobbing shape of his large round head, the golden tassels that sway on his shoulders.\nHer pulse quickens as they progress deeper in. She smells before she sees: the rich aroma of warm stew, the pungency of spice and garlic, the juicy odor of racks of meat, the sugary scent of a party of cakes.\nIt pierces her, this gunshot of smell. She is filled with the fumes of the feast and she sighs and salivates. Her mouth moistens wildly.\nThey are at the end of the corridor; now the oak doors open. They are heavy doors, old doors, doors from an earlier, primitive age.\nThe hall is filled with light. Candles glow along the gleaming table amid a mountain of dishes. The chocolates twinkle, the salamis shine, the yellow cheeses smoulder.\nSo much food, alive with heat. Steaming risottos, bubbling casseroles, simmering broths.\nCheeses pile on top of cheeses: hard cheeses, soft cheeses, cheeses white as cream, cheeses streaked with blue and salty veins, cheeses like fat wheels nestled in dark waxy rinds.\nThere are thick, succulent sausages, glistening skins slightly caramelised, meat rich in flavor. Browned legs of lamb, hunks of crispy pork with a small jar of apple sauce beside them. Bloody steaks, sweet treats aplenty.\nHer eyes drift towards pyramids of macaroons in pastel pinks and blues, dense melting chocolate cakes oozing their luxury onto plates of burnished gold, ramekins of cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9es shining in amber glazes, and rows of vivid red-raspberry tarts.\nThere are airy profiteroles and syrupy sponges, crunchy meringues with gooey innards, fruit trifles and crystallized candies, vats of smooth vanilla custard, and sticky white rice cakes brought in from the East.\nAt the other end of the table where the host will sit are dishes for more expensive tastes: delicate caviar from the Caspian Sea, slabs of soft foie gras, grilled lobsters flame-red, and champagne jellies luminous with flakes of pure gold. Somewhere hovers the earthy scent of truffles.\nListen! Footsteps resound in the stone corridor; the echoes draw close. He is striding in even, measured steps towards the feasting hall.\nWhen he sweeps in, he does not so much as glance at her. He brushes by, his movement stirs her strands of hair and she wonders about her host with his queer scent of almonds. He takes his seat at the end of the table.\nHis chest and arms sprout hairs, thick and black that escape through his rolled up sleeves and the open collar of his shirt.\nYet he is dressed in elite fashions. His shirt is clean and the purest white that she has seen for years, a white no longer present in her village where all the clothes have faded and nothing new is worn. It is the whitest of whites with a cold blue tint, the white of faraway peaks shrouded by silent clouds.\nHe smiles now at his guest. It is an ominous smile, too smooth to be honest and his teeth are sharp.\nYet there is an unmistakable handsomeness to him.\nHe motions for her to begin, and tentatively she reaches for a small slice of pie. It is a golden pie steaming with heat, succulent with meat. She brings the slice to her lips; the texture is moist, the pastry breaks a little between her fingers and crumbs tumble onto her lap.\nThe Count leans forward. He nods, flicks his long white hands and gestures for her to eat, eat.\nSlowly her teeth sink through soft pastry; the tender flavours melt on her tongue and bathe her spirit in salty delight. She is transported momentarily to a higher plane and she thinks, when was the last time? That honey present on her wedding day, a stack of cheeses when they gave their vows. A few meek pleasures, all those years ago.\nAnd she thinks of her home, so bleak, so austere. Her husband by the bare cupboard, shoulders slumped; his face wasting, his body atrophying, a mountain slowly eroding to dust.\nHer saucer eyes survey the feast, the profusion of colours, smells and flavours. There is so much joy in a dish; each morsel contains within itself a bright piece of light. There is a promise of happiness in a bite, an opportunity to recover and live again.\nShe trembles. She holds the small slice of pie in her hands and she thinks, for too long I have lived off a grain that does not nourish me, half-starved, dying before my time is up. Too long, too long, I cannot contain myself any longer.\nShe reaches out and begins to pile her plate with lashings of meat. She feasts on pink hams and yellow cheeses, fills a bowl with soup and breaks some crusty bread. She spoons soft couscous into her mouth, dines on canap\u00e9s of smoked salmon decked with lemon.\nAs she sips and slurps, champs and chews, new thoughts seep insidiously into her mind and chase one another through the labyrinthine passages and stairs.\nHow criminal it would be to wither one\u2019s way through life, languishing in unfulfilled desires, steeped in a perpetual hunger. How wretched to be confined to a state of acceptance, to rot away from the inside out. How shameful, how miserable!\nOne must eat, savor and enjoy. Consume with relish else life is but a shadow on a wall. Each mouthful stirs her soul. Now it pulses, now it soars.\nShe picks up the cupcakes, so pretty and pink. She cracks the hard caramel layer of a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, dips strawberries into lagoons of dark chocolate.\nShe indulges in aubergines roasted in olive oil, enjoys the chewy texture of halloumi. Her teeth pierce glistening sausage flesh; her lips and fingers shine with juice.\nNow she sets to work on a thick steak, cutting it up with a silver knife and fork to find the outside beautifully seared while the meat inside is red. She chews quickly; she is in heaven. There is a reckless abandon to her eating for she wants everything and she cannot wait.\nAnd there, hovering above the silver soup tureen is his ominous smile, teeth white as polished rice. That perfumed menace; he watches her more intently as she progresses deeper and deeper into delirium, mouthful by mouthful.\nBut now she notices him. Her fingers freeze, her mouth hangs partially open; she is for a moment paralyzed. She sees how amidst the intensity of his gaze, a peculiar cloudiness has crept in, frosting his eyes with a ferocious, dreamlike quality.\nWith a thunderclap she is brought back to her senses. Her heart pounds, her mind whirls. She covers her face. The feast is done.\nThe Count rises from his chair. He does not look at her. His steps are slow and relaxed. The oak doors open; he slides out without a word.\nShe hears the tap of his footsteps on stone. The footsteps recede.\nAlone in the hall, a sigh escapes her: the low, aching sigh of a woman who has recognized the depth of her dissatisfaction.\nThere is a new sound in the corridor. The shuffling footfall of the dwarf. The golden tassels on his shoulders sway, his large round head bobs. He leads her out of the feasting hall, no warmth in his manner.\nShe ascends the carriage and there is only the rhythmic sound of the turning wheels, the plodding hooves and the flay of the whip for company.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Although I could easily have taken what residents called the Innerloop or Outerloop highways between my apartment and the office, I chose to drive the major avenues instead.\nThey were lined with massive sycamores that provided breeze and shade, and I never knew what store or sight I might encounter. In this way, I had found a factory from which anyone could buy painters\u2019 pants, a butcher who made sausage, a pancake and waffle restaurant that was completely underground, and a confectioner who made different types of licorice.\nWhen I told co-workers about my discoveries, they were amused.\n\u201cYou know more about this city than the people who grew up here,\u201d one said.\nOne day, on my way home, I saw a sign for a cafeteria and decided to stop for dinner. I had grown up in a city with different types of cafeterias, and I hoped that this might be like one of those childhood memories.\nI turned left off the avenue, left again, and drove down a gently sloping street to a small parking lot with several other cars outside a well-lit restaurant. I hadn\u2019t known this little neighborhood was here, although for a minute it seemed familiar to me.\nThe houses were small duplexes or cottages, and all were surrounded by masses of flowers.\n\u201cMust be good soil here,\u201d I thought.\nAlthough the avenue was only a few blocks away, I could barely hear traffic noise. I went in and asked the server for macaroni and cheese and a bowl of vegetable soup.\nThe food was good, but it was the sense of peace I felt there that made me smile and let out a sigh of contentment.\n\u201cYou local?\u201d asked the woman who had dished up my food.\n\u201cWell, I live and work in the city, but I\u2019m not originally from here,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd my lease is up soon, so I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll stay here or move back to where I\u2019m from.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s an apartment for rent in that white duplex across the street, if you\u2019re interested.

I can come down and look at the apartment another day. I pass this way all the time.\u201d\n\u201cYes, leave your number with me,\u201d she said.\nI wrote my home and work phone numbers down on a piece of paper and handed it to her, and she folded it and put it in her apron pocket.\n\u201cThis place is wonderful,\u201d I said. \u201cI really enjoyed it. I hope to see you again.\u201d\nI paid my bill, and she thanked me.\n\u201cGood-bye now,\u201d she said.\nWhen I got home I put my checkbook in my handbag, in case the landlord called while I was at work the next day. He didn\u2019t call, though, and I decided to stop by the cafeteria and ask to see the apartment.\nThere wasn\u2019t a sign where I thought I remembered it, and the street I drove down after leaving the avenue didn\u2019t lead me anywhere except to ranch houses with children playing in the yards and parents coming home from work.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the cafeteria near here?\u201d I called to one man.\n\u201cNo cafeteria near here,\u201d he called back. \u201cThe closest restaurants are on the avenue.\u201d\nI drove around for an hour or more looking for the cafeteria, but never came across it.

Neighbors were starved or raped or humiliated. Children played peacekeeper and sniper. Their parents\u2019 hair had gone white or fallen out or lay wrapped with their bones in early graves, scattered among the memories of homes and order.\nIt no longer mattered who had started the war or who was in the right.\nSuffering hung over everyone and brought no one satisfaction, least of all the gods who had once been entertained by humans. It had become too much. Because the ground was wet with blood and tears. Because the young should not be experts in shrouds and makeshift markers.\nThe townspeople brought in negotiators to navigate the loss and implored the gods they had forgotten to end the pain. And the gods \u2014 of war, of hunting, of love, of all \u2014 could not bear to witness any more. They agreed that the citizens of this town should, from then on, live well into old age and die only of natural causes.\nIt was the Time of Calm.\nFor three generations the people lived in peace, thankful for long lives, surrounded by those they loved \u2014 or tolerated.\nFor the first generation, it felt like a reprieve, a time to learn how to breathe again without the chest clinch of fear. When these children of war became the grandparents of peace, they marveled at their survival and luck, told their offspring to be grateful, to cherish each other and every breath that was full.\nTheir children \u2014 like most children of survivors \u2014 absorbed these lessons, felt guilt when they would forget to mark each day with gratitude, and held on to the idea of tradition as they slowly let go of the rituals.\nIt was the third generation, spoiled by comfort, that began to question the possibility of an entire town living into old age \u2014 no premature strokes, no fatal accidents, no suicides despite the pain deep in some.\nThey began to test their theory that they were blessed or chosen or at least unique. In the way that children will pull a spider\u2019s legs off to see if it will survive, they would throw themselves off roofs, first small and known, then from cliffs into waters cold and untested.\nThis is what they found: their bones would break, a few might become paralyzed, scars would not heal, but they never died \u2014 not a one.\nIt took a few years for all the possibilities to flower in their minds.\nThey began with the weak or different, asserting their strength and testing their cruelties quietly, behind stadiums, where their families and teachers could not hear.\nSlowly, the old divisions returned, and after a few years, or maybe decades, once the citizens had reduced each other to crawling, limping, blind, muted and torn, the gods \u2014 horrified at the townspeople\u2019s capacity for cruelty \u2014 lifted the blessing and once again welcomed the siege.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

The highlights of their report included the following:\n- Highest form of intelligence indeterminate.\n- Archaic digestive systems and nourishment practices.\n- Life spans comparable to primitives on V12.\n- Conflicts frequently resolved with violence.\n- Cruelty inflicted on other species.\n- Technology misused and lethal.\n- Atmosphere and surface contamination high.\n- Leaders mostly ineffective, arrogant, and ambitious.\nThe list extended two hundred lines and cast an overwhelmingly negative image of Earthlings, but there were a few exceptions:\n- Interesting tonal manipulation with instruments.\n- Nurturing behavior with infants and infirm.\n- Extensive diversity of spoken idioms.\n- High participation in competitive games.\n- Still and animated visual material prized.\n- Plant arrangements accentuate dwellings and public spaces.\n- Myriad dry goods emporiums.\nHowever, in the aggregate, the cons outweighed the pros ten to one.\nThis did not surprise the V12 researchers, since they had encountered similar outcomes elsewhere during their many exploratory assignments in several different planetary constellations.\nAs the intergalactic visitors prepared for transfer home, they experienced an irregularity in their vision, which they deduced was a reaction to some disparate compound in the exotic planet\u2019s four basic elements.\nTheir sight normally colorless, except for black and white, now discerned all degrees of red, and it had a strange effect on them.\nAlways astute and emotionally detached, they began to experience fuzzy thinking and felt sensual arousal in the presence of their faux gender opposites. This led to experimentation with their human genitalia and ultimately physical union.\nFor a full day they engaged in libidinous activities until their energy flagged and they lay exhausted in a naked knot.\nWhen they began to revive, another anomaly occurred in their sight. They could now see yellow objects, and the aberrant behavior inspired by the color red was supplanted by extreme anxiety, verging on panic.\nThey quickly dressed and locked the doors and drew the shades in their living quarters, where they remained silent and alert lest something horrible occur.\nWhen night passed and the sun seeped through the window coverings, the V12s felt their anxiety dissipate, replaced by a rapidly expanding sense of wellbeing. They could now perceive another vivid hue\u2014this one was blue.\nAlmost instantly, they experienced intoxicating exhilaration and joy, something unknown to them in their long existences.\n\u201cWeeip err hurup,\u201d uttered one of the male V12s, observing the wondrous change that had come over him.\n\u201cSherp ssss fafa waiow,\u201d responded the female V12, noting how strange and superb she, too, felt.\nUnable to contain the euphoria prompted by all things blue in their field of vision, they left their confines to bask more fully in their newest human sensation.\nHappily, they set about to benefit the planet with their advanced knowledge and formidable powers.\nIn the following weeks, they had significantly improved the quality of life for all of Earth\u2019s living creatures. For example, humans no longer got acne, venomous snakes became loving house pets, and Big Macs and Whoppers became healthy alternatives. However, in their exultation the aliens had overlooked their transfer date and would suffer dire consequences.\nThe V12s realized their mistake when their ability to see colors faded, and their vision returned to black and white.\n\u201cEeow maiow prrow,\u201d said one of the galaxy jumpers, declaring that it would be 5600 wextars before a series of nebula would shift enough to permit them unimpeded passage to their habitat.\n\u201cWe will not last,\u201d declared another, using the native tongue.\nAfter some discussion, they decided to preserve as much of their power source as possible in order to last the sixteen Earth days until departure.\nThey planned to accomplish this by entering a state of suspended animation and by denying any non-V12 impulses that might attempt to assert themselves.\nTo insure the success of the latter, they covered their eyes to prevent the invasion of color into their ocular pathways.\nOn the twelfth day of self-imposed isolation, their human disguises began to molder and by the time of their scheduled transfer pieces of the simulated dermal covering had fallen away from the voyagers it was designed to conceal.\nThe stench of rotting tissue permeated the small apartment building where they anxiously awaited embarkation. The foul odor aroused neighbors and the building\u2019s superintendent tracked the fumes to the V12\u2019s rental.\nHe knocked on the door several times, but rather than enter the flat for fear of encountering a gruesome scene, he called the police.\n\u201cSomething\u2019s dead in there,\u201d observed one of the two officers outside the door behind which the V12s awaited their molecular shuttle.\nWhen they took the super\u2019s key and opened the door, the rancid vapors hit them like a tidal wave and they buried their noses in their sleeves as they entered the tenement.\nThey immediately recognized the source of the stench.\nPiled before them were four carcasses.\n\u201cJesus,\u201d gagged the building super backing out of the apartment.\n\u201cWhat the hell \u2026 they look like deflated dummies. Like they have no bones,\u201d commented the younger officer.\n\u201cBetter call the coroner\u2019s office and homicide, Bob. We got some real strange stuff here.\u201d\nA sudden noise came from behind the mound of limp corpses causing the rookie policeman to jump.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that? Something moved over there!\u201d he exclaimed, drawing his gun from his holster.\n\u201cCool it, Bob. It\u2019s nothing. Look.\u201d He peered beyond the decomposed cadavers to four black and white cats of varying sizes and breeds.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be damned. Thought they were \u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat? The boogeyman?\u201d said the elder cop mockingly. \u201cYou\u2019re as big a pussy as they are. Let\u2019s get those freaking mousers out of here before they eat the evidence.\u201d\nAs they moved toward the huddled animals, a bright flash filled the room.

So you assume.\nWhen he does leave his house, your invisible neighbor is usually wearing only a few articles of clothing at a time. A hat, some gloves in the winter, shoes (of course!), and maybe a jaunty little scarf or ascot, those year-round because they\u2019re fashionable. Only with gloves on can you tell if he\u2019s waving back at you.\nWhen he walks his dog \u2014 his visible dog \u2014 all you can really see of him passing you by on the street is a floating leash attached to his dog\u2019s collar. It\u2019s funny when the dog suddenly pulls left or right, because the floating leash just whips and zooms away with him, and you have to imagine the expression on your invisible neighbor\u2019s face.\nYour invisible neighbor\u2019s dog is named Herbert George, after the H.G. in H.G. Wells, who once wrote a book he called The Invisible Man. Your invisible neighbor loves that book. You gave him a really nice copy of it a few Christmases ago, one all decorated with silver on the front. You\u2019re pretty sure he really appreciated it, but since you couldn\u2019t see his face you\u2019re not totally sure. But he sounded pleased.\nYour invisible neighbor doesn\u2019t talk much. Or at least, not to you. He seems to prefer the solitude of being, you guess, the only invisible man in a very visible neighborhood. You wonder sometimes if he doesn\u2019t get lonely, all invisible and alone with his dog and his house, but when you do talk to each other, he seems nothing but cheerful.\nYou find your invisible neighbor kind of funny, even if \u2014 and I agree with you here \u2014 he is a little weird. But maybe he has the right to be weird. Maybe it\u2019s right for him. There seems to be no one in the whole world the exact same kind of weird as him. And that\u2019s sort of beautiful.\nWhen you need your invisible neighbor\u2019s help with something, or have a favor to ask him, he\u2019s always got your back. He must be \u2014 at least a little bit \u2014 super strong, because he is a master at moving furniture around. He\u2019s rearranged your living room five times already, single-handedly! Your invisible neighbor says he\u2019s always happy to help. He says that\u2019s what neighbors are for.\nYou\u2019ve never asked him how he became invisible, or if he\u2019s always been invisible, and you probably never will. It doesn\u2019t feel appropriate. You don\u2019t want your precious few conversations to get too uncomfortable. But still, your mind likes to wander. Was it some kind of nuclear testing accident? A voluntary experiment gone wrong? Was he born invisible? Are either of his parents invisible?\nHe\u2019s never mentioned his family before, and he never has visitors or travels anywhere for the holidays. You wonder.\nYou think about your invisible neighbor often, and sometimes with unexpected fondness. You hope he thinks about you, too, but you doubt he does. You\u2019re used to doubting.\nWhen the doorbell rings one day when it\u2019s raining and you open the front door to see a trench coat, boots and gloves attempting to close a wet umbrella while wrangling a dog and his floating leash, after you pull them both inside and your invisible neighbor tells you all about how he\u2019s locked himself out of the house, how silly of him, but could he and Herbert George please dry off and warm up in your lovely home because you\u2019re the neighbor they know best, and could your invisible neighbor use your phone to call a locksmith, and once he\u2019s done that he tells you how the locksmith is charging extra for having to drive so far uptown and in this rain of all things; when all this happens, you finally realize you\u2019re in love with your invisible neighbor.\nAnd when, a little while later, you\u2019re sitting together talking by the fireplace, snoring dog calm on the rug between your armchairs, sipping hot tea that you can just see going into the place where your invisible neighbor\u2019s mouth should be, in the middle of a casual conversation that somehow went from stories about losing keys to an analysis of Oscar Wilde and 19th century morals, after you accidentally mention something you\u2019ve noticed about how your invisible neighbor likes to keep his rose garden, something he says no one\u2019s ever noticed before; at that moment, without really saying it yet, your invisible neighbor tells you he loves you, too.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Days of lying on your back at the mercy of mutant molecules coiling viciously up your brain tubes, of your neurons unlinking and firing randomly into the air like Cossacks at a village wedding. The unending suspicion that the floor keeps moving to some other place.\nDays of training your liquefied consciousness towards the same clean, dry, nausea-busting images: snow-capped mountains, stacks of library books, perhaps some boy scouts reciting the Pledge of Allegiance while standing in an amber wave of grain. Anything to pull your mind back from the image of boiling vindaloo curry with nacho cheese sauce dumped on top.\nAn extended exile from personality, from humor, from the willing invitation of garden-variety risk and darkness into your life.

More Gatorade. More Saltine crackers. More finding patterns in the ceiling paint. More daytime naps where you don\u2019t sleep. What helps? What harms?

You\u2019ve become a spectator. Others\u2019 lives are unending pageants of adventure and novelty. Yours is a less traumatic version of this\u2014of waiting inside warm, sweating white walls of fever without delirium. This epiphany surges forth into your mouth like a ball of molten lava, hotter and more hellish for its long gestation inside.\nEach Saltine cracker mocks you. You have lost something. You are trapped inside a Pottery Barn catalogue: a place where no matter how hard you try to do something raw, primitive and foolish for which you could end up paying the rest of your life, you will still wake up in a place where the pillow shams match the ottoman and you are covered by ten different types of liability insurance.\nAt long last, the return to the workforce. The slapping cold and the pushing grey crowds. The vigor of honest toil.\nProofread long legal documents in a near-empty office as the sun goes down. Sleep on the berber carpet under the desk when the boss isn\u2019t around. Still inside you the viral braindrug residue, your body holding your soul at arm\u2019s length.\nStand at the 32nd floor window. Watch the pulsing electric veins of Friday night traffic racetracking through on-ramps and off-ramps and bridge-bound overpasses. Down on Folsom Street, crowds swarm around the red and green neon sign of a nightclub you danced at in the Nineties.\nGod, enchiladas! Who\u2019s for enchiladas? Great oily platters of seething, noxious soul food, the taste that contains all love and horror, the things you want inside you that you don\u2019t want to know about. You need it. You know you can\u2019t handle it.\nYou think you\u2019re better now. Are you better? Are you cured? Are you sure? You\u2019d better be sure.\nYou\u2019re not sure of anything. Only that everything is all right now, and somehow you want it not to be. You are tired of being a tourist. The acid, flesh-dissolving slime you have barely climbed up out of is the artery you need to spike. Mortality has made itself known to you lately, but where is its sex? Where is its danger? Why does it lurk nerdily like a bespectacled auditor waiting for a miscount? Why does it not kiss and undress and drink and play chess with you, as it does with people in the movies? Where is the Enchilada of Death?\nCall your friends. Nobody answers. If you carry on alone towards your impulse\u2014eat too much Turkish food, get a gullet full of illegally brewed fire water and drive your car into a telephone pole, repeatedly, while singing along with the radio in a language you don\u2019t speak\u2014will it even be real? Who will bear witness?\nLook out through the canyons of office-building towers, the grids of square cubicles blinking out one by one for the weekend. One hundred feet away through the air, behind a glass wall like yours, someone is silhouetted against a glowing red Coke machine, trying to decide. Five down four across, a man barks into his cell phone and grips the edge of his desk.\nOut by the docks, a world away, a lone smokestack spouts a nobly apocalyptic white column up to the sky.\nThat skyscraper over there, they\u2019ve been working on it forever. You can still look straight through its bare bones, through the halogen worklights posted on its naked steel joints, to the green hills on the edge of the city and the clouds beyond. Always one or two figures standing out there on those platforms, standing right on the edge of that terrifying drop with no safety rail, nothing to catch them below. You can\u2019t see their faces, can\u2019t know anything about them. They could be old school friends of yours. Don\u2019t they get Friday nights off? Christ, what must the wind be like?\nThe giant fishing-pole tower crane on top swings its bait, a greenish glass panel the size of your bedroom wall, slowly over in front of the structure. It fits \u2026 right there, above and next to all the dozens of other outsized glass panels that have already been affixed to the front of the building. Pop, lock, and it\u2019s in. The crane slowly pivots to pick up the next panel.\nThat\u2019s it? That\u2019s all they do? That\u2019s all that separates every office worker in the developed world from complete oblivion? They make it look like a fucking game of Tetris.\nSo what happens if \u2026 one panel must weigh at least 150 pounds. The drop would be five hundred feet. Would there even be debris after it hit the ground? Or would the sheer force of the blow vaporize the whole thing into a mushroom cloud of breathable glass fibers? Would it billow out into the street, out into the waiting lines of nightclub hipsters, out to the Lexus drivers fumbling for their keys and getting ready to spend an hour on the bridge? Would it ruin lungs? Disfigure faces? Isn\u2019t there some sort of safety\u2026latch or cord or something? How to find out?\nFuck it. Have a Coke and a smile. The vending machine in the dark, empty lounge room mechanically sucks in your dollar. You\u2019ve read all the articles, you know how bad this shit is for you. The sugar, the additives, the cornstarch, the greenwashing, the Orwellian ad psychology, the murdered union organizers at the Latin American bottling plants, to hell with \u2019em. You need the taste of reckless childhood.\nThe marketers even have a psychographic category for you: Occasional Indulger. They know what you\u2019re looking for better than you do. Their sales strategy one-sheets probably describe Nirvana more accurately than anything the Dalai Lama ever wrote.\nBut oh, that plastic buzz is real enough in its fake-ass way. The cold and the fizz and the simple glucose snap-crackle-pop in your veins. You feel almost normal, looking down at the twilight city through inch-thick glass drinking a Coke from a machine. It\u2019s not the real thing. It never will be. But for now, it will have to do. You\u2019ve got some shit to figure out.\nFocus. Keep your eyes fixed on one thing for five minutes, it\u2019ll help you concentrate. The yelling cell phone guy in the building across the way, how about him, he\u2019s pretty entertaining.\nOkay. Make a plan. Operation Bland Night of the Soul. A change of scenery\u2014yes, definitely called for. Spend the night in the woods or something. Your cousin with the cabin\u2026of course, you haven\u2019t spoken to him in years\u2026still, the sound of that river running\u2026a shed full of firewood and that musty, piney vacation smell when you open the door of the place. Birds. Spiders. Chipmunks, that kind of thing. Some time to be intentionally alone, get all spooked out. Take your old English lit books, make some coffee and eggs, kick the pinecones around. Let your defenses down. No cars, no people, no bullshit, get a serious plan together. Start kicking some existential ass. Yes. It all becomes clear.\nBefore the Coke you were sleepy and spacey. Now you\u2019re buzzed and spacey.\nARE YOU GONNA GIVE THAT COUSIN A CALL, SOLDIER? yells the man into his cell phone.\nYes, Sir! Salute him across the glass canyon.\nARE YOU GONNA HAVE A HIPPIE-ASS MENDO WEEKEND?\nYes, Sir!

A little catch in your throat getting ready to be a sound.\nThere\u2019s this tiny flicker of wanting to do something. Anything. But there\u2019s nothing you can do.\nApart, that is, from wanting to be there.

Illustrations for The Fabulist by Adam Myers.\nThe \u201cRed Death\u201d had long devastated the country. No pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and its seal \u2014 the redness and the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution. The scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim, were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellow-men. And the whole seizure, progress and termination of the disease, were the incidents of half an hour.\nBut the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious. When his dominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his presence a thousand hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys. This was an extensive and magnificent structure, the creation of the prince\u2019s own eccentric yet august taste. A strong and lofty wall girdled it in. This wall had gates of iron. The courtiers, having entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts. They resolved to leave means neither of ingress nor egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within. The abbey was amply provisioned. With such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to contagion. The external world could take care of itself. In the meantime it was folly to grieve, or to think. The prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure. There were buffoons, there were improvisatori, there were ballet-dancers, there were musicians, there was Beauty, there was wine. All these and security were within. Without was the \u201cRed Death\u201d.\nIt was towards the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion, and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad, that the Prince Prospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence.\nIt was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade. But first let me tell of the rooms in which it was held. These were seven \u2014 an imperial suite. In many palaces, however, such suites form a long and straight vista, while the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand, so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded. Here the case was very different, as might have been expected from the duke\u2019s love of the bizarre. The apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one at a time. There was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect. To the right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow Gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of the suite. These windows were of stained glass whose colour varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened. That at the eastern extremity was hung, for example in blue \u2014 and vividly blue were its windows. The second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes were purple. The third was green throughout, and so were the casements. The fourth was furnished and lighted with orange \u2014 the fifth with white \u2014 the sixth with violet. The seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls, falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue. But in this chamber only, the colour of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations. The panes here were scarlet \u2014 a deep blood colour. Now in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum, amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof. There was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers. But in the corridors that followed the suite, there stood, opposite to each window, a heavy tripod, bearing a brazier of fire, that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room. And thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances. But in the western or black chamber the effect of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark hangings through the blood-tinted panes, was ghastly in the extreme, and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered, that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all.\nIt was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the western wall, a gigantic clock of ebony. Its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the minute-hand made the circuit of the face, and the hour was to be stricken, there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical, but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that, at each lapse of an hour, the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause, momentarily, in their performance, to harken to the sound; and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the chimes of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew pale, and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused revery or meditation. But when the echoes had fully ceased, a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly, and made whispering vows, each to the other, that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion; and then, after the lapse of sixty minutes, (which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the Time that flies,) there came yet another chiming of the clock, and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before.\nBut, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel. The tastes of the duke were peculiar. He had a fine eye for colours and effects. He disregarded the decora of mere fashion. His plans were bold and fiery, and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre. There are some who would have thought him mad. His followers felt that he was not. It was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was not.\nHe had directed, in great part, the movable embellishments of the seven chambers, upon occasion of this great f\u00eate; and it was his own guiding taste which had given character to the masqueraders. Be sure they were grotesque. There were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phantasm \u2014 much of what has been since seen in \u201cHernani\u201d. There were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments. There were delirious fancies such as the madman fashions. There were much of the beautiful, much of the wanton, much of the bizarre, something of the terrible, and not a little of that which might have excited disgust. To and fro in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude of dreams. And these \u2014 the dreams \u2014 writhed in and about taking hue from the rooms, and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps. And, anon, there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet. And then, for a moment, all is still, and all is silent save the voice of the clock. The dreams are stiff-frozen as they stand. But the echoes of the chime die away \u2014 they have endured but an instant \u2014 and a light, half-subdued laughter floats after them as they depart. And now again the music swells, and the dreams live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever, taking hue from the many tinted windows through which stream the rays from the tripods. But to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven, there are now none of the maskers who venture; for the night is waning away; and there flows a ruddier light through the blood-coloured panes; and the blackness of the sable drapery appals; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet, there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulged in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments.\nBut these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat feverishly the heart of life. And the revel went whirlingly on, until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock. And then the music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before. But now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock; and thus it happened, perhaps, that more of thought crept, with more of time, into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled. And thus too, it happened, perhaps, that before the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single individual before. And the rumour of this new presence having spread itself whisperingly around, there arose at length from the whole company a buzz, or murmur, expressive of disapprobation and surprise \u2014 then, finally, of terror, of horror, and of disgust.\nIn an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation. In truth the masquerade licence of the night was nearly unlimited; but the figure in question had out-Heroded Herod, and gone beyond the bounds of even the prince\u2019s indefinite decorum. There are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion. Even with the utterly lost, to whom life and death are equally jests, there are matters of which no jest can be made. The whole company, indeed, seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed. The figure was tall and gaunt, and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave. The mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat. And yet all this might have been endured, if not approved, by the mad revellers around. But the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type of the Red Death. His vesture was dabbled in blood \u2014 and his broad brow, with all the features of the face, was besprinkled with the scarlet horror.\nWhen the eyes of the Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image (which, with a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain its role, stalked to and fro among the waltzers) he was seen to be convulsed, in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste; but, in the next, his brow reddened with rage.\n\u201cWho dares,\u201d \u2014 he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near him \u2014 \u201cwho dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery? Seize him and unmask him \u2014 that we may know whom we have to hang, at sunrise, from the battlements!\u201d\nIt was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the Prince Prospero as he uttered these words. They rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearly, for the prince was a bold and robust man, and the music had become hushed at the waving of his hand.\nIt was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of pale courtiers by his side. At first, as he spoke, there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder, who at the moment was also near at hand, and now, with deliberate and stately step, made closer approach to the speaker. But from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole party, there were found none who put forth hand to seize him; so that, unimpeded, he passed within a yard of the prince\u2019s person; and, while the vast assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first, through the blue chamber to the purple \u2014 through the purple to the green \u2014 through the green to the orange \u2014 through this again to the white \u2014 and even thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him. It was then, however, that the Prince Prospero, maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice, rushed hurriedly through the six chambers, while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all. He bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three or four feet of the retreating figure, when the latter, having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer. There was a sharp cry \u2014 and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet, upon which, instantly afterwards, fell prostrate in death the Prince Prospero. Then, summoning the wild courage of despair, a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave cerements and corpse-like mask, which they handled with so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form.\nAnd now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death. He had come like a thief in the night. And one by one dropped the revellers in the blood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died each in the despairing posture of his fall. And the life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay. And the flames of the tripods expired. And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all.\nRELATED: \u201cWhat can Poe teach us about the pandemic?\u201d","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Neil continues to snore softly beside me. Nothing short of a fire alarm disturbs that one. I peer out the tiny window and see the rear-end of what looks like a very old lady standing on the steps. Contorting myself in the cramped space, I crawl over Neil, who grunts and turns over, cocooning in the worn comforter.\nStepping into my Crocs, I open the door, putting a stop to the incessant noise. The smell of cedar and pine is delicious after the stale air inside. She takes a step back when I appear, perhaps realizing even in her distress that social distancing is important. Her face is dry whiteness, her lower jaw slightly unhinged, she wears jarring colors: purple fleecy pants and a pink t-shirt stretched over breasts that hang almost to her navel.\n\u201cMarianne is gone,\u201d she says, in a near-whisper. \u201cI need help.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s Marianne?\u201d\n\u201cMy little girl.\u201d\n\u201cOh my God. How old is she?\u201d\n\u201cSeven.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u201cMavis.\u201d\nShe turns even paler for an instant, and I jump down from the steps to hold her elbow. We walk awkwardly over to her RV. The door is open, swinging in the early morning breeze. She sits down heavily in a folding chair and stares at her thighs for a long moment. A tiny mouse appears from under the RV, twitches, then disappears.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful day,\u201d she says.\n\u201cYes, August is always nice at this spot. Didn\u2019t I see you with your husband yesterday? Where is he?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where Lewis is.\u201d\nA large pileated woodpecker startles us, a flying blur of black, white, and red.\n\u201cMavis, your daughter?\u201d\nShe looks alert again. \u201cYes, we have to find her. We have to\u2026\u201d her voice trails off again.\n\u201cStay here. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\nI jog around the campsite, looking for signs of movement or a hiding child. There are four other RVs, parked at haphazard angles, each with a leafy semblance of privacy. Behind the wall of birdsong there is only quiet.\nThough I haven\u2019t communicated with any of the other campers beyond half-smiles and awkward waves, I imagine we are all relieved to be outside, away from the kitchen sink and CNN, in the familiarity of strangers, after the long pandemic lockdown.\nI look back at Mavis. She wipes her drippy nose with the back of a trembling hand, staring into space. Stepping back into my RV, I grab Neil by the shoulder and shake him.\n\u201cWake up. There\u2019s a kid missing. We need to find her.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? What?\u201d Neil rubs his stubbly black beard, stretches and farts loudly. His \u201cmorning trumpet,\u201d as he calls it.\n\u201cGet up quick. A little girl went missing from the RV across the way. Marianne.\u201d\nNeil rolls off the bed and starts pulling on his boxers.\nOutside again, I see that Mavis is waking up other families. She\u2019s standing at RV #5 and the family inside has spilled out, bedheads listening to her with concern. Two moms and three teenage children. Neil joins me.\nBefore long, there is a congregation of campers assembled in the middle of the clearing, being careful to socially distance. Three campers are wearing cloth masks. Introductions are hastily made. Crisis as the ultimate ice-breaker.\n\u201cDo you have a picture of her on your phone?\u201d asks Neil.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a phone,\u201d says Mavis, \u201cShe has short blond hair, green eyes, and lots of freckles. She\u2019s only seven.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is she wearing?\u201d I ask.\nMavis narrows her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d she says, at last.\nNeil sidles closer to me and I recoil from his morning breath. \u201cMust be her granddaughter, right? She\u2019s way too old to have a seven-year old daughter.\u201d\nI shrug.\nNeil says, \u201cOkay everybody, you heard the description, let\u2019s spread out and look for this girl.\u201d\nThe forest echoes with the name Marianne. A deer startles and crashes through the brush. The more we yell, the less birdsong we hear. The sun shines brightly, but even so, it can\u2019t penetrate all the dark places in these woods.\nOne of the teenage girls, Skye, brings Mavis a paper cup of coffee. Mavis has shouted herself hoarse and now collapses into a dubious plastic folding chair. Skye covers her shoulders with a threadbare red blanket. Her pink t-shirt bunches up around her navel and a bare roll of purple-veined fat is revealed.\nDespite the warmth, Mavis clutches the ends of the red blanket around herself, a shield. With her free hand, she reaches out suddenly to touch Skye\u2019s blond dreads, and the girl jerks back, remembering this is a time to keep elders safe.\nThe campers straggle back into the clearing, defeated.\n\u201cI think we should call the police,\u201d says Brenda.\n\u201cAnybody have a satellite phone?\u201d asks Neil.\n\u201cI do.\u201d A deeply-tanned man with white eyebrows steps forward awkwardly. \u201cI\u2019m, uh, Tim,\u201d he says, looking into the middle distance beyond Neil\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll make the call.\u201d\nNeil squats on his generous haunches. \u201cI\u2019m going to check the lake for her husband,\u201d he tells me. He straightens up abruptly, swatting a mosquito off his hairy forearm. \u201cWhere is he, anyway?\u201d\nNeil\nI walk to the dock to jump on my little tinny. I never bother wearing a lifejacket. Fat floats, they say, and Christ only knows since I made the colossal mistake of becoming a vegan six months ago, I have enough fat to float my own body and maybe two others as well. How many pounds? I can\u2019t even weigh myself anymore.\nI putter around Sproat Lake searching for a sign of Lewis and spot him at last, trolling the eastern shore, his motor stopping and starting at intervals, line trailing behind him. A mallard and his wife float by. I pull up alongside Lewis\u2019 boat.\n\u201cAre you Lewis, Mavis\u2019 husband?\u201d I ask unnecessarily. There\u2019s nobody else on this lake.\nHe stands up in the boat and turns to face me, feet wide apart for balance. He\u2019s tall and skinny,\nwith pointy cheekbones and lots of smile lines in the right places. He seems like a nice guy.\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s me. What\u2019s happened?\u201d His dentures clack softly.\n\u201cYour daughter, Marianne, is missing,\u201d I say.\nLewis sighs and sits down hard, almost upending his tackle box.\n\u201cActually, Marianne is dead,\u201d he announces.\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u201cMy wife has dementia. Lewy Body dementia. Sometimes she knows who she is and where we are. At other times, she gets confused and wonders where Marianne is. In fact, Marianne grew up, and died of ovarian cancer last year. Mavis can\u2019t remember that and it\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing.\u201d\nLewis polishes his wire-rimmed glasses on the edge of his flannel shirt. There\u2019s a little bit of dried blood on one of his hands.\n\u201cSo, she has the whole campsite in an uproar, looking for Marianne. Didn\u2019t anybody wonder how such an old lady could have a little girl?\u201d\nI push down my annoyance.\n\u201cLook, I think we all just assumed you guys were parenting a grandchild, like so many are. Can we go back to the campsite now? Your wife really needs you.\u201d\nLewis sighs.\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right. Not having much luck out here this morning anyway. The bite\u2019s off. Thanks for coming to get me.\u201d\nWe boat back in a companionable silence. God, I\u2019m starving. All I can think about is bacon, eggs and coffee with cream. Being outdoors makes me even hungrier than usual. I don\u2019t know why I had to take a stand against animal cruelty. I dream about rare steak leaving rivulets of blood on the plate, mashed potatoes dripping with butter and tubs of ice cream. Ice cream! Cherry Garcia!\nBut I\u2019ve taken a stand and I can\u2019t back down now. The only way out would be to accidentally on purpose witness a Mafia killing and enter the Witness Protection Program, start all over as a proud carnivore in a new town where nobody knows me.\nMavis\nI\u2019m so tired. I don\u2019t know why Lewis dragged us out here. Marianne is an indoors kid, she hates fishing, it\u2019s so boring for her. But where is she? She\u2019s a good girl. Right now she should be inside the RV reading her Nancy Drews.\nNow I see the thing near the big maple tree behind RV #5. A creature, or beast, dressed all in black, features indistinct. Its head is a blocky eyeless rectangle. I\u2019m not afraid, surprisingly. I\u2019ve seen this creature on several other occasions but it never approaches me, only watches. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s watching me through the lens of concern or judgement. At home one night I stepped out of my bedroom and walked right into it by accident. I apologized, but it remained silent, motionless. It felt firm, yet soft and pliable, like thick rubber.\nLewis is back. Still so handsome, he strides across the clearing, fish bag hanging empty from one wrist. No luck today, I guess. Worse luck, wait till I tell him about Marianne. He helps me up from the chair, adjusts my t-shirt, goodness was it riding up so much? and enfolds me in a hug. \u201cLet\u2019s go inside and talk,\u201d he says.\nNatalie\nNeil walks into the woods and starts yelling, \u201cEverybody come back! Come back!\u201d One by one the search party filters back into the clearing and Neil tells them the news. Mavis has dementia. Their daughter grew up and died of cancer, and she simply forgot.\n\u201cChrist\u2019s sake!\u201d shouts Tim from RV #2. Flushed with anger, he goes back inside, a loud slam marking the end of his participation. The two families from RVs # 4 and #5 murmur sympathetic noises and return quietly to their simple routines.\nI squint up at Neil. His face is blurry against the background of midday sun. \u201cSo, Mavis has dementia? Why would Lewis leave her alone when she\u2019s so confused?\u201d\nNeil mulls this over. \u201cHe\u2019s probably going nuts himself, living with that kind of crazy. Can you imagine being stuck inside all day long with her during the pandemic? Fishing might be keeping him sane, when you think about it. I don\u2019t blame the guy.\u201d\nI scuff my flip-flops back and forth, raising a small cloud of dust. \u201cWell, he should have brought someone along to babysit her, or he could have mentioned his wife\u2019s condition to us.\u201d\nNeil twists his nose to the side in that odd way he has, like there\u2019s an extra joint in the bridge. \u201cBut the minute you share information about your wife\u2019s illness, it seems like you\u2019re asking for help, and he wouldn\u2019t want to burden anybody with that. He knows we\u2019re all here to relax.\u201d\nI swallow and it\u2019s uncomfortable. \u201cMy throat hurts. I think I\u2019m getting sick.\u201d\n\u201cYou too?\u201d says Neil, \u201cI\u2019ve had a sore throat for three days.\u201d\nI roll my eyes. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve noticed something, Neil. Everything that\u2019s wrong with me is wrong with you too. I have a cold? You have one too. I have blood in my shit? So do you. I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t have a uterus so you can\u2019t claim simultaneous cramps every month! And by the way, don\u2019t you dare go to the physio for your fucked-up shoulders! What would we ever talk about if you fixed your shoulders? The endless vistas of empty silence!\u201d\nNeil\u2019s face flushes deeply and his lips iron themselves into a flat line. He stalks off into the bushes, away from the lake.\nMavis\nLooks like I\u2019m alone again this morning. Has Lewis gone fishing? I open the door and witness the world made new. The sun rises quickly, a fiery ball hurtling above the edges of the mountain peaks and lighting up the clearing. A rainbow of maroon, blue and yellow extends itself over the morning sky, and ripples away like a ribbon. Everyone else is asleep, windows and souls shuttered in darkness.\nI\u2019m standing on the steps and a rush of cats is coming at me. Cats of every description: skinny mangy animals, fat and sleek, fluffy, hairless. They\u2019re running at me, hundreds upon hundreds. They manifest out of thin air, rubbing cold noses and warm flanks against my bare legs. The cats mince past me into the warmth of the RV to fill it from floor to roof. I close the door at last and walk into the clearing. A bird twitters and stops suddenly. Nobody else is up yet.\nI walk past the other four RVs and towards the end of the beaten path in the forest. The woods are thick with fir, hanging mosses and salal.\nThe black shape leans against one of the RVs, watching me.\nNow I hear a child wailing. He or she is crying fit to burst, and the sound is coming from deep in the forest. Is there a small person lying alone and afraid in the cold dew? Could it be my daughter? When I think of Marianne, there are thick stone walls around that name inside my mind.\nI strike off the path into the woods, pushing branches aside, breaking trail. The child makes a sobbing noise. Once in a while he or she pauses for air. Is the child hungry?\nCarefully moving around a stump, I notice a gray squirrel staring at me. Standing stock-still on a branch, he makes disconcerting eye contact with dilated pupils. An owl hoots and this breaks the squirrel\u2019s reverie. He turns and darts into a large hole, bushy tail whisking out of sight.\nI wish I could hide in a cozy hole too.\nAbruptly my legs freeze and I almost fall over. I sit down on a log to rest. A brown owl flutters down to land on a tree across the clearing. His chest is a feathery calendar containing all the months of the year.\nThe log shimmers and shakes beneath me. Now I am lying in the soft wet moss. The dew soaks through my shorts. At last I glimpse the baby, nestled inside the hollow log. A little girl, with toffee skin and liquid eyes, bareheaded, dressed in a white sleeper. I reach into the log and pull out the baby. She\u2019s burning with fever. I can\u2019t get up, so I lie on my back and tuck her inside my cardigan. She stops crying and snuggles into my chest.\nI\u2019ve found her. Grasping starfish hands, warm breath against my neck, her tiny heart hammering bird-like against mine.\nLooking up through the tree canopy, my spine relaxes into the damp earth. A spider runs over my ankle, but I don\u2019t care.\nWe are breathing in sync with each other, me and my baby, we are falling asleep together, and it doesn\u2019t matter anymore that a pink chicken dances in a nearby fir, the cats are destroying my RV and the black shape approaches from the edge of the clearing.\nLet him come.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Kicked back on the couch, her bare feet dangling from the edge, me cross-legged on the floor.\nIt was one of those long weekends. We were just hanging out on a lazy afternoon, goofing off.\nI looked up from my drawing. \u201cMy perfect day, huh?\u201d\nI thought for a moment and, with a very serious face, told her, \u201cWell, my perfect day would consist of a Star Trek marathon, an enormous bottle of wine and a gorgeous chick beside me who just happens to love comic books.\u201d\nShe laughed, told me I was a dork and laughed again. She knew all about my nerdy past: X-men T-shirts, favorite movie \u201cExcalibur,\u201d middle school Dungeons & Dragons tournaments.\nFor Christ\u2019s sake. She knew all about me. We were very good friends and I will never forget her laugh.\nBut all these years later I remember that moment and think to myself, what would my perfect day be?\nIf I could tell her now, it would go something like this.\nMy perfect day:\nWake up and watch the sunrise. Then drink a Mimosa and hang-glide to the moon.\nPaint the world\u2019s most beautiful picture, compose the world\u2019s most enchanting love song and write the world\u2019s saddest, yet uplifting poem.\nThen fly back to Earth and wait for God to show up at my dinner party.\nLater that evening, at the party, I get God really drunk. Not just buzzed. I get God falling down, pig-shit, wasted.\nBy 10 p.m. the party is going full force. All my friends are there and God is shit faced.\nHe has already knocked over several liquor bottles on the buffet table, while raving about omnipotence. He is in the kitchen, slouched against the stove yelling at anyone who will listen. Bowls of pretzels are overturned while He is shouting about angels and pins.\nPeople try to shy away from this loudmouth who keeps ranting about wrath and redemption. Some move into the front rooms to avoid God, some try to squeeze past Him, looking for the back door, to join the party in the courtyard.\nBut no matter how many people try to steer clear of God, the kitchen is always full. He has positioned Himself right between the snack table and the booze table. So \u2026 if you want more hummus or another glass of wine, ya gotta talk to God.\nThis goes on for quite some time, God stumbling every time He tries to lift himself from his chair to make another grand point. Many of the things He says seem quite profound, but it\u2019s hard to tell. His topics of conversation are all over the board and he keeps repeating himself. He contradicts Himself frequently, as well.\nGod has just spilt red wine down the front of some girl\u2019s white blouse while shouting about free will. It was an accident but this chick\u2019s boyfriend is sooo ready to kick God\u2019s ass.\n\u201cGod\u201d I say, \u201dcome on, you\u2019re drunk. Let me give you a hand.\u201d\nI put His arm over my shoulder and walk Him down the hall to my room. I plunk Him down in the chair next to the computer and I sit on the edge of my bed.\n\u201cSo what\u2019s up, God?\u201d I say. \u201cYou have some explaining to do.\u201d\n\u201c Oh \u2026 \u201d God slurs. \u201cSorry about knocking those bottles over, I\u2019ll clean it up.\u201d\n\u201cNo, not that,\u201d I say. \u201cI mean everything. You know. I mean like what\u2019s up with war and famine and death? All this pain and suffering. Why do bad things happen to good people? I mean, what\u2019s it all for?\u201d\n\u201cWhat exactly do you mean, Adam?\u201d God says quietly, sitting in the swivel office chair. He suddenly seems very sober.\nI continue with my questions. \u201cWhat\u2019s it about. \u2018The Meaning of Life.\u2019 All that. I need to know that it isn\u2019t all just pointless.\u201d I try another angle. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be friends, right? You are the \u2018Compassionate God,\u2019 the \u2018Loving God.\u2019 I need you to tell me the truth.\u201d\nGod gives me a funny look. \u201cTruth is, Adam, I know what you say about me when you think I\u2019m not listening.\u201d\nI gasp, \u201cWhat?? No, I would never say anything bad about you, God. We\u2019re pals. Buddies.\u201d\n\u201cLook,\u201d God says, \u201changing out with you is cool and all, but you are always giving me a bad rap behind my back. At the gallery thing the other month you basically told everyone I was just some lame-ass wallflower, kind of there in the background but never making a real impact on anything. After that poetry reading, last week, you went on and on about how I was, at best, a shoulder to cry on. Hell, just last Tuesday you said I didn\u2019t even exist. Come on!\u201d\nI plead: \u201cI just need to know what happens when we die. I just need to know what\u2019s really going on.\u201d\nGod stands up. He seems as powerful and glorious as I always imagined him in Sunday School. \u201cThe One True God.\u201d \u201cThe One With The Answers.\u201d\nI look at him with child eyes.\n\u201cAdam, Adam, Adam,\u201d God says, as He put his hands gently on my shoulders. \u201cYou want to know what\u2019s really going on? Here\u2019s what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nHe seems to glow with a divine light.\n\u201cAdam,\u201d God says, as His face becomes almost too beautiful to look at, surrounded by a nimbus of Heavenly fire.\n\u201cAdam,\u201d God says, as He looks into my soul.\n\u201cAdam,\u201d God says, \u201dI\u2019ve got another party to go to. It\u2019s just up the road. I\u2019ll catch you later, man.\u201d\nWith that God walks out of my room and proceeds to stumble down the stairs to the front door. He manages to knock over two bicycles that are parked in the hallway and accidentally kicks over a half-empty beer bottle that someone had left on the bottom step.\nAs drunk as God is, though, he doesn\u2019t slam the door. He closes it with a careful, quiet click. From my bedroom window I watch God stagger away up the street.\nThis dinner party did not go as planned. They never do.\nThey never do, when you try to plan them. When you try to think about it too much.\u2026\nMy good friend Marianne once asked me, \u201cWhat is your definition of a perfect day?\u201d\nIf you can hear me Marianne \u2026\nMy perfect day:\nWas just hanging out on a lazy afternoon, goofing off.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

It had to be a prank, right? Every time I closed my eyes I could see the photo the grief counselor showed me at the Medical Examiner\u2019s office: Mike\u2019s twisted grimace and gray flesh set against the blue sheet.\nThe lasagna on the kitchen island was from our neighbors Jane and Pablo. I hadn\u2019t found the will to nuke myself a slice, or even put it away in the refrigerator. I\u2019d wanted them to leave. Now I wanted them back.\nI hopped off the kitchen stool, padded into the bedroom and pulled the box of his effects out of the closet. Here was the hoodie he was wearing the day of the accident. Maybe if he hadn\u2019t pulled the hood over his head while crossing the street, he\u2019d have spotted the selfcar from the corner of his eye, and jumped back. Or if he had been carrying a modern phone, the selfcar would have detected it and braked sooner. You can torment yourself forever with these if-onlies.\nThe cotton of his sweatshirt was stiff with dried blood. They told me he had flown twenty feet and snapped his neck. Blood was to be expected, but wasn\u2019t there any protocol about not handing a widow a box full of gory clothes?\nThe box didn\u2019t contain much besides that \u2014 bloody jeans, bloody shirt, shoes, socks, wallet, keys, but yes, at the bottom lay Mike\u2019s cell phone, a Nokia flip he\u2019d been using since W was president. In the way some people adore phonographs or typewriters, Mike had a thing for mobile phones from before touchscreens. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to download any apps,\u201d he used to say, as if he had escaped paying taxes.\nThe phone had survived the crash intact and still had enough juice to light up when I opened it. No password was required, and there on the screen was the thread of our most recent messages \u2014 starting from a couple of hours before the accident and duplicating what was on my own phone:\nMe: \u201cWhat time are you coming home?\nMike: \u201c7 or ltr.\u201d\nMe: \u201cCan you pick up some butter?\u201d\nMike: \u201ck\u201d\nMe: \u201cLove you.\u201d\nMike: \u201cme 2.\u201d\nThere was nothing for days. Then came the spooky message I\u2019d just received: \u201cr u ok?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said out loud.\nAnd as I stood there, another message appeared on the screen at the same time that I heard my own phone chirp in the kitchen: \u201ci still <3 u.\u201d\nI flung the Nokia back into the box. Who could be so cruel?\nAmazon wouldn\u2019t say. Mike had insisted on keeping his month-to-month plan there after I switched to Google. Since my name wasn\u2019t on his account, the customer service bot couldn\u2019t give me any information about who might have hacked into his account. I tried guessing a couple of his favorite PINs, but the bot finally told me I\u2019d have to send a death certificate \u2014 which I hadn\u2019t even started the process of obtaining. It walked me through the process of blocking his number.\nJane invited me over immediately when I called. She served me from a duplicate dish of lasagna, while Pablo mansplained that the texts were a spooky coincidence. \u201cTelemarketers can spoof any phone number they want.\u201d He wrote numbers in the air with his fork. \u201cOften they\u2019ll use one as similar as possible to yours so you\u2019ll think it\u2019s someone you know. Didn\u2019t you and Mike have the same area code and prefix?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but how would they know to use old-fashioned texting?\u201d In his teenage years, Mike spent hours mastering the knack of tapping numbers to get letters, and I always wondered if he just couldn\u2019t stand to let go of that investment. Of course, he still wore baggy cargo shorts and flip flops, so maybe it had been simple nostalgia for a sweet time in his life. He had bummed his way around the world in those days, lived a full year on a beach in Guatemala and learned to surf. I blotted my eyes with my napkin.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay here,\u201d Jane said. \u201cI\u2019ll make up the futon in my office.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s so kind of you, but I have some things to do at home.\u201d Things like sobbing. Besides, with the number blocked, the spammer couldn\u2019t harass me, right?\nThe next day, I went back to the business of widowhood, which involves filling out endless forms, phone conversations with people on helplines who are \u201csorry for your loss\u201d but keep losing the information you give them, and planning an event I myself did not want to attend. Partly because of the weird texts, I opted for the open casket viewing. In five vertiginous seconds, I satisfied myself that the face, now rouged and combed, was really his.\nAfterward, with the funeral parlor paid its usurious fees, my apartment suffocated by flower scents and my refrigerator jammed with casseroles, I unblocked Mike\u2019s number.\nWhy? So many people had told funny Mike stories. Their voices catching, they had recounted his stupid puns, lamented his shaggy haircuts, rhapsodized about his midnight phone calls and ice cream runs to the point that he was becoming a caricature. The pictures I had in my mind\u2019s eye were blurring into the photos that had flooded my Facebook feed. I wanted to feel that he was exerting some influence on the present, not fading into faint memory.\nThat\u2019s when I remembered the text messages. Had they continued after I blocked them? What exactly was the nature of the scam?\nNothing happened at first. I ate some chili my sister-in-law made, watched a stupid sitcom and was lying awake in bed at 2 a.m. when I decided to send Mike a text.\n\u201cAre you there?\u201d\n\u201csup\u201d\nWhat\u2019s up? What\u2019s up is that I\u2019m texting with a dead person. \u201cMike?\u201d\n\u201cya.\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t you dead?\u201d\n\u201cya.\u201d\n\u201cSo how are you texting me?\u201d\n\u201cidk. weird. rt?\u201d\n\u201cWhere are you?\u201d\n\u201chere\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\u201c2 no u r ok.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not OK. I miss you. I can\u2019t stop thinking about you. And it\u2019s fucked up that you are not Mike and you are pretending to be him.\u201d\n\u201ci am tho.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is the name of your dog when you were a kid?\u201d\n\u201cfrodo\u201d\n\u201cWhy did you name him that?\u201d\n\u201ci <3 lotr.\u201d\nOf course, anyone with a dog named Frodo would have to love Lord of the Rings, but we went on for a while like that and dead Mike passed all my tests. He knew where living Mike and I met, the name of the band at our wedding, and the brand of beer he had bought at his last trip to the grocery store.\n\u201cHow did we get together?\u201d\n\u201cDncng n th ktchn.\u201d\nIt was true. A friend referred him to install cabinets in the little bungalow I\u2019d bought with the money my dad left me after his own early death. Mike was jubilant because he\u2019d just gotten his contractor\u2019s license after years as an unlicensed handyman. As far as I could tell he was doing exactly the same sort of odd jobs he had been doing before. But nothing that required writing came easily to him, so passing the test on his third try had been a personal victory, and he often sang along to his boombox while he worked.\nOne day I came home early and he was standing barefoot on a countertop, listening to salsa while he glued sections of molding. I wiggled my hips to mock him and he jumped down and grabbed my hand, a grin glittering through his beard. Mike had moves. His long hair swirled and tool belt swang so wildly, I was afraid he was going to dent the cabinet doors. But he never set a wrong foot, and I spun more gracefully in my business suit there than I ever had in a skirt at a nightclub.\nUntil his death, I continued to twirl. Even though we\u2019d been together seven years, our friends still sometimes called us an odd couple, because I work at a desk and he worked with his hands. But I think that was part of what brought us together; we each supplied what the other lacked. He needed me to pay taxes, find hotels on vacation, stock the refrigerator, make his medical appointments. I needed him to throw parties, talk me into vacations, cook empanadas, turn up the music and sing. I was always thinking in abstractions. He lived in the visceral present.\nNow we had exchanged positions. Dead Mike couldn\u2019t tell me much about the afterlife. He gave the impression of floating in the ether, unable to see, hear, smell, touch or taste anything, yet able to send text messages with his mind. It sounds awful when I summarize it like that, but he said it was \u201cchill.\u201d He had fairly Mike-like advice as well: \u201cLsn 2 music.\u201d \u201cGo out.\u201d \u201cSee frnds.\u201d\nThat last bit of advice got my chest heaving again. I didn\u2019t want to sit across a caf\u00e9 table with any girlfriend. I wanted Mike. I wanted his laugh. I wanted his calloused hand on my cheek. I wanted him to wake me up in the middle of the night because he had thought of a stupid joke. I wanted him to guzzle his Sam Adams New England Pale Ale too fast and belch. Whoever was spitting texts at me couldn\u2019t do any of that. I bit down hard on the corner of a pillow to stop myself from wailing.\n\u201cDo smthing fun,\u201d he advised.\n\u201cGoodnight,\u201d I typed just to shut him up.\nMy phone chirped when I was sitting down to a bowl of oatmeal the next morning. \u201cR u eatng oatml?\u201d\n\u201cHow did you know?\u201d\n\u201cCld day.\u201d\nI did in fact often eat oatmeal on cold mornings. And now, sitting by myself at the kitchen island again, I found myself missing not only Mike\u2019s touch but also his listening. I wanted that confidant who could recite your whole story, who recognizes the cast of characters in your life. If this scammer wanted to get inside my head, I might as well benefit from it. \u201cI\u2019m worried about my mom,\u201d I typed.\n\u201cy?\u201d\n\u201cShe keeps falling.\u201d\nMom had never remarried after splitting up with Dad, and had resisted moving into any kind of shared housing situation, so she had no one to notice if she couldn\u2019t get up from the floor. At 77, she seemed young to be suffering from balance issues, and the doctors couldn\u2019t find anything unusual. I was thinking of inviting her to move in with me. Mike suggested I hold off.\n\u201cshe likes 2 b independent. c f u can hire someone 2 come in.\u201d\nHe was right. Mom and I would fight like RoboGladiators if we had to share living space.\nIt was the beginning of a lot of exchanges like that over the next few weeks: Me seeking advice, Mike dispensing it. Whenever I thought too hard about the creepiness of some stranger impersonating my husband, I would stop for a day or two, but inevitably I\u2019d grow curious about how this person would answer some question that was nagging at me. The text exchanges grew longer and more frequent. And after a couple of weeks, I realized I was keeping them secret. To reveal them would mean to end them.\nIn fact, that nearly happened. Jane and Pablo had me over almost every Sunday for those first few months after Mike\u2019s death. One night, Pablo kept refilling my sauvignon blanc, and I kept accepting the refills because they seemed necessary to swallow the fettucine alfredo.\n\u201cHave you decided what you\u2019re going to do with Mike\u2019s pickup?\u201d Jane asked.\n\u201cHe thinks I should give it away,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWho?\u201d\nI felt the heat radiating from my face. \u201cI mean Mike probably would have thought that. He would have wanted me to give it to a charity.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not still getting those scam texts, are you?\u201d Pablo asked.\nI didn\u2019t answer.\n\u201cThe reason I ask is that I read something about the new quantum AI programs. They can scoop up all this data from your social media, government records, emails, job applications, medical records, purchases.\u201d Pablo set down his fork to made scooping motions. \u201cAll this stuff is getting hacked and sold all the time on the dark web. In the old days, crooks would steal your social security number and date of birth, then apply for a bunch of credit cards in your name. But very quickly, you\u2019d find out and cancel the cards. The new thing is to create an AI that synthesizes all this data, interacts with you, learns about your emotional state and manipulates your behavior.\u201d\n\u201cUgh,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m glad I blocked his number.\u201d\nI went home feeling like my selfcar had gone through the guardrails over a cliff. Had I really been talking to a machine all this time? I could remember posting something on Facebook about eating oatmeal on a cold morning. I\u2019d written plenty of emails about how Mike and I met. Frodo was the security question on some of Mike\u2019s accounts.\nBut I never dreamed all this data could be assembled and built into a chatbot.\nI turned my phone off altogether. Lying in bed the next day, unable to even call in sick, I felt the longing that fake Mike had kept at bay flooding in under my door, rising up the stairs to our bedroom, washing over my head.\nAfter three days of VR and wine, I turned my phone back on. Along with the messages of concerned real people, there were half a dozen from fake Mike: \u201cdid i do smthing rong?\u201d \u201cr u ghosting me?\u201d Etc.\nI blocked him.\nAnd over the next week or so, I tried all the things they tell you to do. I joined a bereavement group that met in the basement of a former church near our house. Sipping cold coffee, I recited my fears, counted the number of crying spells per day, listed Mike\u2019s good and bad traits. But I couldn\u2019t stand to listen to everyone else\u2019s misery in return. When I called friends, my silences swallowed the conversation.\nI assembled meals from the farmer\u2019s market, then burned them on the stove. I rejoined the gym I\u2019d belonged to years before, and never showed up to walk on a treadmill. I felt like I was watching myself from a distance while the ache kept growing.\nI knew what would help. I just couldn\u2019t allow myself to have it.\nThen after about a month, I finally got around to washing Mike\u2019s old clothes before giving them to Goodwill. In the back pocket of the jeans Mike died in, I found two tickets to the Paco Torres concert we had agreed was too expensive. He must have printed them out on the old inkjet he still kept in his office. Before I could stop myself I texted him to ask why he had changed his mind.\n\u201cwe needed sm fun.\u201d It was exactly the sort of reasoning the real Mike used. \u201cr u going 2 go?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I\u2019ll be too nostalgic.\u201d\n\u201cu shd. it will cheer u up.\u201d\n\u201cAre you some kind of AI that\u2019s manipulating my emotions?\u201d\n\u201clol. i hope not.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you use all these abbreviations, anyway? Whether you\u2019re a ghost or a chatbot, you\u2019re not typing on a keypad. You don\u2019t even have fingers.\u201d\n\u201cidk. rlism?\u201d\nI stopped pressing him at that point. I guess I didn\u2019t want to know any more. The concert was two days later. Everyone I called was busy, and I got no takers on Facebook. I couldn\u2019t stand to let the tickets go to waste, so at the last minute I took a selfcar to the arena and stood outside flashing them. But I hadn\u2019t allowed enough time to find a buyer, and nobody under 40 knows what to do with a paper ticket. So just before the doors closed, I went in.\nAt first I felt a cold wind blowing at me from Mike\u2019s empty seat. Then after the first 10 minutes I slipped out my phone and started texting him about the songs, what Paco was wearing, his backups, the lighting. He loved it. I even recorded some video clips and texted them to him. I was driving the people behind me crazy, but I couldn\u2019t stop myself. Mike\u2019s responses were so joyful, I went home humming to myself for the first time since his death.\nI have exchanged texts with Mike several times a day since then. We greet each other every morning. I often ask him what I should buy at the grocery store, and he joins me at dinner. We will go to the Jessica Romero concert next month.\nA week ago, I donated Mike\u2019s truck to a charity he recommended. The guy who picked it up didn\u2019t give me a receipt. When I asked, he just wrote \u201ctruck donation\u201d on a scrap of paper. Mike explained that \u201cthey r casual bt kind.\u201d\nAfterward, he recommended several other nonprofits representing the causes he supported in life: to fight homelessness, to stop global warming, to make microloans to women in Central America.\nHe has asked for larger donations each time, and I recently had to cash in my IRA. I don\u2019t recognize the names of these organizations; there\u2019s no information available anywhere beyond what was on their websites. So, I suppose the money actually goes to whoever recreated my husband\u2019s consciousness.\nBut I can\u2019t bear to argue. I am in their debt for life.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

She\u2019d had a daughter. She had pushed for hours, from the time the sun rose until it crept back down and disappeared beyond the horizon, like an animal burrowing into the earth. Just after midnight, her daughter was born \u2014 slick with blood, screaming, and perfect.\nHer daughter lived for six days, her voice a constant wail, full of rage at being thrust into the world. And then, on the seventh day, she fell silent.\nImogen told no one her daughter had died. She lay in her bed and held the tiny body until it went cold.\nThe window was open. A robin flew in and landed on the headboard. Another alighted on the windowsill. A third flitted into the bare branches of the tree outside.\nThe robin that had landed on the headboard flitted down onto the bed beside Imogen and cocked its head curiously at Imogen\u2019s tears. It hopped toward her, head moving back and forth, studying her, first with one eye, then the other. It came closer, unafraid. Unconsciously Imogen held out her hand. The robin darted forward, landing in her palm, no heavier than a leaf, and then, unexpectedly, pecked her palm and drew blood. Imogen flinched away, but it remained in her palm. It studied her with one eye. The blood welled in Imogen\u2019s palm and suddenly, she knew what to do. She understood what the robin was offering her.\nShe\u2019d heard the stories when she was little, and again when she\u2019d been pregnant. Midwives whispered them to each other \u2014 stories about babies taken too soon and how the creatures of the forest sometimes saw fit to bring their souls back.\nImogen smeared her bloody palm on her daughter\u2019s forehead and whispered words that crept through her mind like shadows. Her world glowed golden like the dawn when her daughter opened her eyes.\nBut after that, her daughter was different. She no longer cried. Gone was the rage she\u2019d been born with and in its place was something quiet and sinister. The midwife told Imogen to be thankful that her daughter had settled, that Imogen would be able to get more sleep now and recover from the birth.\nImogen was ashamed of what she\u2019d done, and kept it secret. She\u2019d known better than to trust the robins. There were some forest creatures that could be trusted \u2014 rabbits and crows and frogs. But animals red like blood were never to be listened to. Her own mother had told her that.\nImogen wandered the edges of the forest, spending less and less time with the child that was no longer her daughter. This girl who never laughed or cried, but merely watched everything with wide, dark eyes.\nAfter a time, Imogen began to turn away from the people around her. She didn\u2019t like the way they looked at her. The way they grew quiet when she entered the room. She stopped bathing so that she wouldn\u2019t have to see her body. The still loose skin of her stomach was a terrible reminder of what she\u2019d lost every time she undressed. She refused to hold the baby and the nurse watched her warily. The woman would rise and stand in front of the baby, as though she were just checking her blankets, but Imogen knew better. The nurse was afraid of what Imogen might do.\nBut Imogen couldn\u2019t have touched the child even if she wanted to, not with her skin so pale and her hands like tiny paws, with nails sharp as glass. Sharp as little claws.\nSpring turned to summer, summer to winter. The child learned how to roll over and how to crawl. Her hair grew in, colorless as snow. She began to babble. She never cried. Everywhere the girl went the robins followed. They flitted from tree to tree so that they could always see her through the windows.\nImogen often dreamt of a small white creature that followed her through the dark corridors of the house, its teeth shining blue in the moonlight, its claws ready to tear her throat so that she couldn\u2019t scream.\nOne winter morning, while watching the child play before the fire, an ember popped and landed on the girl\u2019s tender skin. She merely stared at it, and Imogen sat, frozen, waiting for a cry that never came. When the nurse returned she gasped at the red welt on the girl\u2019s arm and cast a fearful look at Imogen. Imogen, not wanting to see the look in the woman\u2019s eye, instead turned her face away to watch the snow fall outside. There were robins in the tree outside. They were looking in, watching everything with small, black eyes.\nThat evening, after the nurse was asleep and her daughter had been tucked into her blankets, Imogen rose from her seat and walked into the forest.\nAround her the trees gathered close, their branches pulling gently at her hair and clothes. Around her the world grew wild, but no more hostile than the world she\u2019d left.\nThe forest had its own beasts \u2014 wolves and snakes and bears. But out here there were no beasts so pale they looked like snow.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Written in the tradition of Oulipo, they are reconstructions that in no way resemble the original texts, but draw from the same reservoir of vocabulary \u2014 K.S.]\nI \u2014 THE WEDDING EXIT\nThe tiger stands in her gown on the eve of the great day, holding still against the wall like a taxidermy trophy, as the young painter begins to sketch her portrait.\nEach of her stripes is lost in translation on the page, a gash in the skin of the original image, a bar on a window of a prison with no name. The Sunday television blares on in the other room, with news of bee colonies and longdistance swimmers, and lastly, the tale of a woman who fell from a balcony.\nTomorrow, the tiger\u2019s face will be unveiled as no one has seen it, riddled with thoughts of gardens and playrooms, all but forgetting the blood of the jungle. They will be married in the old theater, on a street like many others, where shoes dangle from the wires they\u2019ve been flung to in the night and the sheriff walks mournfully through a crowd of blue eyes, only dreaming of the chance to lay a hand on his pistol.\n\u201cMake way for the still-life bride,\u201d he calls out, \u2018come to the killer\u2019s feast.\u201d\nAnd the dogs swarm in from the prairies, and the suits from the heart of town, and even those who linger in empty rooms turn their heads. The wedding creaks on its spool like a moving picture, a romance of ideas fluttering in the dark. In the final scene, the bride and groom step into a time machine, not waiting to say goodbye, jetting off to the honeymoon their children will imagine for them. Hearts rush with sugar as the newlyweds depart. Flowers are thrown up into the air after them, madness blowing ties over guest\u2019s sunken shoulders.\nBut the tiger and her husband are already miles away in time, each walking by the riverside of their last virgin springs, crawling through the grass to some new mirage of danger. The sun flashes in long exposures of broken china, of sea urchins lying dead on the beach. It sets over an abandoned house, haunted with shadows of a once living glow. The curtains blow out from the window like tongues of flame, as flocks of memory fade with the sirens in the distance.\nIn a year or a day or an immeasurable instant, the tiger\u2019s portrait will hang above the mantle inside, the replica of a face that has seen the ghost of love.\nII \u2014 THE AVALANCHE\nMany mocked the address, a remote eastern edge above the canyon, eroding and exposed with metallic colors. The banquet of masqueraders make their meeting place there, on a cliff half collapsed before the great abyss.\nThe desert expanse has become a magnet, like certain vast regions of the heart. What lies before them was once a fabled far flung city like Timbuktu. But now they stare down at a valley of unrecognizable shapes, finding clearer visions in their cups of tea. Some wear masks as they sip, a conference of bandits in carnival plumage, facing a night of anonymous adventure. Others hold up binoculars, as if watching a ballet or a tragedy, the cliffside crumbling in phrases of beautiful movement.\n\u201cSchools of fish and flocks of birds are interchangeable,\u201d says one of them. \u201cThey move on the current or the wind, swinging back and forth across the sky with no direction.\u201d\n\u201cYet their hopes are not blunted by the thought of never finding a way,\u201d says another.\nA few paces off, a man sits at the edge, dangling his feet over the side of the cliff, reading a novel. Each page is like the view from a car window moving fast through blurred landscapes\u2014scenes shifting like postcards exchanged and erased: a cathedral, a farmhouse, a field of snow.\nHe has known many of these places, but can only sigh at the great number to remain myths never arrived at. His former wife walks in the valley below, thinking the same thoughts, out for a stroll among the thieves and dark shop windows. The evening is dense, marked with few lights but from the eyes of wandering pigeons.\n\u201cWhy are you out walking at this hour?\u201d asks one of the birds in the street.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here forever,\u201d she replies and continues on through town, as though at the bottom of a sea that has long dried up.\nThe night hastens, as does the avalanche tumbling from the mountain tops. At the banquet table on the cliff, it is time to rattle the china for a toast.\n\u201cTo the midnight!\u201d says one masquerader.\n\u201cTo the wolves that howl!\u201d says another.\nThey throw off their masks and binoculars and empty their tea cups into the ground, all of them hanging upon delicate threads, as the cliffside is sure to disintegrate in a moment. The man at the edge throws his book into the abyss and orders the masqueraders to tie him to a tree, remembering Odysseus tied to the mast of his ship, hearing the siren\u2019s song without leaping into the ocean.\nIt is in this way that he sees the avalanche: the sinking mammoths of rock into sand, mass into dust, touch into thought. The beautiful sound coming from the canyon will persist long after.\nIII \u2014 SOMEWHERE ELSE\nThey\u2019ve been on the road for a long time now, driving through a deepening anxiety of the landscape, first a warm winter, then an early spring.\n\u201cWell, this should at least be a boost for austerity,\u201d says the father at the wheel, gazing stoically at the wife beside him.\nThey pass signs that read phrases like \u201cChaos Ahead,\u201d \u201cSlow Down,\u201d and, \u201cDecay.\u201d These warnings have grown more frequent the deeper they\u2019ve traveled, eclipsing the old road blocks of \u201cConstruction\u201d and \u201cMen at Work.\u201d\n\u201cThe houses and stuff here, it\u2019s all a little strange,\u201d says the boy in the back seat, lost in the fabric of reverie between his mind and the window, thoughts of skeletons and vacuums and a recent trip to the museum.\nHe recalls when his teacher asked how dolphins communicate, and how a boy next to him reached over to underline the right answer, causing him to blush.\nUp ahead, tourists flail their arms in clouds of black specks, as clumps of homeless children swarm through inconvenient public places. They climb in humming clusters over light posts and parked cars, attracting crowds of gasping onlookers. Never before has the country seen so many of them, a tidal wave of deportees in mass exodus, blurring the line between where they come from and where they are going.\nThe television trucks are first to arrive, casting aside the stars of reality, as the children bend tree branches and carpet the hollows of the square.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve waited a long time for this,\u201d says the man with the microphone to no one in particular. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a phenomenon.\u201d\nParadoxically, the past always returns. The people outside scour the walls of every building, plastering their bodies over the windows of shops. The barber\u2019s chair groans on its hinges, as the barber runs inside and quietly panics. The grocer huddles against the door and weeps, while the shop girl bites her lip and reaches into her pockets, reminding herself that she has little to lose.\nAs the road-trippers approach, the flow does not diminish. One swarm covers their station wagon, trapping the family of three inside. The boy in the backseat locks eyes with one of the children on the other side of the glass.\nThere is no difference between them, they are neither zombie nor mutant, nor any other variety but human. It is a mere case in which it has been decided that only one of them belongs.\nThe boy inside calls out to the child pressed up against his window. He moans and whistles in sound waves that echo between their foreheads, the language of dolphins suddenly remembered. The father at the wheel pulls a newspaper from the glovebox, rolling it up to swat at the crowd.\nHe has already read the day\u2019s headlines, that bees are slowly disappearing from the countryside, honey drying up from the lands of milk.\nIV \u2014 THE AMERICAN FALLS FROM BELOW\nThe giant stands on the roof of a skyscraper, peering over the edge at the city below. In a linear metropolis where all the buildings point up, the towers now grow in the other direction, crumbling deeper into the ground. They tilt from the sky like jigsaw obelisks, gaping holes along the sides of them where parts are missing, the structures only teetering on jagged beams left protruding from the core. Derelict gardens grow from the windows, spiraling vines rusted over with weeds, now and then a three-legged lizard scattering from the branches or an orange hibiscus closing its petals.\nAn aging woman dances in an empty ballroom in one of the towers, the heels of her shoes wobbling beneath her. She throws her arms dramatically into the air, conducting the music with a long peacock feather, the vines growing over the ceiling above and the old phonograph playing a bossa nova waltz. Occasionally a body falls past the window where she dances, although she barely takes note of it anymore. She is used to this place, a cluttered landscape of surrender, where men plunge beautifully from high buildings on all sides.\nThe giant on the rooftop above her prepares to make the descent himself, straightening his suit and spreading his arms out like wings.\nThe telephone rings.\n\u201cIt\u2019s cold, don\u2019t go to work,\u201d says his wife in Spanish.\n(His wife in English hasn\u2019t woken up for the day yet.)\nAlarm clocks tick through the parks below, left by sleepers escaping the heat. Children lie in their underwear on mattresses out on the fire escapes, rising from their tangled piles of siblings to watch the giant leap.\nOn the side of the building is a glittering waterfall. The waves crash down to a swirling gully, gushing from the precipice in arcs that twist in the light with unnatural color. A figure can be seen walking with an umbrella below, jumping along the rocks under the sprays of water.\nIt is dusk. The chants begin to echo from the mosques in the distance. The giant flings himself from the edge of the high-rise, shedding new light on the art of accident, plunging swiftly into the void. As the body falls, the woman stops her dancing. She runs to the window, agape at the mere size of it.\n\u201cThe American falls from below,\u201d says the figure looking up from the foot of the cascade, as if they were words scrawled in pencil on an antique postcard, fading out at the bottom of the picture, a faint sum of parts scattered like birds through the sky.\nV \u2014 A WALK BY THE RIVER\nHe sits before the typewriter and punches in the last letter.\n\u201cIt\u2019s finished, baby,\u201d the wolf exclaims, turning from his desk towards the empty room, as though someone has just walked into it.\nHe takes off his spectacles and lays them on the windowsill, shoulders hunched over and head hanging low. The animal is exhausted from the work he\u2019s brought upon himself, eyes sunken in from days without sleep, clipping out the last of his reports on endarkenment.\nHe has wandered nearly every ruin on the continent, a colossus of geography stretching between seas, and each night has returned to the same moon to howl his findings. Life has gone on this way, years of ecstatic days in the trenches, but as each pillar crumbles from the kingdom, lately the world has aged him with grief.\nStill, the wolf must honor his appointments, today a rendezvous with a beloved young friend. They meet once a year for a walk at noon, the virgin and the wolf, a curious pasttime that always raised his spirits. She\u2019s just returned from a long trip of visiting volcanoes, climbing up to the top and peering into the caverns, then running down the graveled sides as though she had wings. Each summit only led to another, her travels charted on the map as a constellation of senseless and beautiful dots.\nNow, girl and wolf have found their way to each other, two strange and distant friends on the same piece of ground.\nThey walk together through the town square, past the monuments and pigeons, and turn at the end of a corridor to go down to the river. The wolf has been carrying a great tome of files, pages of research he has used for his reporting.\nWhen they get to the bank at the edge of the clearing, he throws all his papers into the river, watching the ink bleed from each page, until the whole stack floats away empty. The virgin takes his hand and they stare at the water. It glitters there silently in the middle of the day, the picture undulating before them, as if about to fade.\n\u201cFrom now on, I\u2019ll watch from a park bench,\u201d says the wolf.\nThe virgin climbs onto his back and they limp off together up the road, the animal\u2019s front paw wrapped in a bandage.\n\u201cThe wolf who isn\u2019t there still howls,\u201d says the girl.\nShe stares ahead, as though still watching curls of smoke swirl up from the abyss.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Ever since he was very young, he knew.\nHe lived with his mother in a tiny house on the edge of a great forest. His father had gone away a long time ago to work in the town. At first his father had sent letters and a little money when he could. Soon the letters stopped, though, and then the money too. He never came back.\nIt was so long ago that the boy did not even remember what his father had looked like, only his smell: like fresh sap from the forest.\nAt night, his mother would hold him and cry in a quavering voice that made the little boy feel weak and queasy. As soon as she had cried herself to sleep, the boy would wriggle out of her clinging grasp and curl up on the floor. It was hard and uncomfortable, but it hurt him more to be in her arms, because he knew, and this is how it was every night.\nEvery morning she would wake, and when she realized that he was not there she would panic. She found him as always, curled up on the floor next to the bed, and she would be angry. Because she knew she was smothering him. Because the little boy was all she had left.\nShe would get up and shove him awake with her foot.\nEvery day she sent the boy out into the forest to gather wood. He could have collected enough from the edge of the forest and come home quickly, but instead he took long walks. He loved to walk, to feel the moss beneath his feet, the bark on his fingertips, to hear the birds calling from the treetops.\nMost of all he loved to be alone in the teeming damp of the forest. He could not suffer being shut up in that little house with his mother.\nIt would be nearly dark when he\u2019d come home, and his mother would ask what had kept him so long.\n\u201cWhat did you see? Did you meet anyone in the woods, my son?\u201d\nEven though the boy knew that his mother wanted him to, he would not tell her about the forest. He said that he had seen nothing, met no one. Which was true. His long walks were utterly solitary; he never encountered anyone. Every day was the same, nothing ever changed.\nThe boy knew what would happen then. His mother would become sad, and begin her nightly ritual.\nShe would turn away from the boy, undress and stand silhouetted against the dying light of the fire. Then he would look away. Long ago he\u2019d grown tired of this. Still, she would wait until she was too cold and then she would slowly put on her nightgown and take his hand. She would undress her son and he would stand before his mother. She would look at him, but still he would look away.\nTired and cold, the boy would ask for his nightgown and she would give it to him, and watch as he slipped it over his head.\nShe looked at him that way every night to see how much he had grown, how much he had changed, in order to measure in her mind how much further he had moved away from her. Then she would pull her son close and hold him tightly against her body.\nShe would carry her son to their bed and lie down with him in her arms. He felt cold and distant, his face turned away from her, his eyes closed. She would hold his body against hers and try to warm him to her, but he remained cold. She would begin to cry then, softly at first until she could no longer hold back. As she cried her whole body would shake, and the boy\u2019s teeth would clatter together in his mouth. When she could cry no more, she would fall asleep.\nOne day the boy walked further than he had ever gone before, and he realized he did not know where he was. He became worried and decided to turn back.\nThe sky above was beginning to darken when he saw a little girl standing in a clearing.\nAt her feet was a large pile of wood, bound together with a fallen vine. The little girl smiled softly and stared at the boy. Without a word she hoisted the bundle of wood onto her back and began walking through the forest.\nThe boy followed after her. Darkness fell rapidly, but the little girl kept on walking faster and he could not keep up.\nBefore he knew it he had arrived back at his home, but the little girl was nowhere to be seen. The bundle of wood was sitting on the doorstep.\nThe boy went inside and sat down at the table where his mother had set out their usual dinner. She asked what had taken him so long.\n\u201cWhat did you see? Did you meet anyone in the woods, my son?\u201d\nFor once, the boy needed to talk, but when he tried he found he did not know what to say. He tried to tell her, tell her that he knew, that he had always known. But he could not find the words.\nInstead, he told his mother that he had met a strange little girl in the forest, and that she had helped him carry the wood home and then disappeared.\nHis mother was surprised. He had never spoken so plainly before. She thought: he must be lying. He must be hiding something. They finished their meal in silence and went to bed, the same as always, except the mother looked at her son even more sadly.\nThe next day the boy walked more slowly than usual. In the same place as before, deep in the forest, he found the little girl. In her hand she held out a blood-red rose, a type of flower that did not grow in that area.\nHe did not want to take it, but he knew he must.\nWhen his mother saw him coming with the flower, she was overcome with love. Her son had never brought her a flower before.\n\u201cWhere did you find such a beautiful flower, my child?\u201d\nThe little boy looked closely at the rose. Its soft velvet petals were tightly pursed together.\n\u201cThe little girl I met in the woods gave it to me,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the rose is in full blossom she will come again.\u201d\nHis mother did not understand, but placed the rose in a jar of water on the windowsill and joined her son for dinner. He would not look at her, only at his hands folded on the table before him.\nShe was hungry, but she could not eat. Instead she lay down in bed and began to cry.\nThe boy was sorry. He tucked himself into her arms to comfort her.\nIn the morning he set out into the forest the same as always, gathering wood as he went, but he did not see the little girl. When he came home in the evening, the rose had already started to bloom, the petals gently loosening.\nThe mother awoke with a start, as she did every day. She nudged the boy with her foot to wake him and went to the fireplace to rekindle the coals from the night before.\nThe boy did not get up.\nShe called to him and still he did not respond, so she went and shook him by the shoulders. His body was stiff and cold.\nAt that moment she remembered what he had said and looked at the rose in its jar of water on the windowsill. Sure enough, it was in full bloom; the velvet petals had opened fully into a sensual, red blossom.\nBefore she even had a chance to cry out, she heard a creak on the doorstep.\n[Inspired by \u201cThe Rose,\u201d by the Brothers Grimm. Regarding his striking image of the rose-bearing changeling, Fabulist house artist Adam Myers notes: \u201cI\u2019ve been re-reading all my old Sandman comics, so I think some of Dave McKean\u2019s great cover art from that era may have seeped into my head. Ironically, the rose I used for the picture was from my mom\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day bouquet.\u201d)","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

And then it tousled the hair up a bit even as I pulled myself away.\nI wended my way out of the train, squeezing past all others and thought about it.\nIt was good I was a few inches taller than him so it was an easy reach, his blond hair I mean, but it could not at all pass for unintended behaviour, or a \u2018excuse-me-as-I-pass- you-by- in-this-squeezed-like-hell-space.\nThere was enough room for me to maneuver without touching him at all. My arm and hand followed the impulse even as my mind said, \u201cNo, don\u2019t do it\u201d. But it happened.\nAnd while it happened I tried to stop myself from reddening and then my face also lit up like a lantern that suddenly catches fire and I blinked my blue eyes to shake the sweat droplets that were forming on the gaps between my drop-dead dreadlocks and front fringe and he must have been wondering what a peculiar looking man.\nI knew that his blond hair was calling out to be tousled.\nI am out of the train but he is behind me, I can smell him because I have more than my sixth sense, I have my seventh sense as well which I got when I visited my Seventh Heaven of Delight (yes, I have completed that part of my life) and its been there with me since that time and stands me in good stead in moments like this.\nSometimes it works against me as well, as when I don\u2019t want to smell something, like in something-fishy-going-on, but have to do so because of the existence of this sense.\nAnd I think of how I wanted to scrape my hands down his face and taste the blood thereafter to see how he tasted but that was for later and would not happen now.\nHe is close behind me and then he steps right there, in front of me and I have no choice but to dead-stop in my tracks.\nHe is looking at me and suddenly I find the gashes forming on his face just where I would have clawed him in my desire to taste him. He touches his face and licks his fingers as he looks at me and then I want to run before I see any more and all around us the crowd mills as he continues to do what he is doing. I want to join him in that.\nHe put his hand on my arm, my formerly deceptive arm, and my arm again deceives me and snakes across his body to feel his waist and then we are walking step to step and it is as if he can read my thoughts because he snuggles his face into my chest and says, \u201c I missed you,\u201d and I look at this face and the red gashes are bleeding holes now, waiting to be closed and consumed by me and I cannot not believe my eyes and then I feel I should tell him to go away but my body clings to his like a peach, sorry, leech, and I just want to be his blood and that he be mine and then we will be one once more.\nThe world whizzes past us and does not see his droplets fall on the ground or that I begin to run with him home so that I can save him before he dies.\nI had not wanted to recognize him, my own flesh and blood, but my body betrayed me.\nI did not want him to become a part of me, but I could not let him die. I mean, he had been a part of me, I had removed him from me because he was getting too heavy to carry, his wants, his demands, his desires an extra load that took so much from me.\nHe sucked and sucked till I felt faint because of his need. He would not grow away. He just continued to be a part of me, this tousled haired blond boy that refused to grow up, refused to leave my side long after Hera had left me.\nHera had decided to separate from the two of us a long time ago, and I remember how dismembered I had felt, because I depended on her for sustenance. I would milk her dry and then she would point at her breasts and say, have you not had enough? Have you not grown enough?\nI would look at her with eyes that beseeched her and she said no, I will grow old like this just feeding you and taking care of you. Its about time you fended for yourself and look at the boy who clings to you like a limpet sucking all the energy from you, my energy she said, and she just sat up one night and cut me away from her nipples, and they remained with her but I had separated.\nAnd I was no longer in her, a part of her, she just went away to survive on her own and she would because she was filled with the milk of humanity and when the gods have given you that and there is no one taking it from you anymore, you can do a lot for yourself.\nI did not have her, but my tousled boy still put out all his suckers and clung to all parts of me and sucked. And I knew that now I would have to remove him.\nIt had not been easy, the removal.\nHe had screamed and shouted and resisted and I had removed each suction point one by one and held it off to make sure that none remained with me for he could grow back onto me again then, from that one contact.\nAnd when the last one was removed I had seen him shrivel and crumple up into some kind of jelly fish but I had moved away because I had to fend for myself.\nIt is not easy to do that when all your life you only survive because you have lived off your mother who went away and then your wife who went away and then you look for someone else but after a time you have to find your own means of survival.\nSo I had. I had attached myself to another man and it was a give and take relationship, and though I felt quite starved, it was alright.\nHe did not become a part of me and I did not become apart of him, our blood was not allowed to mix because we did not want each other enough. If we had allowed that to happen we would have become a part of each other and sucked on each other for survival and then it would have been whoever was stronger would be the person in charge of the body.\nYou know what I mean, if his name is Richard, then if Richard sucked more out of me so that he became the greater part of us, then the body would be called Richard. Otherwise it would be called Llelewyn, which is my name.\nAs for the blond boy, my son, Neville, who had returned to me, I had no choice but to accept him now as a part of me. I needed him as much as he needed me, for I had not felt so wanted for a long time.\nHera was not there for me, Richard was just there, a kind of a \u2018will do\u2019 arrangement where neither of us was satisfied, but my son, he was there with me now.\nThough I know that he would make me die in the end for he would suck up all of me and make the body his, Neville\u2019s body, but I could not resist it any more.\nSo I was rushing him home so that I could plug all the leaking holes with myself and then he could be happy and I could be happy. I could not help myself now that he had reappeared in my life.\nHera would laugh at me if I told her, she would say that I would never learn, that I always needed someone, either to support me or be dependent on me, that I could never exist by myself, as myself.\nWell, she can laugh, and she may be right, but as my son sucks onto me, I feel at peace.\nThe world will carry on as it wants. This is my bliss. My mind may say no, this will destroy you, this stupid wanting of yours to be devoured and that too by your own son, it is not good, this mixing of the same blood, but my body has never felt happier.\nAll I can see now is the blondness of my boy and how beautiful he is as he grows stronger with me. I need this dependency. I only wish Hera was here for then we would be complete. Her independent spirit is difficult to hold on to. I dream of her breasts as Neville sticks onto me and I feel the milk filling up within me.\nI do keep in touch with Hera through my deep connection with her but she blocks me out of her system most times. Tonight she may have realized that I had a special need so she allowed me to access her and then when she found out what I had done, and that I would also be trying to access her from a distance for sustenance once again, she ws furious with me.\nI felt her milk drying up as I dreamt, she was blocking me out completely, and I cried out in anguish, there is no other word for it.\nI asked her if she had forgotten our times together in the Seventh Heaven of Delight which we had visited and the promises we had made each other and she said that these promises are not binding on anyone and are often made in moments of happiness and passion but the real world is different and I should realize that.\nAnd now I had Neville once again in my life, and she thought that was the stupidest thing to have done when I was carrying on fine with Richard.\nRichard had not appeared after I came home with Neville. He knew his time with me was over. He would find someone else, since he was used to surface living and that is not so difficult a thing if that is all you want.\nFor me, passion was everything and that is why I suffered the way I did. I felt incomplete most times if I was not attached to someone enough.\nThe Government advocated \u2018surface- living\u2019 and \u2018free-floating\u2019, and \u2018non-attachment\u2019 \u2014 this was the new mantra and society followed it.\nThe Government held that in this way people could be individuals in their own right and function separately and become attached only to the greater issues and not get involved into personal entanglements. People were surviving on this basis.\nHera was doing very well for herself, the only thing was of course she was bloating a bit with all the milk filling up within her and no takers for it.\nWhen I asked her about it she said that the Government was making arrangements to release it from her and bottle it up for marketing because people needed this milk of humanity for survival at times.\nI told her that I needed it and she could do me a favour by allowing me to get at it but she had laughed and said there is no profit in you. This way I sell to the government. Her laugh had made me cringe.\nYet I wanted her so badly that I would have done anything to have her back in my life and I said so and she disconnected her thoughts from mine. She did not want to deal with me all over again.\nNeville is fast asleep, over and around me. I try not to think of fate and all those kind of things because if my arm had not gone out to tousle my blond son\u2019s hair in the train then perhaps I could have continued to survive.\nI knew that he had been searching for me and wanted me to become his again and that is why he had shone his blondness like a beacon in the train.\nHe knew that I am unable to resist this part of him, and that I would succumb if he was near enough again.\nI allow myself to drift off since there is no point in thinking too much about things. I have to accept that I will grow no more since I have no sustenance and have stopped looking for it now, there is no one else who will fill me up the way Hera did.\nNeville will take from me all that I am and soon I will be no more, it will be Neville and then he will be on the prowl for someone else. I will just be a small part of him and maybe I can guide him in his quest, but that is about it.\nI stroke Neville\u2019s hair and my eyes close.\nAbha Iyengar has her work published internationally in print and on the net \u2014 poems, articles, essays, fiction, non-fiction.

Shuli says it\u2019s dirty: the bits of soil sprinkling the white vinyl, the tiny rusted spade leaned against a pot, the cup of murky water replenished once a week.\nEli\u2019s natural standing posture has a slight slouch where her elbows angle forward and her spine curves like a flattened S; Shuli stands straight, chest slightly puffed, even when Eli is the only other person in the room.\nShuli is better than Eli at almost everything; even her smile is prettier, more dimple-y, whatever that means.\nWhy can\u2019t you have what she has? The shadows ask Eli.\nEli doesn\u2019t mind. Clones are not substitutes or replacements; they\u2019re resources. Plus, Eli likes to watch from her small room as Shuli plays outside. She likes to watch Shuli building snow forts and snow sofas that\u2019d hurt your butt instead of cushion it, the white dusting her hair, the chilly air coloring her nose bright red, and when Shuli stomps through fresh patches of snow, Eli imagines snow boots compressing a cloud with a quiet crunch, like crushing tissue into your palm.\nWhen spring comes, Shuli takes walks around the garden, stopping and resuming at different bundles of flowers Eli doesn\u2019t know the names of, and Shuli will sometimes kick her shoes into the grass and prance barefoot beside the fence \u2014 although she never runs. She\u2019s always holding back from running, like she might lose something if she moves too fast, like she might burst if she outpaces her breath.\nSometimes nurses have to hold onto Shuli in case she flits away, collapses into the air.\nShuli has stopped doing all of that now. Now, a man accompanies Shuli on the walks, and Shuli wraps her arm around his elbow as they point to tiny birds perched at the center of flowers, and Eli wonders how their elbows interlace so smoothly, like wrapped ribbons rather than angled joints.\nIn the summer, Shuli sits on a blanket on the grass with a basket of yellow peaches while the child stomps on fallen petals and hollers \u2014although Eli can\u2019t hear anything, only marvel at how wide the child can stretch their mouth and how little of a reaction it provokes from Shuli.\nAutumn is when Eli tracks the leaves turning red and it\u2019s also when Shuli dresses in the long, chocolate-colored cardigan which Eli thinks looks so soft and deep, like it\u2019d catch her if she fell from the window, envelop her in a nest of knitted acrylic. But this past autumn, Shuli only showed up a few times, and always with someone else \u2014 the man, a priest, a nurse \u2014 and Eli was left counting how many different shades of red leaves she can spot from behind a window.\nThe shadows tell her to escape. They can stretch their particles thin enough to slip through the cracks and unlock the window from the outside. Like fairy dust, Eli thinks. The shadows have the personality of a dog, cuddling up against her back when she sleeps, curling between her feet as wisps of smoke whenever she paces from the window to the door, demanding attention when her gaze fixates on Shuli or the flowers or the man or the child for too long.\nEli doesn\u2019t escape. The priests say clones are cursed and that\u2019s why only she can see the shadows. They installed a wood kneeler bench for her to pray for the curse to be lifted. Her knee caps are blue and purple from the hard surface, but she refuses the shadows\u2019 attempt to cushion the wood. It\u2019s the least she can do for existing.\nThe priests leave her meals on the ground outside her door. She waits until the footsteps fade before retrieving the tray to sip a tepid bowl of congee and chew through the small bag of pickled cucumbers.\nShuli used to visit Eli\u2019s room once a week. Shuli would brush Eli\u2019s hair with a small jade comb; its teeth felt like icicles skimming her scalp. She\u2019d bring fancy dresses for Eli to model, and clap and cheer as Eli spun and the skirts swooshed around, brushing her legs and the floor. She\u2019d tell Eli they were building memories together, as individuals.\nAfter Shuli met the man, she visited Eli less and less until she stopped coming altogether, and it was just Eli and the shadows and the snow peas.\nIt\u2019s because I\u2019ve grown up and you haven\u2019t, Shuli explained during her second-to-last visit.\nThey spent that day leafing through Eli\u2019s prayer books, debating whether Eli was truly cursed if she was only an approximate clone. Did the curse slip through qubit copies, between orthogonal dimensions, before subsequent measurements of state have collapsed from observation? Was she cursed because she was useless?\nIs that canceled out by death? Eli had asked.\nMaybe, was Shuli\u2019s answer before she spotted the half-eaten plate of rice pudding and a cold cup of honeysuckle tea and chastised Eli for wasting food. For every grain of rice you leave, you gain a pocket on your face.\nShuli\u2019s face had begun to grow pockets, like her skin had been stabbed with bamboo shoots and crumpled like paper while Eli\u2019s face remained smooth as paper. Shuli still had the prettier smile.\nWhen Eli sits by the window, the shadows cradle her head so her cheek doesn\u2019t rub against the dirt-covered sill. Shuli never crosses into the garden again.\nThe priests say making clones demands equal life in return. It\u2019s not just about making genetic copies, replicating cells, resurrecting pluripotency \u2014 the human psyche goes deeper than that, which is where things often go wrong \u2014 like why Eli can sit in silence for days entertained by her thoughts while Shuli would start mumbling to herself after a single day\u2019s isolation.\nCloning the soul of a person requires a sliver of the original soul and filler substance: something like styrofoam, silicone, cartilage, or in Eli\u2019s case, the shadows.\nThe fragmented soul latches onto the substrate and crystallizes out. It\u2019s not a real clone, but mimicry, an artificial growth contaminated by imperfect fillers. These chimera souls don\u2019t evolve or adapt, not like real ones.\nEli knows she\u2019s an abomination. She thinks growing snow peas might balance out the cost of her existence: take a life, coax a life full of pods that can sprout even more lives from the soil. She tells the shadows not to go near the snow peas, afraid they might rot the roots and turn them mushy like tofu brains.\nWhen winter returns, Eli watches the snow accumulating in layers, fluffy and pristine. There\u2019s no one to roll snowballs, pack the snow down into dense seat structures, smooth edges of mounds into igloos. Her snow pea plant has dried and browned. Shuli hasn\u2019t visited in months now.\nEli asks the shadows to unlock the windows. Then she steps on the sill, hands gripping the edges, the wind cutting at her knuckles, her cheeks. The shadows catch her as she jumps, softly lowering her to the ground. Eli steps into the snow, sinking abruptly to her knees.\nIt\u2019s so light, she tells them as she drags one leg up and then another. She\u2019s out of breath by the third step.\nThe child runs past, nearly toppling her. The child spins around. Ma?\nEli shakes her head. No, not ma. Eli.\nMa, the child cries again, tossing fistfuls of snow into her face. Eli dodges the snow and the child continues to fling white flurries at her. She was already out of breath, and now her nose is runny and she wonders if you can cough your heart out of your mouth.\nEli wasn\u2019t supposed to have a weak heart. The one part of Shuli that wasn\u2019t supposed to be cloned. Eli knows she\u2019s a resource drain, a machine of organs consuming resources without purpose, a soul warped from the source.\nIf things had gone right, she might\u2019ve been subsumed as part of Shuli: Eli\u2019s heart pumping blood to Shuli\u2019s limbs, fueling that dimpled smile, as things should\u2019ve been.\nEli, she repeats.\nThe child laughs and spins, nearly stomping over the shadows that have spread themselves in a thin layer over the untouched surfaces of the snow.\nThe shadows gather into a dark mass, gliding around the scattering of small and smaller footprints. When they reach Eli, they sink through her pores, and as though her heart might disintegrate into qubits and stem cells, they hug it tightly.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

She would position the cap at harsh angles and make funny faces. Beech would laugh, ruffle her hair or squeeze her earlobe. Other times, she wore the cap turned inside out, though Beech didn\u2019t like that. And sometimes she simply stared at her reflection in the vanity mirror and wished that the embroidered patch above the cap\u2019s visor was the profile of a man she might meet, someone who wanted to make a family, who wasn\u2019t always running away from trouble, someone the opposite of Beech.\nGinny and Beech had driven all night across two states. They would still be driving if Ginny hadn\u2019t spotted the park. She had convinced Beech to stop so they could lay on the blanket and rest. She liked this park and was glad they had found it. It was quiet except for the squeals of two children who played on a swing set across the way.\nGinny reclined next to Beech on the wool army blanket and stared into Beech\u2019s armpit. Fungus mottled the roots of his hair. She\u2019d grown used to Beech\u2019s odors but she didn\u2019t always like them. She looked away from him and admired the buckles on her shoes. She polished the buckles several times a day and even wore her shoes when she slept. She would wiggle her feet and the shine from the buckles helped her fall asleep.\nBeech pried his sneakers off. Two of his toes poked through a hole in his sock. The toenail of his big toe was yellow and brown and it twisted inward at the sides. The skin around the nail bed glowed red. Ginny heard a squeal from the swing set. The little girl lay face up on a swing. The boy dangled dangerously above her, his feet kicking close to the girl\u2019s face as he held himself up by the chains.\n\u201cI want a long, hot bath,\u201d Ginny said.\n\u201cNo place here to get a bath,\u201d Beech said. The knife he held was sharp. Before stopping at the park, they\u2019d bought food at an A&P market. He cut through a hunk of bologna and flipped a chunk to Ginny. Using the knife as a fork, he cut another piece, stabbed the meat into his mouth and licked the blade clean.\nGinny chewed the cold cut and counted. \u201cOne, two, three.\u201d\n\u201cWe could find a motel,\u201d Beech said. \u201cOr someone\u2019s empty house.\u201d He sat up and pressed the blade\u2019s tip against his toe, the red skin blanching. He traced the infection until the blade rested between his toes.\nGinny kept counting. \u201cEleven, twelve, thirteen.\u201d\n\u201cHow much of that money is left?\u201d He pinched Ginny\u2019s thigh when she didn\u2019t answer.\n\u201cShit!\u201d Ginny said. \u201cYou made me lose count.\u201d\n\u201cHow much?\u201d\n\u201cFifty-three dollars,\u201d she said.\n\u201cOut of eight hundred?\u201d\nGinny spit the bologna into her hand and threw it into a bed of weeds. \u201cCut me some more.\u201d\nBeech cut a chunk of bologna and handed it to her.\n\u201cThirty-two chews is when the vitamins come out,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter that, ask me any damn question.\u201d\nShe forced the meat into her mouth and counted again.\nThe sun was bright; she shaded her eyes and faced into the breeze, a cool caress of lilac, though there were no flowers that she could see. The park, tucked between low rise tenements only two blocks away from the A&P, offered a slide, a swing set and, opposite these, restrooms resembling a gingerbread house that plainly suffered from neglect. Milkweeds prospered in the sand lot. Worst of all, the grass hadn\u2019t been mowed. In some patches, it grew tall; elsewhere, weeds suffocated the grass, a fight the weeds and dandelions were winning. When she had lived at home, before her and Beech had to leave, Ginny\u2019s father and uncle had always made her mow the grass. It had been difficult to maneuver the heavy mower, but she managed it because she wanted to look tough.\nGinny reached the count of thirty-two and threw her chewed bologna into the weeds.\n\u201cYou want more?\u201d Beech asked.\n\u201cI can\u2019t stand but one more.\u201d\nBeech tossed a chunk into the air, and as Ginny caught it in her mouth, she spotted the young man who bagged at the A&P. She pointed to the gingerbread restrooms where a flock of pigeons that pecked at the walkway meandered out of the boy\u2019s path.\n\u201cThere\u2019s that guy from the A&P,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s still staring at you.\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Beech said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s staring at you.\u201d\n\u201cI said shut up.\u201d\n\u201cI think he likes you.\u201d She tickled Beech under his belt line.\n\u201cCut it out,\u201d Beech said.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s cute. Don\u2019t you think he\u2019s cute?\u201d\n\u201cKnock it off.\u201d Beech smashed the last chunk of bologna against Ginny\u2019s mouth. She pushed his hand away, and spit her chewed bologna into the weeds.\nThe young man from the A&P opened the restroom door and went in.\nThe pigeons stirred but stayed put.\nBeech put on his sneakers and stood up. \u201cHold this.\u201d He handed his cap to Ginny and walked towards the restrooms.\nThe cap lay low on her forehead, not quite blocking her vision. She loved that the cap was red, white, and blue because those colors reminded her of her birthdays. Her father and uncle had always celebrated her birthday on the Fourth, even though she\u2019d been born on the tenth of July. Instead of candles, they put sparklers on her birthday cakes. Sparklers fascinated Ginny; she loved the streaks of purple and yellow that scarred the dark whenever she waved the sparklers in front of her.\nOn her sixteenth birthday, a sparkler burned her right hand. To help her forget the pain, her father pinched her belly. \u201cYou got a knife in you,\u201d he said. \u201cShould I leave it in or pull it out?\u201d The pain grew intense. Her father had played this game for as long as she could remember. If she told him to pull the knife out, he would pull her skin and release the pinch slowly. If she told him to leave it in, he pinched harder.\nGinny fought a wave of nausea. Beech neared the restrooms, wrapped his knife inside a black handkerchief and then tucked it into his back pocket. She knew what his strut meant, how when he pushed his weight onto his toes it was meant to diminish the wiggle of his hips. When he flexed his thumbs away from his body, it was meant to make him look edgy, ready to pounce.\nThe pigeons hurried out of Beech\u2019s path.\nThe hinges on the restroom door creaked, and the children across the park laughed. Ginny scratched her ankle, the buckle on her shoe snatching a glint of sun and blinding her for a second. She hugged her legs against her chest and pulled her large sweater over her calves, hiding her unshaved legs and her awkward knees that seemed too large. A fine layer of ash always seemed to dust the crown of her kneecaps. She had just turned eighteen but wanted to appear younger.\nThe two children laughed again as the boy sputtered down the slide: stop, go. Stop, go. Stop, go.\nThe girl had crystal blond hair that soaked up the sun. She gathered dandelions. Ginny picked up the remaining chunk of bologna and squeezed, her fingernails tearing into the soft meat.\nThe pigeons on the walkway in front of the restroom stopped pecking.\nThey raised their heads, listening.\nThe bologna broke apart and Ginny threw the scraps into the weeds. She cradled her hand, the same hand she\u2019d burned two years ago, and then pressed her palm into her lap, trying to smother the phantom burn. She closed her eyes and felt herself shrinking so that the park, Beech, the restrooms, and the two children all seemed to become a tangle of shadows and shine. The burn traveled into her lap and then shot upwards into her stomach. She pushed herself to her feet and stepped across the blanket, but stumbled into a patch of milkweeds where she fell to her knees, her outstretched hand landing on a lump of chewed bologna. She tried to vomit but nothing came out. She picked herself up and walked towards the swings and the children.\nBut the swings were empty, the children gone, their laughter now echoes in the park. From somewhere behind her came a boy\u2019s hollowed yell. She turned towards the gingerbread restrooms.\nThe pigeons scattered and took flight.\nOne bird flew toward her, its beak a blade, its talons outstretched.\nShe ran, the pigeon close, as if giving chase. It landed near a bench, and then she noticed, right there, in front of the bench, the two children engaged in a tug-of-war over the girl\u2019s doll. The boy jerked the doll out of the girl\u2019s grasp and pushed her into a patch of dandelions.\n\u201cDon\u2019t hurt her.\u201d Ginny ran to the boy and tugged at the doll\u2019s legs.\nThe doll\u2019s head broke away from the body and the boy fell backwards onto his butt. Not caring if she hurt him, Ginny grabbed the boy\u2019s arm and pried the doll\u2019s head from his grip. When she raised the doll\u2019s head into the air and threatened to throw it at the boy, he stood up and ran away.\nThe little girl had picked herself up and was seated on the bench. The dandelions she had gathered lay next to her.\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d Ginny said. She knelt in front of the girl. \u201cWe\u2019ll tell your mommy on that bully.\u201d\nThe girl cried harder. \u201cI don\u2019t have a mommy.\u201d\nGinny touched the girl\u2019s knee.\n\u201cDaddy never does anything to him.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s fix your dolly.\u201d Ginny gave the girl the doll body and head.\nWhen the girl pushed the doll\u2019s head against the body, it wouldn\u2019t attach. Ginny tried to help but the girl shook her off and smashed the head against the body. It didn\u2019t work.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d the girl said.\nGinny slapped her and then hugged her. \u201cOh, don\u2019t make me do that.\u201d Ginny let go and caressed the red handprint on the girl\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll be your mommy, okay? But don\u2019t tell anyone. Not your daddy or anyone. Whenever anyone does something bad to you, come tell me.\u201d She petted the girl\u2019s head and cooed. \u201cThere now. You sure are pretty.\u201d\nThe girl rocked the doll in her arms.\nGinny picked up a dandelion. \u201cDo you like butter? If this flower makes your chin glow yellow, that means you like butter.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s buttercups.\u201d\n\u201cIt works better with dandelions.\u201d Ginny held the dandelion under the girl\u2019s chin. \u201cSee, you do like butter.\u201d\nThe girl grabbed the dandelion and held it up under Ginny\u2019s chin, then chuckled.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d Ginny said.\nThe girl moved the dandelion back and forth under Ginny\u2019s chin. \u201cYou\u2019re a ghost.\u201d She wiggled the dandelion, teasing Ginny\u2019s chin. \u201cGhost, ghost, ghost.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a ghost. Stop that.\u201d Ginny tore the dandelion from the girl\u2019s grasp, scooped the girl into her arms, and carried her towards the swings.\nGinny hadn\u2019t seen Beech come out of the restrooms and hadn\u2019t seen him cross the park to the swings. But there he was now, in front of her, swinging back and forth, pumping his legs, humping the air.\n\u201cCome sit on my lap,\u201d he said.\nGinny turned to run away but Beech soared off the swing and grabbed her hair from behind.\n\u201cGet back here,\u201d he said.\nGinny stood the girl on her feet and the girl ran to the swings.\n\u201cI told you not to turn my cap inside out.\u201d He yanked the cap from Ginny\u2019s head.\nShe could feel his moist breath on her ear. He let her go and she fell to her knees. It was only when she turned to look at him that she noticed spatters of blood on his pant legs and sneakers. She pressed her stomach, the nausea rising. She screeched and pulled her hair, ripping a strand out.\n\u201cWhat the fuck about me!\u201d she said.\n\u201cDon\u2019t yell,\u201d Beech said. \u201cSomeone\u2019ll hear.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll yell, I\u2019ll yell. What the fuck about me!\u201d She bowed before him and buried her face in a patch of weeds, resisting when his hands touched her shoulders but then acquiescing as he pulled her to her feet.\nShe buried her face in his neck. \u201cAll this day\u2019s been for you.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d he said.\n\u201cEating bologna. The restrooms. That A&P guy. It\u2019s all been for you.\u201d\nHe set her on her feet and, in a moment, she felt the scratch of the woolen army blanket across her neck and shoulders. She pulled the blanket up, covering her head.\n\u201cLet\u2019s walk to the car,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d He put his arm around her shoulder.\n\u201cI want something for me, Beech.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d he said.\nUnderneath the blanket, flashes of sunlight played off her buckles. \u201cPlease, Beech. I want something for me.\u201d\n#\nThe car seat was cold against her legs where the blanket did not reach. She covered her eyes, the blanket a hood. The car door slammed. She listened for Beech\u2019s footsteps but could not hear them. She waited and thought about dandelions.\n\u201cI like the dark,\u201d she said. \u201cI like it.\u201d\nShe imagined her and Beech on the road again, driving. Beech would let her wear his cap. Maybe in one of the states that allowed fireworks, they could buy sparklers. There were footsteps, the flapping of wings.\n\u201cBeech?\u201d\nShe heard nothing.\n\u201cBeech?\u201d\nShe pulled the blanket tight around her face, the darkness warming her.\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to stay right here. I\u2019m going to stay\u2014\u201d\nThe rear car door opened and something slid into the back seat. Then the door slammed. The driver\u2019s door opened and Beech\u2019s odor found her. The engine kicked over, the radio blared, the car jerked forward.\nThrough the rise of Patsy Cline\u2019s voice on the radio Ginny pretended the muffled cries behind her were pigeons cooing. She cuddled against the car seat, and wiggled her feet. She wanted to laugh but instead bit her bottom lip. Unable to control herself, she kicked and bounced her feet against the floor.\n\u201cIt\u2019s only for a while,\u201d Beech said. \u201cThen, I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d\nGinny chuckled. She knew different. I\u2019ll stop you, she thought. She kicked harder against the floor. I\u2019ll blind you. I\u2019m her secret mother. I\u2019ll kill you.\nShe would take the blanket down and then look behind her, but not now.\nThe car shook, its skeleton jarred by ruts and potholes.\nShe would look behind her, but not now. She would wait until just the right moment, until she\u2019d forgotten.\nThen she would take down the blanket.\nThen it would be a surprise.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

A tiny stream runs circuitously in the deepest part of the riverbed. It is hardly more than a foot wide. My brother and I are picking our way with rod and staff, among the ancient stones, using great care.\n\u201cThis is the way I came before; little has changed,\u201d he says.\nI studied him, so handsome in life and now in this, even more so. I see his cheek, still damp from the tears I licked there as he lay dying; licked them to get the last of the salty essence into me that made us brothers.\nThere is a rushing of wind. Leaves and dust are blown up. I feel like laughing. Our clothes and hair are blown; our eyes are squinted for protection. I look up from my job; writing things down, that demands so much attention. I see a pillar of water, then another and another.\n\u201cFirst the wind, then the rain,\u201d I say.\nThe pillars of water are twelve feet high, revolving and about eighteen inches in diameter, no greater at top or bottom. I reach out to touch one as it moves by me.\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch the water,\u201d he says. Always the big brother.\nThere is graciousness in their movements, and as I touch the side, it pauses, as if waiting to be caressed.\nWater splashes out onto my clothing and shoes, onto the dry rocks and makes them shine, but when I remove my hands, they are not wet.\nThe columns move on, gracefully, purposefully, effortlessly \u2014 with intent, as if following a path. They weave among the rocks and stones, and seem especially interested in those cairns and pillars stacked by previous pilgrims.\nTheir movements disturb not a single stone, although the power of these energized, kinetically happening, spontaneously generated columns of water is obvious. They pick up huge boulders, dozens of them, inspect them and set them down as they were for centuries.\nOnly a light click of stone on stone can be heard, and this clicking has a musical ring to it, and a subtle, pleasing rhythm.\nThere is meaning to it I cannot ken, like a code in song \u2014 more \u2014 it was as if a lock was being opened and tumbler after tumbler fell in sequence as the combination was advanced.\nMany years ago, at the dock where my brother kept a small sailboat, some birds (I forget what kind) had built a nest into the gravel right on the quay.\nAt first, I almost stepped on it. (\u201cKilldeer\u201d, he says now, \u201cthat\u2019s what they\u2019re called, Killdeer.\u201d) It was so undistinguished. To distract me from the nest and eggs, the mother flew away as prey, a charade of injury to which I had no key.\nThe nest was but a saucered depression in the number six yard stone, yet the closer I looked the more evident it became that this was the work of a master mason who had no need of a compass or square, mallet or rule. Every stone, every pebble, every piece of dust and down had been laid so, just so into that concave depression.\nI sat down in wonder, cross-legged, and ran my fingertips around the edge of the nest, careful not to disturb the clutch of tiny eggs. My brother stands over me, holding out his hand to help me up.\n\u201cCome back.\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there now. Let\u2019s keep going.\u201d","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Image source: The Tucson Daily Photo.\nThe Kurdsenway Farm sells cheese by the roadside, but should reconsider their spokeperson\u2019s tall pointed hat.\nAnd the fact that he is six. No one trusts kids any more. They are always using guns. No one would feel safe enough to stop and buy his cheese. What might he be hiding in that big wicker basket?\nWhen he opens it, butterflies flit out. They fight for the top of his hat. It tastes like nectar. It tastes like bees. Like lightning drips of glee.\nHe decides maybe they should stick to selling eggs. He paints them all before putting them in the cartons. He colors them with egg tempera. Detailed replicas, scenes of the Last Supper. Soylent Green. Mr. Rogers.\nHis mother has told him he is uninsurable, and always will be. Because anyone can see he is strange. She tells him he should be painting on the eggs: Moonlight Sonata, Dick Cavett, Ring Around the Rosy.\nHe finds solace with the mottled goats. They like to eat his funny hat, and so he makes another. And another and another, and still, they eat. Their eyes smiling, their jaws moving sideways, their ears expectant, their chins level and unwavering.\nHe tells the customers that Heaven is not a concept. It is real. He has evidence. He takes off his hat to show them a stack of cards he keeps in there that teach them about God. He makes them guess what God is. What if you died, and found out you were wrong about it all? And God was really dying. And needed you to save him. But you were dead. Wouldn\u2019t you feel silly?\nHow much are the eggs, the customers ask. They don\u2019t come back. They never come back.\nNo one ever asked the eggs. But one day, they rebel. When he is painting Rasputin on one of them, it can\u2019t take it any more. It breaks its shells with impulsivity. It is virginal. The chick has a sunny disposition.\nWe are dead to our eggs, now, say the chicks, and they to us. Oh, they are quite erudite.\nThe little boy grows jaded. He begins to paint the entire farm. Every inch of grass and dirt and gravel and puddle is one large masterpiece just as good as a post-Raphaelite birthery scene. His mother figures prominently in the egg-tempera painting galore.\nOut of her painted mouth comes an opalescent apricot-colored scroll waving and coiling in the breeze. She is covered in iridescent fish scales. She is naked, with gills and flippers. She is giving birth to the sea.\nMuffin!, she calls him from the kitchen, time to come in and clean the toilet. I see someone missed it a wee bit with his wee wee didn\u2019t he he?\nHe puts down his brush. His thoughts redefine themselves, like Scrabble.\nAfter he cleans the toilet, she rewards him with a very short lock of her hair. He doesn\u2019t know where to set it. It gets everywhere. It chases him around in the breeze.\nHe runs outside. He plays with the sheep in the ways he knows best. He asks them questions about mathematics. About clouds that look like one thing one minute, and something else the next. Are they one thing, or two?","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

We tickle his lungs with our wings. The sun always leads us back to him and, on our return, we dance our furred bodies on his tongue.\nHome rents a studio flat on the first floor of a Victorian house in Stoke Newington. It is large enough for a single bed against one wall, a kitchen squeezed along the opposite wall with cupboards overhead for his pasta and tins of soup, and a pine clothes chest in the corner.\nBalanced on top of the chest: Home\u2019s slippers and both pairs of shoes, a stack of handkerchiefs, a dusty record player, and a framed photograph of a human who looks like a smaller, rounder Home without the grey in his hair.\nWe have not met this human.\nHome\u2019s waistcoat (which he never wears) and his white cotton apron and cap (which he wears every day at the bakery) hang on the back of the door. There is always a small patch of flour on the threshold.\nHome\u2019s garden is a tray on the windowsill. If he remembers to water the tray, it makes Home\u2019s flat smell of basil, parsley, and thyme, depending on where we fly.\nIt is not large enough for Home to build us a wooden hive.\nInstead, he invited us into the vestigial hollows that he does not need. There was plenty of room inside Home. Our queen nested in his appendix. This was the first space he gave to us and it was perfect for her: a snug tunnel branching off between his small and large intestines. We made it ready before her arrival, coating it with wax until it felt strong and smooth as the queen cup she hatched in. When it was done, a hush fell: a collective stilling of our wings as we watched her land. She settled in with a sigh. Home barely noticed.\nWe did not want to start taking ribs but our queen lays two thousand eggs each day and we were forced to build a cone for them to hatch and grow. Only the two uppermost ribs though, so the cone just nudges his throat. Larvae uncoil their chubby white bodies in geometric cells glued to his windpipe. We only take as much as we need.\nHe needs us too. Home used to make a lot of tears. We watched him before we moved in, scouted him from the crack in the kitchen\u2019s middle cupboard and the pocket of his apron where we hid among the breadcrumbs. One of us followed the curl of his glasses round the back of his ear. One nested in his stack of handkerchiefs, although these always ended up damp and crumpled on the floor, in the gap between bed and fridge. In the evenings, we saw him curl up on the bed, with his hands, still dusted with flour, over his face.\nRent is expensive in this city but we pay him well: he never weeps salt any more. Only sweetness. We take away the sting and fashion it into honey behind his eyes so it trickles down his cheeks, catching in the stubble.\nThis year, Home has been weeping less. A woman comes to Home\u2019s flat. We do not like her. She makes him smile and she makes him laugh and this means his ribs shake, sending tremors through our foundations. This is not good for our hive. Home still uses his handkerchiefs, but he does not leave them on the floor where the woman would see them; he takes them to the launderette to wash away the crusted honey stains.\nThe woman does not think we are good for Home. She has swatted at us with rolled-up newspapers and picked our larvae from his throat with her glossy fingernails. One morning, she made a pot of tea and sat on the edge of Home\u2019s bed, waiting for him to flip fried eggs onto two slices of toast. Wrapped round her mug, the woman\u2019s hands were covered in sticking plasters and a pink rash, because each time she touches Home\u2019s chest we sting her fingers.\nThe first time we did this she just laughed and kissed his cheek with its trace of sweetness and said, I don\u2019t mind. Now there are a pair of tweezers in a teacup next to the bed, where there used to be crumpled handkerchiefs. Home uses them to remove our stings. He is becoming ungrateful.\nWhen Home sat too, settling onto the creaking mattress, they balanced trays on their knees. With her sore fingers, the woman shook pepper onto her eggs. She took a sip of her tea. Still gazing into her mug, she said, tell me how I can help.\nHome is loyal to us though, and we value loyalty. He pushed yolk around his plate and stirred his tea even though we know that he doesn\u2019t take sugar. He said, they\u2019re a bit runny in the middle, I hope you don\u2019t mind.\nShe slid her tray onto the quilt and a hand over his hand and said, what can I do?\nWe hummed in agreement as he shushed her. Don\u2019t worry about me, said Home. He squeezed her hand and she winced at the pressure on her stings.\nDon\u2019t worry, we echoed, at a frequency they do not understand but they do feel. We oil his kneecaps with wax now, and polish his shoulder blades with our footpads. We mind his spine as if it were ours. We live here. You will never know him as well as we do.\nI am worried, said the woman.\nThey don\u2019t nest anywhere important, said Home, tugging down the sleeves of his dressing gown. If you look closely at the thin skin on the inside of wrists, you will see we have tidied his meandering veins into hexagons.\nHe said, I could smoke them out any time, if I wanted to.\nCould you, she said. We felt her mug shaking slightly in her hands. She drew her tray back onto her knees and stabbed at her toast. They finished their eggs in silence.\nBefore he washed their plates, Home kissed the woman\u2019s fingers one by one. She held them out stiffly as he tweezed another sting and stroked on another plaster. With fingers already careful from rolling croissants and plaiting dough, he is learning to ease out the stinger without spilling our venom. Workers are dying for nothing; we will have to try harder.\nHome turned on the hot tap to fill the sink and the gushing of the water covered the sound of our wings as, behind his back, we swarmed the woman\u2019s head. She sighed and got up to put Home\u2019s milk back in his fridge; she is used to shaking us off.\nThere is a handwritten recipe stuck to the fridge. The recipe is from the time that the woman put on a jazz record and Home\u2019s apron, with a knot in the neck loop to make it fit, and baked honey-orange madeleines. The paper is still sticky with orange juice and honey, but she doesn\u2019t bake with honey any more, not since we took the rest of Home\u2019s ribs.\nWe only take what we need, but Home\u2019s heart is swelling. Our wax walls are strained by its heat and the shudder of its pulse. They needed reinforcing. Now his ribs are beams.\nThe woman closed the fridge and rested her head on Home\u2019s shoulder, shifting when one of us crawled onto her neck. Drying his hands on a tea towel, Home remembered the new key.\nThe woman scratched at her stings while Home fetched the key from a hook on the wall. There are two other, identical keys hanging on the hook and Home has labelled them with question marks because he does not know why they do not let the woman into the flat. We know, because it is our workers who take turns to hover in the keyhole whenever we hear the woman\u2019s soft step and the jangle as she reaches into her pocket.\nAfter the woman kissed Home\u2019s cheek and let herself out, Home sank onto the bed and whispered to us.\nI need my heart back, he said, just the heart.\nWe know this. But we need it. We have moved our queen there. She lounges, massive and serene. Eggs are laid in his atria and honey is pumped through his arteries. Home does not tell the woman this, but she can tell that she is sharing his heart. We shined it with royal jelly so that her fingers slip from it.\nThat night, Home sat awake past midnight. Reaching into his chest, he held lit matches to all the cavities we nest in. Our columns softened; our perfect tessellations began to sag. Melted wax seeped stinging from his pores. Our feet pattered frantic on his heart as we rushed to tend to our queen. His skin singed. Larvae blistered and burst.\nHome fell asleep bleeding flakes of our nest and coughing charcoal. For three days afterwards, we stopped crafting honey while we brushed the crumbled hallways of our Home, buzzing a deep grumble through his bones so he knew he had hurt us. We thought, we have never had to sting him before but we might have to. He cried salt tears again; let him remember how he misses us.\nWe still watch through the keyhole when the woman arrives, although she has stopped trying the key. The next time she came to our flat, she eased off her gloves at the door and stowed them away in her handbag before ringing the bell \u2014 the gloves she has begun to wear so she does not have to explain her puffy, blistered fingers.\nI told you, Home swept through the door in his apron and covered the woman in flour, I told you I could make them leave any time.\nAll of them?\nHome stepped back, put his hands in his apron pockets. He said, a few of them won\u2019t do me any harm. Just a small hive. But they\u2019re gone from my heart.\nThe woman did not speak. She put her arms around Home but she did not look at him. When she put her ear to his chest the beat was faint beneath our buzz.\nHome spoke into her ear, told her, there\u2019s room for you here now.\nThe woman let go. Yes, she said, maybe.\nWe are leaving soon. The woman\u2019s breath is like smoke in Home\u2019s lungs and our queen deserves better. Home can feel our agitation, a rumble all the way to his toes. Workers are engorging themselves with honey to prepare for our new home and for this, we must feed on him, so he is tired. We are good tenants; it is the least he owes us.\nThe woman has started to wear netting over her face when she visits. She is tired too. We can hear her treading along the corridor to our flat again; let\u2019s sticky her hair with honey as Home lets her in.\nDon\u2019t bother brushing it out, she says.\nHome holds her elbows, avoiding her hands. He tells her that we are leaving, really this time, and she smiles beneath her netting but she is shaking her head. When he lifts the netting to kiss her, she brushes his hand away as if it was one of us.\nWe can tell she is restless too. We can hear what they can\u2019t: the unhappy hum of her wings. There is not room for all of us here. The woman squeezes between the clothes chest and the foot of the bed to open the curtains. She stays gazing out at the snow-capped roofs, slowly shreds a basil leaf from Home\u2019s herb tray. Its fresh scent rises through the sickly sweetness that Home breathes out.\nAren\u2019t they supposed to die in the winter? she says.\nHome puts a hand on the woman\u2019s shoulder. He says that they can move somewhere far away, outside the city \u2014 somewhere with a field out the back that smells of soil and wildflowers.\nThere, he says, there I will be able to smoke them out. There will be space.\nShe says she thinks she needs some space. The next day, the woman leaves the flat before dawn.\nHer recipe has been unstuck from beneath its magnet and everything that smelt of the woman and not of honey is gone from the flat. All that is left is a teacup, with a pair of tweezers leaning against its rim.\nHome will wake up with a quiet in his chest and the woman will not read the letter he writes, telling her that we have left.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

It was a little black box with holes poked in on one side to hear the people through.\nI cupped it in my hands and tried to listen, but nothing came out. Dad said it worked, but he needed a special battery to get it going. Something he couldn\u2019t get around here, he said. Something he needed to get from a special friend.\nOne night I stayed awake holding it real tight and trying to make it work by thinking hard, but it never did.\nI put it on the dresser and waited, looking at it sometimes.\nOne day when I was twelve my dad left for a few days. He left me alone in the house while he was gone. I had food and water and everything and I still had the ansible and my dog Buzz, so it was okay.\nThe old man with the green hat who lived on the farm next door came by two times to check up on me, but I told him I was fine both times and he looked at me and mumbled some old man things and went away. I would\u2019ve offered him something to eat, but he had an ear of corn the first time he came and a bag of beef jerky the second, so I didn\u2019t think he was hungry, even though I was.\nBeans were my favorite thing to eat back then and I still like them alright. Back then my dad always got pork and beans in a can. Most of the time he\u2019d buy a dozen cans at a time, which means twelve cans, and sometimes he\u2019d get a \u201cbaker\u2019s dozen\u201d which is thirteen, but I don\u2019t know why they call it that.\nHe\u2019d got a regular dozen for me before he left on his trip, and I\u2019d eaten all twelve cans by the time he came back. I even stacked them up like a pyramid on the kitchen table. I also taught Buzz a trick and looked at all the pictures in a magazine about space about a million times.\nI remember my dad\u2019s face when he came back and saw all the empty cans. His mouth was a big \u201cO\u201d and his eyes were real wide like he couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing. Then he laughed and said he\u2019d have to get a loan from the bank or something just so he could keep feeding me.\nHe was funny like that sometimes, but not all the time. Sometimes he stood outside at night and stared up at the sky with his hands on his hips, not being funny at all.\nI did that too, sometimes, but not like him. When my dad looked at the stars, he looked real serious.\nAfter his joke, my dad sat me down with him and he gave me a wrinkled paper bag and told me to open it up.\nInside was a silver cube \u2014 flat and smooth all around with these neat little symbols on each side. It was warm, too.\nMy dad said he saw his special friend on his trip and that the cube was the battery we needed for the ansible. I ran and got it off the dresser in my room and my dad pried off the cover and put the cube inside.\nAfter it was in we sat and drank 7 UP and waited for nighttime because he said the sun caused problems.\nWhen it was dark, we went outside and sat on the steps and he showed me how to turn the machine on. The holes glowed green and yellow-green when it did. My dad took it and messed with it a little bit, turned it round and round and held it up and touched it in different ways. He said he was calabrayting it.\nHe did that for a while and I watched. I don\u2019t remember if the moon was out, but I wasn\u2019t looking for it.\nThen my dad got real quiet. He held the ansible up to his ear and listened hard. He started whispering some things but he was too quiet and I couldn\u2019t hear what he was saying. Then he said, \u201cOkay. Here he is.\u201d\nI remember exactly those words: \u201cOkay. Here he is.\u201d\nHe gave me the ansible. I held it to my ear and listened.\n\u201cSay something,\u201d my dad told me, so I did. I said, \u201cHello?\u201d \u2014 like on a telephone.\n\u201cBen? Ben, is that you?\u201d\nIt was a woman. I looked at my dad. \u201cIt knows my name,\u201d I said. \u201cI mean, she does.\u201d My dad just nodded and waved his hand real fast which meant that I should hurry up and keep talking.\n\u201cHi,\u201d I said. I didn\u2019t know what else to say. \u201cThis is Ben.\u201d\n\u201cBen,\u201d the woman said. \u201cBen, this is your mother.\u201d\nI laughed then. I don\u2019t know why. I never had a mother, but it felt like a game so I said, \u201cOh, hi mom,\u201d and I told her about my pyramid and the old man next door and how my dad can drink a whole can of 7-UP in five seconds and the woman who said she was my mother laughed and said some other things that I don\u2019t remember and then she started crying.\nShe said she wished so much that she could have watched me grow up, and for some reason I said \u201cyou too\u201d which didn\u2019t make sense and then she started laughing and crying all at the same time.\nEventually my dad took the ansible back and started whispering to her again. He did that until the green-yellow light flickered and went away.\nMy dad looked at the ansible and put his hand on it, like you would touch your dog after it died, then he sighed and stared at the stars for a long time. When he was done, he pried the cover off again and took the silver cube out, which was black now, and threw it into the yard.\nWe never got it working again.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

He\u2019d only wanted a place to sit, where it was dark and cool and quiet.\nHe had looked down with shock to see the small figure on all fours on the ground.\nShe had leather pouches to protect her hands as she crawled, and, this was another shock, high heels attached to the ends of her stumps.\nNow here she is climbing step by step onto the bus. He realizes suddenly that she will have to take the closest seat, next to him.\nHe curses himself for sitting in the first row, knowing as he does that this row attracts all the old ladies needing help with their sacks, women with babies and other annoyances.\nToo late to get up and move, it would look too obvious. She\u2019s already at his feet, and now she\u2019s pointing to the seat and saying something, but her Spanish is all distorted. He sees that her mouth is disfigured as well, the teeth jutting every which way.\nHe\u2019s afraid that she\u2019s asking him to pick her up. Instead, he pats the seat next to him and nods as if to say, \u201cplease sit.\u201d\nThen he looks out the window.\nOut of the corner of his eye, he sees that she\u2019s hoisted herself onto the seat. She smells warm, salty and dusty. He looks out the window again and inches himself as far away from her as possible.\nAt the final stop in town, he sits back and waits as she clambers down. He wonders whether the bus man will help her, as he\u2019d done with the little children who got on with their mothers, picking them up and swinging them easily over the steps.\nShe starts to head down face first, and someone below grabs her like a sack of potatoes and deposits her on the pavement.\nKhoa is relieved, and gets off the bus. Before going back to his room, he stops at the corner comedor with its outdoor table and benches. He orders his usual three carne de res tacos and a cerveza.\nWhen money is low, he resorts to heating a can of soup or a package of instant noodles on his hot plate, but business has picked up lately.\nHe has two television sets waiting to be repaired, and he just finished the radio for Se\u00f1ora Gomez across the courtyard.\nHis room is behind a small gate between two buildings. The gate opens onto a crumbling courtyard with a jacaranda tree and a padlocked outdoor toilet in the center.\nIn his room is a mosquito-netted wooden bed, a desk he\u2019d fashioned from plywood and cement blocks, and a corner alcove with his hotplate, sink and a small patch of tile with a showerhead over it.\nPliers, screwdrivers and wires cover the desk. His pencil drawings are taped to the wall. The television sets, one with a wooden frame and the other with bent antennae, sit in a corner. He\u2019ll have to start working on them in the morning.\nThe night here is cool, deeply dark and silent save for the occasional howling of stray dogs. Khoa washes his feet and gets into bed. Inside the mosquito net, he switches on the reading lamp set next to his pillow.\nHe takes out the letter he started last night. It contains only two lines:\nBac dang o Me. Dung co lo. Your uncle is in Mexico. Don\u2019t worry.\nHe looks at it again, and then folds it up and seals it in the envelope. He flips through his notebook and finds the address for his nephew in San Jose, California.\nThe next morning, before starting work, Khoa walks to the post office to deliver the letter and then decides to stop in the small plaza nearby.\nHe looks to see if the easels have been set up under a shade tree, and sure enough Ruben is there unpacking his paintings from a small dolly.\n\u201cHola Vietnamito!\u201d Ruben has greeted him this way since the first time they met, when he discovered Khoa\u2019s nationality and declared him the first Vietnamese he has ever known.\nHe\u2019d been introduced to the other vendors in the plaza, and they\u2019d all nodded admiringly at the Vietnamitos who\u2019d beat the Yanquis en la guerra in\u00fatil.\n\u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d Khoa had asked. His Spanish was still dictionary-based, though he could understand enough to get by.\n\u201cGuerra in\u00fatil,\u201d Ruben translated, \u201cthe nonsense war.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d Khoa said, \u201cthis I can agree with you about.\u201d He didn\u2019t say more, letting them clap his back and congratulate him on Vietnam\u2019s victory.\n* * *\nIt was true, he\u2019d always thought the war was senseless and mad. Brother against brother, Americans against all of us. But Quang had never thought that way, and they argued about it as law students long ago in Saigon.\n\u201cSo what should we do, lie down and let the Viet Cong take over the country?\u201d Quang asked.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want Communism anymore than you do, but we can\u2019t kill each other like this. We\u2019re one people after all. There has to be a way to negotiate a peace.\u201d\nThey were in a downtown caf\u00e9, drinking Johnny Walker Black because Quang was paying. He always paid on their outings, since he was the son of a well-off publisher while Khoa was a scholarship student with an impoverished, widowed mother.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a dreamer,\u201d Quang scoffed, tossing back his whiskey. \u201cMa thoi, minh la anh em. But never mind, we\u2019re brothers anyway.\u201d\nLater on, in America, Quang still hadn\u2019t given up. They\u2019d lost the war but the consolation prize was worth it, after all, to become residents of the richest, most powerful country in the world.\nIt seemed amazing to Khoa, how someone so fired up to save the Republic of South Vietnam was then able to embrace living as an exile in the country that had let them down.\nHe himself, never much of a patriot, couldn\u2019t get used to the idea that this was now his home and that Vietnam was gone.\nQuang still called him every once in a while on Sundays. They addressed each other as moi et toi, like in their schooldays.\nKhoa envied Quang the certainty with which he seemed to be leading his life.\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s no going back. Those that think so are fooling themselves. Minh phai di cay, thoi. We just have to work, take care of our families, phai khong?\u201d\nQuang did most of the talking on these calls, while Khoa mainly listened. He liked hearing his friend expound, like in the old days, though now they were men nearing fifty.\nHe\u2019d gone once to visit Quang and his family in Los Angeles. It shocked him then, to see their dingy one-bedroom apartment, though he himself was faring no better having only recently arrived in San Jose.\nQuang always sounded so sure of himself, so strong on the phone, and Khoa had imagined him somehow unchanged from their student days. His wife, whom Khoa always thought so lovely and genteel, was working in a nail salon. \u201cSister, you\u2019re as beautiful as ever,\u201d he complimented her shyly.\nAnd the children, three girls who hovered awkwardly in the doorway when he was introduced, he felt sorry for them being stuck in this hot apartment on a summer day.\n\u201cLet me invite your family to Disneyland,\u201d he said impulsively to Quang. \u201cI want to see it myself on my vacation, eh?\u201d\nThe children brightened immediately, forgetting their embarrassment at the stranger and running off to put on their best clothes. Khoa marveled how little it took to make them so happy.\nAt Disneyland they stood in line for the rides, the spinning teacups, the trains and carousels that delighted the children. Khoa paid for all their tickets, and for their hamburgers and French fries as well.\n\u201cThoi di, thoi di,\u201d he waved off Quang\u2019s objections. As the children and their mother got into one of the hanging suspended cars in TomorrowLand, Khoa and Quang climbed into another. Two middle-aged Vietnamese men riding the \u201cpeople-mover,\u201d their white dress shirts and slacks hanging limply from their gaunt bodies.\nHe wondered, without Quang\u2019s family nearby, whether they looked even more out of place at this American theme park.\nThat was the last time he saw Quang.\nHe\u2019d returned to his nephew\u2019s apartment in San Jose, ready to look for work. It had been two years since Duc was able to sponsor him from Vietnam. They were living in the one-bedroom off Tully Road, together with Duc\u2019s new wife Chau.\nDuring this time, Khoa was still taking English classes at the community college. His welfare checks were enough to contribute his modest share of the household\u2019s expenses, with something left over to pay for his cigarettes and the occasional coffee at the Vietnamese caf\u00e9.\nBut Khoa wanted to move out. His room was the living room, which they\u2019d turned into a bedroom with a fold-out couch. The dining room was the communal area where Chau left food for him when he came home late from the caf\u00e9. They never ate together anymore.\nAt first, Chau and Duc argued in their bedroom loud enough for him to hear.\nThen, as tensions mounted in the tiny space, she took to muttering under her breath when he was around, \u201cWhy can\u2019t this old man pay part of the rent? He\u2019s not a refugee anymore.\u201d\nHe\u2019d gone to Duc one morning, after she left for her factory job, with his last two hundred dollars. He could tell his nephew wanted to take the money, but out of respect, wouldn\u2019t let himself.\n\u201cYou\u2019re my uncle, and I can never repay you for helping me get out of Vietnam,\u201d he\u2019d said.\n\u201cAlright, but ask your wife about any jobs at the factory,\u201d Khoa said. He decided to save the money for his own apartment instead. That would make them happier anyway, he reasoned.\nEventually, through Chau\u2019s friends, he did find a job at another factory assembling circuit boards. And some time after that, he moved into his own studio apartment.\n* * *\nRuben taps out a cigarette and offers one to Khoa. They sit together on the bench next to the easels of Ruben\u2019s paintings \u2014 brightly plumed parrots, peasant women with brown skin and colorful skirts.\nKhoa doesn\u2019t care for this type of painting, but then he realizes that his own drawings of guitars, hammocks strung between coconut trees and a moon framed by bamboo leaves, are not much more than a kind of quintessentially Vietnamese romanticism that he used to sketch as a foolish young schoolboy.\n\u201cWe\u2019re old fools,\u201d he says to his friend.\n\u201cSpeak for yourself, Vietnamito,\u201d Ruben answers. \u201cI returned to my country eventually. I knew when it was time to stop wandering in the wilderness.\u201d\nRuben had learned English while studying art in Germany as a foreign student. They spoke in English, which gave Khoa a break from his rudimentary Spanish, though he sometimes wished that his friend had learned French instead.\nAfter the first month had passed, when Khoa returned to the plaza every afternoon to smoke his cigarettes, Ruben asked him, \u201cAre you homesick, my friend?\u201d\nKhoa, surprised at the question, searched his body for the feeling and could come up with nothing.\n\u201cI\u2019ve forgotten what it is to be homesick,\u201d he answered.\n\u201cWhen I was in Germany, every night I went to sleep dreaming that I was home, and I woke up sobbing to realize that I was not,\u201d Ruben continued.\nKhoa laughed. \u201cWhat would I miss? The traffic on the freeway to get to the factory, nothing to look at but the billboards and the McDonalds sign, working and working just to afford to live?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Vietnamito, I\u2019m talking about your country. You are homesick for Vietnam, yes? Why else would you leave the land everyone else tries to get into, to come here with us?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cMy country is gone. It\u2019s a different country now. So what is there to be homesick for?\u201d\n\u201cOkay, Vietnamito. The first Vietnamito in Chiapas! I take your word for it,\u201d Ruben had laughed.\nHis own grandmother had been the first Chinese, escaped from a camp of laborers brought here to build the railroad, or so the story went.\nBecause of this bit of shared Asian blood, Ruben would flash the pale underside of his arm and joke, \u201cSee? Yellow, just like you.\u201d\nBefore he leaves the plaza, he casually asks Ruben, \u201cHave you seen a crippled woman around town? Has no hands and legs?\u201d\nRuben looks up quizzically. \u201cYes, why do you ask?\u201d\n\u201cJust curious. I saw her on the bus.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s Flor, pobrecita. She was born that way, though she\u2019s not a beggar for it. She sells her fans in the market and manages to earn a living for herself.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I will see you here another day, amigo. We all have to earn a living, don\u2019t we,\u201d Khoa says as he walks away from the bench.\nAt noon, he stops in the middle of dismantling the first television and takes another break. Instead of going to the comedor, he walks to a tiny store around the corner and buys a package of instant noodles and some eggs. He puts a small pot of water on his hot plate, empties the packet of seasoning and cracks an egg into the boiling water.\nAll those years in San Jose, surrounded by Vietnamese food, and he hardly remembers eating anything. Now he longs for the chewiness of rice noodles whenever he bites into a dry tortilla, and for a broth flavored with fish sauce.\nHe never cooks rice anymore.\nThat night, he tears a page from his notebook, lays it flat on the desk, and begins to draw.\n* * *\nIt didn\u2019t rain much in San Jose, except during the winter when the rain blew in gusts of cold wind. But he could never smell the rain on the air, about to fall, or the wet earth letting its steam rise, every living thing heaving a great exhalation each afternoon as the monsoon downpour began.\nHe\u2019d started his job at the circuit board factory in winter, driving his used car in the early morning before traffic got bad. Sometimes he arrived before the doors opened, and he would sit on a concrete embankment watching the sky lose its dusky softness and become bleakly bright.\nThere were no restaurants nearby \u2014 nothing was within walking distance in this place where mile after mile was taken up by office parks and warehouses \u2014 so most of the workers either brought their lunch or went outside to line up at the taco truck that faithfully waited for them every day in the parking lot.\nSome of the Vietnamese would occasionally get tacos or a sandwich at the truck, though most of them brought rice from home. Khoa, never remembering to prepare food for himself, ended up in line almost every day with the Mexican and Central American women who worked as janitors at the factory.\n\u201cChicken burrito,\u201d he said to the mustached man in the window. The woman visible through the other window briefly looked up before looking down again at her hands preparing his food.\nKhoa stepped to the side of the line to wait.\nIt took another five minutes of waiting before a foil-wrapped cylinder appeared on the counter. The woman\u2019s eyes flickered toward him, indicating that it was his.\nThe next few days, Khoa began to notice those eyes, how she seldom said anything but would glance up at her husband or at the customer, acknowledge the person and the order, and concentrate her gaze on the small quick movements of her hands.\nThen, placing the paper plate or foil wrapped package on the counter, and another flash of the bright dark eyes. He couldn\u2019t decide if it was more of a summons or an offering.\nHe was at the lunch truck every day, and soon there was a flicker of recognition as well in the glance she gave him. After getting his burrito, instead of going back inside to the lunch room, he sat on the embankment nearby and watched as the Mexican woman worked with her husband.\nThough he couldn\u2019t be sure \u2014 was the mustached man her husband? She didn\u2019t look too young to be his wife, but rather too different.\nThe man \u2014 pudgy-faced and common, taking orders and making change without a glimmer of interest. But even with her downcast gaze and no-less efficient and routine gestures, Khoa imagined a silent coil of sorrows and secrets, deep pools of feeling behind those heavy straight brows and long-lashed eyes.\nShe had inky black hair, coarser and thicker than that of Vietnamese women. It was always tied into a high ponytail, the ends of which waved into a soft curve.\nAt first, it was the eyes that he wanted to capture, the slanting, slightly prominent shape of them and the shine of the pupils. He began sitting down after dinner with a sketch pad and pencil, a cigarette and can of beer on the table.\nHe taped up several drafts of these, and with her eyes looking at him from the wall, he began to trace the outline of the face, the broad high shape of the nose and the long lines of the mouth.\nHe was drawing again for the first time since leaving Vietnam, since the war and the prison camp.\nAfter the rough sketch of the head was done, Khoa realized he couldn\u2019t remember enough just from what he managed to glimpse of her during the half hour at lunch. He would have to buy a small disposable camera, he decided.\nIf he could take a few photos and make prints, he would be able to work with more accuracy. He would be able to study what it was that gave the eyes their subtle and powerful expressiveness.\nKhoa found that if he stood diagonally just behind the taco truck, as the lunch crowd gathered in line, he could aim his camera without being noticed.\nWhen the prints came back, there she was, framed in the window. Bending her head in profile, turning to look at her husband, sometimes even gazing off into the distance, almost expectantly.\n* * *\nKhoa rides the bus to the Sunday market, wondering if Flor will be there. At first, he walks through the length of the market without seeing her. He goes inside the old Dominican church but she isn\u2019t there.\nHe starts to look at the mounds of tomatoes and avocados, thinking he might as well do his grocery shopping. He picks out a few limes and a bunch of cilantro, Vietnamese flavors that he\u2019d been happy to discover were also loved by Mexicans.\nHe is wending his way past the meat stall and grilling stand when he spots her in the middle of the path ahead.\nShe\u2019s planted herself in the center of the narrow dirt thoroughfare, and people jostle their way around her carrying bags of groceries, live turkeys and chickens. On her back is strapped a long basket filled with woven fans. She\u2019s got one in her lap, and is clutching a plastic cup of juice to her chest with her other arm.\nKhoa slows down as he approaches her. He walks past and looks back. Her black hair is braided into two long plaits, with a bright red satin ribbon twined into each braid.\nHe wonders about those ribbons \u2014 who braids her hair, taking the time to weave in the satin ribbon that all the indigenous women wear? Where does she get her fans, strapped sturdily to her back before crawling her way to the market?\nHe had thought about buying a fan from her, but had lacked the nerve once he approached. He doesn\u2019t need a fan, and a few coins are nothing more than empty pity anyway, he says to himself.\nHe had seen much worse among beggars in Saigon, especially in the years after the war. Maimings, bloody bandaged wounds, children with birth defects from Agent Orange.\nAnd she wasn\u2019t a beggar, this Flor. She did her hair and wore high heels even without feet, and somehow this touched him most of all.\nKhoa goes straight back to his room, though it is still only midday. He thinks about getting busy with those televisions, but they are easy jobs and won\u2019t take him long to repair.\nHe takes out a book and considers walking to the plaza to read. Instead, he stands in front of the small mirror above his sink. He can\u2019t remember looking at himself except in cursory inspection each morning to see that his hair was brushed and his face clean after shaving.\nHis hair is thinning on top, though full and wiry on the sides. His big, square-shaped eyeglasses. The large knob in his skinny throat. He\u2019s 57 now. Nguyen Minh Khoa.\nExcept that no had called him that for years, neither in America where he was \u201cBac Khoa\u201d to his nephew and coworkers, nor here, where he is Chino or Vietnamito. He hasn\u2019t been Nguyen Minh Khoa, it seems to him now, since those days as a young man in Saigon, studying to become a lawyer, perched on the edge of everything about to disintegrate yet so sure of his place in the drama.\nInstead, more than twenty years had passed, during which it felt to him like he had drifted from one bewildering circumstance to the next. The four years in the prison camp. After that living with his mother in their old Saigon house, hoarding rations and subsisting on broken rice before she died.\nThen his nephew leaving, the secret planning, the selling of his mother\u2019s gold to buy a spot on a boat. Duc was only 19, all his energy and daring burning for a chance to try his luck at sea, sure that he would make it \u2014 rescued and taken to America, Australia, or Canada, anywhere.\nKhoa could not imagine leaving like that, cramming onto a boat and casting himself on the mercy of fishermen or pirates out on the open sea. He thought it fitting that his nephew, his only immediate relative, be given the chance to carry the family name into a hopeful future.\nFor himself, he could live alone, eat little, smoke much, and hug the shadows of Saigon\u2019s streets, now Ho Chi Minh City.\nWhen Duc wrote to him, many years later, about the possibility of sponsorship and that the United States government was willing to help South Vietnamese veterans with a special visa program, and wouldn\u2019t he want to join his remaining family so that they could help each other make a new life?\nIt hadn\u2019t taken him much to say yes, to submit the paperwork and wait another two years for the exit and entry visas and money to arrive for a plane ticket. By then, Saigon had become a ghost to him and he along with it.\nFamilies survived on care packages from their relatives abroad, hoarding and jealous and vicious toward each other; whispering and spying, afraid of being denounced to the cadre.\nHe managed to fade into the background of it all, passing by unnoticed more or less. He bothered no one, asked for nothing and needed little. He\u2019d expected to be carried through life this way in Vietnam, numbed but also buoyed by the ocean of suffering around him. What else but to survive together?\nHe hadn\u2019t counted on the pain that seeped through him once in America. He remembers something Ruben said the first time they talked about being homesick: \u201cThe worst loneliness is not knowing who you are.\u201d\n* * *\nIt didn\u2019t occur to Khoa to expect anything, not even the barest acknowledgement, from the Mexican Maiden, as he\u2019d begun to call her to himself. Co Gai Me.\nSo the day that she smiled suddenly, almost involuntarily, when she saw him appear at the front of the line, quickly looking down again, he was stunned. He abruptly turned away, forgetting to order, and wandered back to the embankment to sit.\nBy this time, he had dozens of drawings of her. In his notebook, the Maiden had taken on an entire life of her own. He had framed her face, exquisitely detailed from the lowered thick lashes to the mole on her cheek, with two slender hands holding a porcelain cup of tea to her lips.\nPerched at the taco truck window, leaning on her elbows, he\u2019d transported her view to that of the Song Huong River, wide and meandering with the sun shimmering on its surface and tropical fronds on its banks.\nAfter the smile, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to face her in line again. Just to utter the brusque order, \u201cchicken burrito,\u201d and have her serve his food seemed all wrong somehow.\nShe didn\u2019t belong in the lunch truck of his factory day, but in the beautiful drawings where her eyes were free to fill with every emotion he could think of.\nHe longed to see her outside of the truck, beyond the narrow formica counter and sliding-glass window that enclosed her. How did the rest of her move \u2014 like the graceful, quick gestures of her upper body or swaying and sensual as she walked? Was she tall or short? Thick-waisted or willowy?\nHe found himself waiting until the end of the lunch hour, wondering why he had never noticed when the truck arrived and when it left the parking lot. As it turned out, as soon as the last trickle of customers disappeared, the Maiden and her husband began cleaning up to go.\nThe husband climbed into the driver\u2019s seat, and the Maiden stepped outside to shut and secure the metal awning propped over the display case. She had on a colorful skirt and ruffled apron, cheap black sandals on her feet.\nKhoa rushed toward his own car, parked in the employee spaces a few feet away. He hurriedly turned on the ignition and backed out quickly. The truck was already pulling onto the street, which way would it turn at the light? When he got to the light and could see it lumbering along Stevenson, his breath began to slow. His heart, however, kept pounding.\nThe truck was headed toward the freeway. He followed up the ramp and stayed in the right lane a few cars behind. It was exiting on Tully \u2014 his street! He was breathless again as he drove cautiously after the truck through several turns off Tully.\nFinally it pulled to the curb on a short street taken up by beige stucco, two-story buildings. He watched as they climbed out of the truck and headed toward the apartment complex, disappearing down a path on the far side of it.\nHe pulled over and parked. So they were going home, and this was where she lived, a setting not unlike that of the drab boxy buildings of his neighborhood a few streets away.\nHe got out of the car and walked slowly toward where he had seen them disappear. Unconsciously, he fingered the Kodak tucked in the pocket of his windbreaker.\nWhich apartment was it? He walked along the side path that ran next to the first floor units, listening for sounds within. A few of the window blinds were open. He stepped up to one screen to peer inside, then another.\nThen he heard a screen door slam, he leaned against the edge of the wall and peeked around the corner. There was a wide sliding glass window next to the door, shaded by some bushes. He ran to one side of that window and, shielded by the bush, looked inside.\nThere she is, walking quickly across the living room and through a door which she closes behind her. The husband is nowhere in sight. Khoa takes in the sofa upholstered in flowery fabric, a formica card table in front of it.\nAn altar with the Virgin, and a calendar from Dong\u2019s Supermarket hanging next to it. He hears water running, and walks around the other side of the wall. There\u2019s a small screened window high up, just two narrow oblongs with the sliding door open.\nKhoa hurries back to the side alley where he\u2019d seen a small dumpster, lifts the lid and looks inside for anything that will hold his weight. There\u2019s nothing but smelly plastic bags overflowing with garbage. He wonders for a feverish second if the dumpster itself can be rolled over with a minimum of noise, but realizes that\u2019s impossible.\nHe crosses back to the front screen door, checks quickly inside and around, and without even having to think, he\u2019s opening the door, in two strides he\u2019s in the living room, picks up the card table and is out the door again.\nWhen he is up and balancing on the table, gripping the bumpy wall with both palms, his eyes try to adjust to the dimness inside the black net screen. It takes him a moment, then his breath stops. The sound of rushing water fills his ears, blocking out everything else.\nHe is looking down at the glistening top of her head, the hair flattened and streaming down her back. A pulse of desire, warm and immediate in spite of himself, flashes through him. His breath comes shallow in anticipation of what he will see.\nShe turns below him, letting the water reach her body. He sees a wet brown shape of curves, his pulse beating a steady drum. Then as his gaze begins to clear, he notices the breasts sagging, the large brown nipples mottled.\nThere are long striations on her curving belly and hips, the marks of childbearing. He sees other details, the blunt broad toes and roughened heels of her feet, her hardworking feet that stand all day in the taco truck.\nHer eyes are closed, she runs her hands down each side of her head and over her face, holding them there as her shoulders hunch and her head bends down.\nMesmerized now and awed by the pureness of this intimacy, he reaches in his pocket for the camera and lifts it. He has to manually rewind the film before each shot, and his thumb automatically pushes back the ridged black dial.\nAll the way back, near the end of the roll. The sound of the dial turning, click, click, click, doesn\u2019t even register with him. But she stops moving, looks around, then up.\nHer eyes meet his, through the window screen she is staring directly at him. There is that split second of instant recognition \u2014 she knows who he is, the man from the lunch line.\nAnd in between the moment of recognition and the moment her face contorts and then breaks apart into pure terror, he is falling, falling and the screams falling with him as he stumbles up from the ground and crashes through the alley.\n* * *\nNight after night, Khoa looks at her face and body. He doesn\u2019t have to see the real woman anymore to remember the likeness. On his desk he grows familiar again with her features, and they are more beautiful to him with each rendering.\nWhen his notepaper and pencil become too limiting, the sketches mastered, he goes to Ruben and asks to trade his smallest canvas and the use of some paints in return for a clock radio that someone has left behind.\nWith the utmost care on a tiny brush, Khoa mixes the colors bringing her to life. It is only the color and the light of her he sees now as he paints.\nHe is painting this portrait for himself, yet when it is done, he knows he will not keep it.\nHe will take it to the marketplace, and there he will ask Flor to give him a fan in return.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

But the sight of them, colorful and glossy in a clear glass bowl on the counter of the unisex bathroom, made her feel oddly nostalgic. They held her the way sunlight grazing the glass surface of a full gumball machine had held her as a child. Her mouth began to water.\nThere were so many. Would they ever run out? I want one. Her hand twitched.\nWithout another thought, she plunged her fist straight into the bowl with such enthusiasm that her knuckles struck the bottom and forced several condoms out onto the counter. She wiggled her fingers until she settled on one. The round, rubber ring of the condom slid around inside its plastic wrapper as she closed her hand around it. Giddy, she tucked the condom into the cavernous pocket of her raincoat and fled.\nAs she returned to the apartment she shared with Chet, practical questions emerged. Where would she store the condom? What would she do with it? How would she explain it to Chet? They hadn\u2019t used condoms in years. So why did she have it?\nFor the next week, Angel obsessed about the condom\u2019s whereabouts, especially relative to Chet\u2019s whereabouts. She moved it around several times a day. She tried a shoebox on the top rack of the closet and the back of a drawer full of nails and appliance manuals.\nWhenever she imagined Chet finding it, harsh words and spit flying, she imagined herself flustered, face burning, unable to explain. Panicked, she would scramble to find a better hiding place. And as she overturned pillows and reconfigured the contents of the kitchen cupboards, she began to wonder why she was so afraid? It was just an impulse, she told herself. Nothing more.\nAfter a week of hiding the condom around the apartment, she decided it had to go.\n* * *\n\u201cKeep me,\u201d Angel heard as she approached the trashcan of a nearby park. Her eyes scrambled about for a face to match the voice, but the park was empty. Her heart began to pound so intensely the contents of her ribcage rattled.\nShe looked down at the condom. \u201cKeep me,\u201d she heard it say.\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking,\u201d she whispered.\n\u201cKeep me,\u201d the condom repeated. \u201cYou want to.\u201d\n* * *\n\u201cMy name is Geoffrey,\u201d he told her when they were alone in her car.\n\u201cAre you really talking or am I imagining this?\u201d Angel glanced around the dark carport to make sure no one else was there.\n\u201cI\u2019m really talking,\u201d the condom explained.\nThe voice was deep and resonant as it expanded into the stale air of the car. She imagined an Adam\u2019s apple rolling beneath the velvety skin of a man\u2019s neck when he swallowed. She imagined him looking into her eyes intently. And she suppressed a shiver.\n\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d\n\u201cEverything is possible,\u201d he winked. \u201cYou know that.\u201d\n\u201cNot this,\u201d she laughed and shook her head.\n\u201cHave it your way,\u201d he shrugged.\n* * *\n\u201cTell me something you\u2019ve never told anyone,\u201d Geoffrey said.\nThey were in Angel\u2019s parked car again and she was resting her bare feet on the steering wheel while Geoffrey balanced on her left knee cap.\nShe thought for awhile. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything.\u201d\n\u201cTell me about your first date then.\u201d\n\u201cIt was with Chet. In high school.\u201d\n\u201cAnd?\u201d he prodded.\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d she said, trying to recall the name of the movie.\n\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Geoffrey cocked his head to one side and raised an eyebrow.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry if that wasn\u2019t interesting enough for you.\u201d She tossed her hair and imagined him watching her.\n\u201cWas it interesting enough for you?\u201d\nShe felt her stomach lurch and a stinging feeling of an unpleasant memory began to swell within her. Geoffrey sat patiently as if he already knew what she would say.\n\u201cAbout a year earlier,\u201d she began slowly, \u201ca boy asked for my phone number.\u201d\n\u201cCan you blame him?\u201d Geoffrey touched her cheek.\nAnd her eyes filled with tears.\n\u201cTell me why you\u2019re crying,\u201d\nShe imagined Geoffrey reclining, ankles crossed, gazing at her sweetly.\n\u201cI was really excited to tell my mother that a guy asked for my number,\u201d she began. \u201cI expected her to be proud. She always wanted to know who I liked and encouraged me to look as attractive as possible around him. She recommended fad diets. I thought the whole point was to get a guy\u2019s attention. When I told her, she was washing dishes at the sink and had her back to me. But when she turned around, her face looked so hard, like it was about to crack. She asked a few questions about him and I told her what I knew, which wasn\u2019t much. Because I wasn\u2019t really interested in him. I was just doing what I thought she wanted me to do.\u201d\nAngel could feel the grainy skin of Geoffrey\u2019s fingertips stroking her wrist.\n\u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cThen,\u201d her voice cracked. \u201cShe called me a slut. Because I gave a boy my phone number.\u201d Tears cascaded over her jaw, down her neck and into the crevices of her collarbone. She dropped her chin to her chest.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Geoffrey said. And she imagined his arms snug around her, the warm air circulating between her open mouth and his bare neck, her runny nose darkening his collar with streaks of snot.\nAngel sniffled. \u201cThere\u2019s more.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m still listening,\u201d Geoffrey whispered.\n\u201cI was so stunned and embarrassed that I turned to walk away from her. But before I could take a step, something smacked me in the back of my head. I heard a loud bang as it hit the floor.\u201d\nShe pressed her face firmly into the skin of Geoffrey\u2019s neck as the bristles of his stubble imprinted on her balmy forehead. He cupped the back of her head with his large palm. She could hear the crunch of her hair giving way to his fingers.\n\u201cIt was a bottle of dish soap,\u201d Angel sobbed. \u201cAnd then she called me a slut again.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a slut,\u201d Geoffrey said.\n\u201cI know that now,\u201d Angel wiped her tears with the back of her hand. Then she added, \u201cBut I married the first guy I dated just to show her that I wasn\u2019t.\u201d\nThey sat in silence for awhile.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never told anyone that before,\u201d Angel confessed.\n\u201cNot even Chet?\u201d\n\u201cNot even Chet.\u201d\n* * *\n\u201cWho named you Geoffrey?\u201d Angel mused as she traced the letters on the surface of Geoffrey\u2019s wrapper while he reclined against the mound of her thumb. She imagined him moaning softly on his exhale. They were parked in their usual spot.\n\u201cI did,\u201d Geoffrey said. \u201cWho named you Angel?\u201d She heard the rustle of his jeans against the taut fabric of the passenger seat as he turned toward her and leaned closer.\n\u201cMy mother.\u201d\n\u201cWhat would you have named yourself?\u201d\nAngel nearly snorted. \u201cWhat a silly question! Why does it matter?\u201d\n\u201cWhy does it matter what someone else named you?\u201d\nShe shrugged. \u201cYou have a point. But I like my name. Who doesn\u2019t like angels?\u201d\n\u201cI love angels.\u201d Geoffrey\u2019s voice vibrated softly. She felt the jagged callouses of his palm scuff her knuckles as he covered her hand with his and slowly interlaced their fingers. The heat of his touch crawled up her arm like a vine.\n\u201cIf only I was one,\u201d her voice broke suddenly.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d Geoffrey probed. She could feel the humidity of his breath as he looked down at her, lips slightly parted to reveal the bumpy, white bottoms of his two front teeth. She imagined his tongue, hovering just behind them, coarse and damp.\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten so many conflicting messages,\u201d Angel sighed as Geoffrey hummed lightly, stroking her ear, then her jaw, fingertips grazing her neck. \u201cIt\u2019s all so confusing,\u201d she sniffled.\n\u201cWhat part?\u201d\n\u201cAll of it. I\u2019m an angel. I\u2019m a slut. I\u2019m talking to a condom.\u201d\n\u201cYes, no, maybe so. But nobody else can tell you what you are.\u201d\n* * *\n\u201cAre you cheating on me?\u201d Chet demanded, banging his open palms against the table.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Angel said firmly.\n\u201cThen who the hell is Geoffrey?\u201d\n\u201cI already told you. This is Geoffrey,\u201d she motioned toward the condom lying on the table between them.\nChet snorted in annoyance. \u201cAnd why did you name him that?\u201d\n\u201cHe named himself.\u201d\n\u201cPlease be serious.\u201d Chet\u2019s voice was stern, the wrinkles around his eyes looked more entrenched than usual.\n\u201cI know it sounds crazy. But I promise I\u2019m not cheating on you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you carrying around a condom then?\u201d\nShe held her breath.\n\u201cWere you thinking about cheating on me?\u201d\n\u201cProbably not?\u201d\nChet rolled his eyes. \u201cAnd then the condom started talking to you?\u201d\nAngel nodded enthusiastically.\n\u201cRidiculous,\u201d he groaned wearily. And then a moment later: \u201cBut I believe you.\u201d\n\u201cYou do?\u201d She squeaked and sat upright, feeling a surge of gratitude.\n\u201cI believe that you\u2019re not cheating on me,\u201d he pushed his chair back from the table. \u201cBut I don\u2019t believe the condom is talking to you. You need help.\u201d\nChet rose and started to turn away.\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Angel resisted the urge to grab for his arm.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have anything more to say.\u201d His back was to her now.\n\u201cBut I do,\u201d she said as assertively as she could.\n* * *\n\u201cDoes Chet know about me?\u201d Geoffrey had asked one afternoon.\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Angel had snapped back at him. \u201cHow would I explain this?\u201d\n\u201cJust tell him the truth.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know what that is.\u201d\n\u201cI think you do,\u201d he nudged her shoulder gently.\nShe leaned closer to him and inhaled the distinct scent of his aftershave. \u201cGeoffrey,\u201d she said a few minutes later. \u201cI love you.\u201d\nGeoffrey didn\u2019t answer.\n* * *\n\u201cGo on.\u201d Chet\u2019s voice was sharp. He was standing beside the table now, arms crossed over his broad chest.\n\u201cI just need a minute.\u201d\nShe scooped up Geoffrey in both palms and turned away from Chet.\n\u201cGeoffrey,\u201d she raised her hands to her face and whispered to the condom. \u201cPlease. Just talk to me one more time. I can\u2019t do this without you.\u201d\nShe stared down at the crinkled plastic, scuffed now.\n\u201cYou can take it from here,\u201d she thought she heard it say.\n\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d She turned to Chet abruptly.\n\u201cYou begged a condom to talk to you.\u201d Chet frowned. \u201cPlease get on with this.\u201d\nShe looked back at Geoffrey. \u201cYou can take it from here,\u201d she heard again. But it wasn\u2019t Geoffrey\u2019s voice this time. It was her own. She dropped the condom and turned back to Chet.\n\u201cI want a divorce,\u201d she announced.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

And you begin to smile, eyes crinkled up with laughter at the stupidity of you, your friend.\nHaven\u2019t we grown? Are we not still children?\nBut suddenly, as if feeling itself in your thoughts, the creature moves.\nIt cocks its head slowly, once to the side, then to the other. As if it\u2019s observing you, listening to your heart, because in that moment of first movement, your heart patters oddly in your chest, just once: a little skip behind the ribs.\nYou grin hard then. With something childlike churning in the muscles of your mind. Think to yourself, Well that\u2019s creepy. And then you chuckle, say it out loud, laughing. But the creature only bends its head one way, then the other.\nYou become aware of that ball of spit in your throat, refusing to slip down. And you back up once without meaning to. You bump the coffee table. The creature fixates on your location, and a few stretched seconds pass while a bead of sweat slips down your chest.\nIt lunges.\nQuick but stumbling, it rushes you and something inside some crevice of you reacts \u2014 make you jump away, breathing hard, teeth chattering with chuckles and something else.\nYou say aloud, \u201cJesus man, that\u2019s freaky!\u201d\nAnd this sick kind of laughter comes tumbling down to your feet, as you shake in your new spot, chest heaving.\nYou expect your friend to answer, but they don\u2019t. Instead this covered creature, still and waiting, now turns slowly towards the sound of you, and pads toward you again. Slowly. Frame by frame.\nUntil it\u2019s a foot away and your heart is quick and this primal fear, sharp and sudden, strikes you at your core, as this creature lunges at you again \u2014 and you again spring away but this time it was closer. Too close for your liking, so you stop laughing stop smiling tell the creature to stop \u2014\nBut it stays as it is. Lying in wait all still and silent as it listens to your heart and your breath spilling out and over you in cacophonous rhythm until it lunges again as you try to insist it\u2019s not funny anymore seriously.\nBut you don\u2019t know this new creature \u2014 you don\u2019t know if it has a mind of its own or if its creation left it only instinct, when all it does is make you dance heart pounding madly \u2014\nBut you call out one last time to this creature,your voice bent up with something that isn\u2019t quite human either, STOP.\nTime itself will freeze.\nYou\u2019ll watch the creature stand upright with new legs. It\u2019ll be the size of you.\nThe blanket will begin to slip, and you\u2019ll wonder if there was a time that you knew what was beneath it.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

An ideal spot for escalator kayaking and parkour, Shoppingtown also attracts artists of the graffitti trade as well as local bands looking for a place to have a moody photo shoot.\nParking is free and ample and visitors need never worry about ghosts haunting the dim corridors and musky pink-tiled bathrooms, as there isn\u2019t enough spirit in the whole of the city to entice even one finger of any self-respecting phantom.\nThat\u2019s because, though everything is disposable in Shoppingtown, nothing really dies.\nThe backwards R in the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us sign glows forever in memory.

Your mind wanders at a slow and careful pace. Too fast and you\u2019ll start to want things. You forbid yourself from wanting things (or ever really considering gardens).\nYes, it\u2019s boring. Difficult. Slow. But you know what it\u2019s like here. You don\u2019t ever worry about what people are going to do to you.\nTwo.\nHe asks why you called on him. You find that funny, in a way. You\u2019re sitting alone in pitch darkness. He knows why. He just wants to hear you say it. Admit it.\nYou tell him about your tendency to burst into flowers. You tell him the darkness hasn\u2019t seemed to help you along. You tell him you wish you could stop.\nHe has a pencil and a clipboard and a little pin light to help him see his papers. It\u2019s almost blinding, even though you are staring at his polished leather dress shoes. It\u2019s the first color you have seen in years. Brown. You think of mountain ranges and trees and skin.

After that, it was quieter at home, and I saw Dad every second weekend.\nHe gave me the jigsaw puzzle the first weekend of the school holidays \u2014 a pride of lions lounging on the African savannah. I could hear the roar of the male from inside the box. I suppose Dad meant for me to put it together while he hung out with his new girlfriend, but I was a little scared of it, with all the roaring coming from inside.\nMum said five hundred pieces was too many for me, and what had my father been thinking? She said that about his girlfriend too, who chewed bubble gum and had a tattoo of Pikachu on her left arm. When I told her she should ask Dad instead of me, she snorted.\n\u201cYour father doesn\u2019t think. I suppose I\u2019ll have to help you put it together,\u201d she added.\nBut I shut my door and refused help\u2014lions were dangerous. I didn\u2019t want Mum to get hurt.\nI knew the lions wouldn\u2019t harm me, because I was a kid. Maybe I\u2019d nestle in among the sleeping cubs and they\u2019d take me in as one of their own. What would it be like to be raised by lions? I was pretty sure daddy lions didn\u2019t come home smelling like beer and shouting at everyone. And I knew mummy lions caught fresh wildebeest, instead of pulling out stale crackers and Marmite for lunch.\nI separated out the border pieces \u2014 peacock-blue sky and dusty brown grass, perfect for concealing the tawny cats \u2014 and framed out the edges of the puzzle.\nAt lunchtime, I asked Mum how wildebeest tasted.\n\u201cWildebeest? Why would you want to eat wildebeest? Try not to get crumbs on the carpet, dear.\u201d She swept up the bits of cracker I\u2019d dropped.\nI put together Mama cat first. Her haunches, tail, furry paws, and the stiff whiskers framing her face. I set in the final piece of her and her black-tipped tail twitched. She purred when I scratched her head.\n\u201cSweetie. Dinnertime,\u201d Mum called.\nI removed a piece of paw, just in case, and went to eat.\nThe cubs were next. It was hard to tell where one spotted body ended and another began. The first one I finished mewed for its brothers.\n\u201cAre you okay in there darling?\u201d\nI shushed the cub by tickling it under the chin. \u201cAll good, Mum.\u201d\nThe finished cubs squirmed and tumbled together, mock-fighting. But they had no space to play. I focused on the savannah for a while. I made them a wide field of sparse grass full of grasshoppers to chase and a spreading acacia tree for shade under a blue sky.\nAfter Mum tucked me into bed and turned out the light, I had to tiptoe to the puzzle and take out a few pieces. The cubs were making so much noise, I couldn\u2019t sleep.\nLater, a sound that wasn\u2019t the cubs woke me. I knew what the pounding on the door meant. His voice rattled my window as he bellowed for Mum. Her slippered footsteps pattered on the steps, and I silently pleaded for her not to let him in. I pressed the pillow over my ears so I couldn\u2019t hear.\nMum slept in the next day. When she poked her head into my room, still in her bathrobe, dark rings circled her eyes. She pointed to the puzzle.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten so much done! The only thing left is daddy lion.\u201d\nBut I didn\u2019t put him together. Not yet. I was a little afraid of him. Instead I spent the day playing with the cubs. I tumbled with them under the hot sun until I was dusty and covered in scratches. Then we piled in a heap to sleep off the heat of the day \u2014 it\u2019s very hot on the African savannah.\n\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d Mum exclaimed when I came down to dinner that evening. \u201cIt looks like you\u2019ve been wrestling tigers!\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cLions, actually.\u201d\nShe wasn\u2019t happy about the state of my room either. \u201cWhat have you been up to? Looks like a herd of elephants came through here.\u201d\n\u201cLions, actually.\u201d\nI piled the cubs on my bed that night and we nestled together under the covers. Mama lion didn\u2019t mind, but I was a little worried about the fur on my pillow in the morning. I brushed it off so Mum wouldn\u2019t see it.\nNext day I put together the daddy lion. Almost. I left one piece out. I was still a little afraid.\nWhen Mum came in, she bent over the puzzle. \u201cThere\u2019s only one piece left.\u201d She reached out to slot it into place.\n\u201cNo!\u201d I clapped my hand over hers. \u201cYou can\u2019t let the daddy out.\u201d I didn\u2019t think I had to explain why.\nShe frowned at me, and then shut her eyes for a moment. When she opened them, her face was twisted into a strange smile. She ruffled my hair. \u201cYou have such an imagination!\u201d\nFor a week, I slept with the cubs at night and played with them by day. On Friday night, when Dad threw a rock through Mum\u2019s bedroom window, Mama cat jumped onto the bed and gave us tongue baths. It tickled and smelled funny, but I wasn\u2019t scared with her there. She sat watch all night, and the next two nights, too.\nMum grumbled every time she came into my room. \u201cI can barely walk through here with that big puzzle on the floor.\u201d\nThe next day was a school day. I made sure to take out a few puzzle pieces before I left. I didn\u2019t think Mum would be very happy to find claw marks on the furniture.\nAt school, I told the teacher I had lions in my room. She said not to tell lies.\nWhen I got home, Mum was in a bad mood. She made me tidy my room.\n\u201cAnd put away that puzzle if you\u2019re not going to finish it.\u201d\nI stood looking at the puzzle for a long time. The cubs were asleep and Mama cat was cleaning a paw. The sun shone brightly, and grasshoppers buzzed in the grass. Daddy lion \u2014 still unfinished and frozen \u2014 watched over his children. His ears looked soft, and his eyes were alert, but not fierce. He didn\u2019t look like the sort of daddy to throw rocks and hit people. I crouched and slipped the last piece into place. Daddy lion shook his mane and licked Mama lion\u2019s face before turning amber eyes to me.\nHe blinked slowly. An ear twitched, as if beckoning.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

I knew him . . .\n\u2014William Shakespeare\nTo the outside world Jerry Farelli appeared to have everything life could offer: good looks, excellent health, and substantial wealth (albeit derived from a number of dubious enterprises).\nYet happiness still eluded him, because his prized collection of celebrity skulls lacked the cranium of his favorite actor\u2014Telly Savalas.\nWhile he did own, at considerable expense, a lollipop once licked by the thespian during an early episode of \u201cKojak,\u201d without the mandible that had held it in place, it only served as a bitter reminder of the significant hole in his cache of trophies and thus in his life.\nUltimately, he regarded it as an orphaned artifact, referring to it as \u201cpop-prop\u201d during bouts of gloom over his failure to crown his extensive trove of noggins.\nSurrounding the felt-lined space he had set aside (in vain) for the Savalas skull were the domes of several other television luminaries, which were the envy of many collectors.\nLooking at the orbs of stars from one-time shows such as \u201cHollywood Squares,\u201d \u201cFantasy Island,\u201d \u201cThree\u2019s Company,\u201d and a dozen others, helped ease his melancholy to some degree, and the head of champion yodeler Gaston Plantiff, the 2019 winner of \u201cAmerican Idolatry,\u201d who had died of a drug overdose a week after his amazing ascent to world fame, really ramped up his spirits.\nBut his joy was short-lived when his eyes fell on the hollow reserved for Savalas.\nFrom an early age, Jerry had been a great admirer of the bald actor, watching endless reruns of his popular detective show on the Felony Channel, and downloading the actor\u2019s movies. Among his favorite Savalas film roles were Archer Maggott in \u201cThe Dirty Dozen\u201d and Sergeant Tibbs in \u201cMcKenna\u2019s Gold.\u201d\nHe had watched both movies countless times, and they had greatly fanned his desire to acquire the actor\u2019s head. Yet this had seemed an impossible dream to Jerry until, one day, a dealer informed him that the skull had been placed on the market by the actor\u2019s estate.\nIts sudden availability surprised Jerry, since his frequent inquiries about it over the years had always led nowhere, but his excitement about its possible acquisition overrode his wariness.\nHe was well aware of the black market in celebrity skulls, and had used it for other things, but when it came to his special collection of bones he had intentionally avoided illegal purchases \u2014 though he had been tempted on more than one occasion.\nAs much as he had wanted the Savalas skull, he had steered clear of underground head hawkers as a matter of principle. His collection was the one area in his life that he insisted on total legitimacy and integrity.\nNow a familiar vendor of solid reputation had offered the skull to Jerry and his mood was quickly transformed by the prospect of finally adding it to his already formidable holdings. It represented the diamond in the tiara of his beloved display, and he was already planning a party to commemorate its installation.\nBy the time the news about the Savalas skull made its way to the Celebrity Memorabilia Channel, Jerry had purchased it for a sum that even he momentarily balked at.\nYet he had to have it, at any cost, and now it would be his.\nHe made arrangements to have it delivered to his house in Bel Air the next day, then spent the remainder of the afternoon and evening twitting and skekking his friends about the banner acquisition, and talking with the caterer about the food and drink for the celebration two days hence.\nHis girlfriend was still away in the Honduras on a spelunking vacation with her women\u2019s group, so she would miss the gala event, which Jerry did not want to delay until her return.\nThat night the excitement over the Savalas head kept him awake until sunrise, at which point he arose and sat before the space that would soon be occupied by one of his greatest television and film heroes.\nThe time moved slowly until the hour the dealer was expected arrived and then passed. Jerry waited 15 minutes before texting the dealer but there was no response.\nAfter three more text messages the dealer responded, informing Jerry that he had decided against selling the Savalas skull until he felt the seller was getting the most he could for it.\n\u201cSelling it now may be a bit premature, and I have an obligation to the sellers to get the most for them. I hope you understand,\u201d he explained to Jerry, who was not having any of it.\nHe immediately doubled his already exorbitant offer but it was to no avail; he felt duped, it incensed him, and he threatened legal action against the dealer, who reminded him that no contract had been signed and no money had exchanged hands.\nJerry\u2019s mood darkened as he contemplated the embarrassment of having to call off the party after having declared to everyone that he possessed the coveted skull \u2014 a singular triumph in his exclusive circle of aficionados.\nThe longer he thought about his situation, the more angry and distraught he became. It was in this overwrought state that Jerry decided to take action into his own hands.\nHe made a call to a certain someone \u2014 an expert in problem resolution, is how Jerry thought of him.\nHe would have the dealer beheaded and the fleshy member dipped in an acid bath to remove everything from the skeleton. He would then place the skull in the space reserved for Savalas in time for the gathering. That way he would save face, even though the dealer would lose his, chuckled Jerry, musing that the dealer even looked like the actor.\nIt all seemed like poetic justice.\nBy noon the next day the dealer\u2019s skull was duly delivered to Jerry, and he quickly placed it in the awaiting space, inserting the sucker between its jaws. No one would be the wiser, he thought, as he stood back and surveyed the display.\nAfter the party he would make every effort to obtain the actual Savalas skull, and he would do so even if it meant lopping off a few more heads. He would not be denied this prize, whatever it cost, as he could not abide the false skull in his collection for very long.\nBy 8 p.m. the following evening more than one hundred people, among them some of the foremost collectors in the region, filled Jerry\u2019s skultorium as he unveiled the main attraction to loud applause and cheers.\nWhile the crowd ogled the actor\u2019s would be skull, Jerry\u2019s girlfriend, Jenna, suddenly appeared two days ahead of her scheduled return. This delighted Jerry and he and the crowd redirected their attention to her.\n\u201cThe trip ended early, and here I am,\u201d she announced and then handed Jerry a box covered in wrapping paper and bows.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d asked Jerry taking the box from her.\n\u201cA surprise. Something I know you wanted big time,\u201d she answered, as he torn open the brightly decorated package.\nInside was a skull, which Jerry held in his hand for everyone to see.\n\u201cGuess who it is,\u201d asked his girlfriend.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not Telly Savalas, because he\u2019s over there,\u201d replied Jerry joking and nodding in the direction of the display.\nAfter a long perplexed silence, Jerry\u2019s girlfriend spoke. \u201cActually, it is Telly Savalas. I bought it for you from the dealer.\n\u201cThat can\u2019t be. He said he wasn\u2019t selling \u2026 \u201d replied Jerry, catching himself too late and knowing he had let the cat out of the bag \u2014 and thus raised the suspicion of his fellow collectors.\n\u201cBecause I told him I wanted to buy it for you as a belated birthday present. I contacted all the dealers a while back to tell me if the skull became available and he forgot until after he talked to you. Then he called me and we made up the story about his not wanting to sell it,\u201d said Jenna looking at the cranium in the area reserved for the Savalas piece. \u201cSo whose skull is that?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, Jerry, what skull is that?\u2019 repeated several people at the gathering.\n\u201cYou trying to pull something over on us?\u201d chimed others.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. There has to be some mistake,\u201d replied Jerry defensively. \u201cLook, let\u2019s call it a night and let me get to the bottom of this.\u201d\nWhen Jerry and his girlfriend were alone, he asked for more details about the purchase, which revealed she had, indeed, acquired the skull from the dealer whose head now graced his display.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Jenna asked and Jerry claimed he was as confused as she was.\nWhen they were in bed, she tried to interest Jerry in lovemaking, but he was unresponsive, claiming an upset stomach.\nHis thoughts were focused on the calamity of the last few hours and he lay awake for several hours until the doorbell rang. Greeting him were several police officers who arrested him on the spot for the murder of the dealer.\nHis hired hit man had been stopped for driving under the influence and the murder weapons were found in his car. In his inebriated state he had made a full confession.\n\u201cThat\u2019s crazy!\u201d protested Jerry as he was led away.\n\u201cYou got that right,\u2019 buddy,\u201d replied the cop escorting him to the waiting cruiser.\nThe Internet was soon filled with the sordid details of the notorious crime for which Jerry was sentenced to 40 years in the state penitentiary. His infamy grew as speculation about the origins of his other skulls came into question, and the irony was not lost on Jerry since it was the one area of his life he had kept uncorrupted.\nHe was soon labeled the \u201cBel Air Decapitator\u201d by the media and NBC\u2019s \u201cDeathline\u201d (formerly \u201cDateline\u201d) devoted an entire two-hour episode to his case further fanning his notoriety.\nFive years into his sentence, Jerry was slain by a fellow inmate and his body was buried in the prison cemetery \u2014 though without its head.\nBy this point the market for skulls of famous criminals had exploded and Jerry\u2019s skull fetched an impressive sum. The prominent collector who purchased it proudly placed it between his skulls of Jeffrey Dalmer and John Wayne Gacy.\nThe head of Telly Savalas was returned to his estate, which claimed it had never authorized its sale, although given its tremendously increased value it was now considering doing so to fund a planned Las Vegas museum devoted to the renowned performer.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Limber pines reach high into the gloom like animals on their hind legs, and now the annex looming up with its moss-bearded brick is larger \u2014 colossally \u2014 and surely older than the gleaming hospital that\u2019s shrunk to a pinprick of light on the path behind her.\nShe\u2019s dreaming maybe, fallen asleep somehow between hospital and annex, everything its own opposite since the ability to sleep stood up and ran away from her.\nCelia\u2019s nights are days now \u2014 wide-eyed, scream-mouthed days spent staring at the bedroom ceiling \u2014 and her days are just hell. Her stumbling, fumbling life. Dream on, princess.\nNo, she\u2019s awake on her feet.\nIt\u2019s like you\u2019re asleep on your feet. Jared\u2019s voice, like their marriage, had altered at some point, cut up by rust, wet brakes grinding. You should get it checked out. You were never clumsy when I knew you. The oddness of his word choice had made Celia frown at him. I mean when I met you.\nSleep is food, babe.\nWhen you\u2019re starving it\u2019s all you think about.\nYou\u2019re home during the day now. You could take naps.\nYou could try harder.\nFrom their teenage sons lately even less verbiage, only the exasperated Mom when she drops things, forgets their appointments.\nAnd Celia\u2019s doctor, large-headed, mansplaining, at his very oak desk: Impossible, that\u2019s a layman\u2019s myth. His lips like baloney. No one doesn\u2019t sleep.\nThe door to the sleep-lab annex stands open. At the threshold she trips on a broken flagstone and almost falls in, catching herself with a little dance, a choreography of exhaustion.Inside, at least, it\u2019s hospital-looking.\nA man in his fifties just stepping from one of the rooms into the hallway stops short at the sight of her. His white coat is awry. He strikes Celia as flustered in the coat, as though he\u2019s just assumed \u2014 or re-assumed \u2014 the trappings of a doctor.\n\u201cAre you a sleeper?\u201d he asks.\nTheir lingo for patients perhaps.\nOf course it\u2019s the opposite, Celia thinks. She wants to be snarky. You come to a sleep lab because you can\u2019t, now don\u2019t you, because your daytime being has become a tawdry fog, wisps of consciousness tendrilling out to perform only the most necessary tasks before retreating again.\n\u201cMy GP said he\u2019d booked me in for a night.\u201d\nAfter weeks of argument.\n\u201cUm,\u201d the man says. He glances back at the room he\u2019s just exited. Celia\u2019s awake suddenly to the yawning silence in the sleep lab, the rows of other doors, all shut.\nSurely she\u2019s not the only patient.\nIn the open room behind the man, a woman crosses the doorway surreptitiously, in what Celia is certain is a white bathrobe or floor-length gown, luminous \u2014 but when the woman passes back a moment later it\u2019s become a short white lab coat over stocky legs.\nOtherwise, grand silence.\n\u201cI\u2019ll \u2014 uh \u2014 we\u2019ll need your details. Your problem.\u201d The doctor glances again at the room containing the vanished woman, then leads Celia to a different room, a kind of cubbyhole office, where he paws through papers looking for forms.\nIf this guy\u2019s in charge, she\u2019s screwed. They sit on the cramped chairs while he writes.\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk about your symptoms. Microsleep?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t even get that much. Nanosleep maybe.\u201d\n\u201cI mean, do you often find yourself asleep at the wheel?\u201d The doctor reminds her of Jared, she realizes, who has always reminded her of her father. \u201cAt work?\u201d\n\u201cI find myself awake, at everything.\u201d\nIt flusters him more. How can she explain it?\nOnce upon a time there was a dreamy child and that was a problem, though only for others. Not a problem for the child, who grew to be a dreamy twenty-something, happy enough if not ever after. Aware gradually that it was a curse to want to dream her life away.\nJared had broken through, woken her with a kiss, long ago now, but at some point the blessing of being awake forevermore wore off. The noise-making of attending to her life, the attention to and from all sides, the possessions, the people who talk to her, with her, for her, walk through her: Kept awake she is a being built by others. Even if sleep were nothing else, it would mean she could be in her head, follow sweetmeat dreams down a road, to a mirror, watch the being in the glass transform back into herself.\nHer skin tightens with the longing.\nYet she doesn\u2019t know how to voice that to this man.\n\u201cI keep forgetting my name. Is that a symptom?\u201d\nHe lowers the pen from the form, softening, ruminative. There\u2019s a spark of power in his eyes Celia doesn\u2019t like. \u201cI\u2019m sure I can help you.\u201d\n\u201cYes, he\u2019s the king of sleep.\u201d The woman in the lab coat with the stocky legs has swept in, as far as the cubbyhole allows.\nUp close the woman oozes the fierce loveliness of a fairy queen, pale beneath black upswept hair, dueling impressions of dark and light. A drawing in vine charcoal. Up close the stocky legs are hairy.\nThe woman places a hand on the man\u2019s shoulder and he\u2019s abruptly wooden again. Hello, tension.\n\u201cDoctor,\u201d she says.\n\u201cDoctor,\u201d he says.\nTwo doctors then. For how many patients? Just one? Too many doctors spoil the broth, or the plasma, or something. Celia flashes on an image \u2014 these two in the other room, disrobed, as spiteful in their merged skin as her parents, the sexual power struggle she only understood much later in life, and she wants to scream I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re fucking, I just need help.\nHelp me sleep.\n\u201cCome with me,\u201d the woman tells Celia. The voice is spellbinding, motherly and vicious at the same time. It\u2019s a voice to follow, to scamper behind down the corridors to oblivion.\nThe king of sleep seems to shake off his woodenness. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, doctor,\u201d he explains. \u201cThis one\u2019s mine.\u201d\nLike a snake darting away in foliage, the woman\u2019s hand slithers from his shoulder. Celia can smell the viciousness now, bad honey in the air. There are sides to be taken here, decisions to be made.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll come with me,\u201d the woman tells her.\n\u201cWill there be needles?\u201d Celia stands, still unsure.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do this.\u201d The man has stood with her. \u201cShe\u2019s mine. It\u2019s all mine, doctor. My methods.\u201d\nJared and her father stand there, their demands of wakefulness. When her parents divorced, Celia learned this about men: that they could pout and that their pouts looked like anger.\nThere\u2019s a ligament taut across Celia\u2019s ribs, tugging her in both directions. She wants the sleep, to be again, before she becomes a nobody. She can steel herself to needles, tests, the pricking of her thumbs, yet the fairy queen\u2019s hate terrifies her and it\u2019s in that moment, as she hesitates, the nanosleep of indecision, that she\u2019s made her decision.\nThe fairy queen sees it. She touches Celia\u2019s face and Celia is air, a nothingness floating inches from the floor. Her shoes are gone.\n\u201cYou see?\u201d says the fairy queen to the king. \u201cNothing\u2019s yours.\u201d\nCelia floats down the hall behind the queen, and the king of sleep chases them until he fades into the white walls, his coat going first, only the buttons and a bemused face left for seconds, like a child\u2019s smear, before it too is cleaned away.\nIn the room with the bed the queen undresses her.\n\u201cKing of all he surveys. Except he overlooks women.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a camera high on the wall, pointed at the bed, its face marred with splotches like a foxed mirror. Will she be watched through the night? The epitome of attention. If Celia had any hope left of finding sleep, she sees it receding down that lightless eye.\n\u201cHe thinks he\u2019s good at this.\u201d\nThe queen pastes wires to Celia\u2019s head, her breasts, her thighs, weaving a sticky web about her through which she can no longer breathe, then positions her supine over the bed, suspended inches above it, the opposite of repose. Everything its opposite. The air on Celia\u2019s back is cold.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t recognize us. I\u2019ll teach him.\u201d\nIf she can make clear the terror of her symptoms, of not being. Perhaps there will be pity.\n\u201cWhat does it mean,\u201d Celia asks, \u201cwhen I look in the mirror and see no one?\u201d\nThere is no answer.\nBefore leaving the room the queen bends to whisper in her ear. \u201cHe should have recognized me. He won\u2019t cure you, I\u2019ll see to that.\u201d\nThe wires hum as if alive on her skin, sentient briars. She lies, awake still, watching the dark mirror of the camera, waiting a hundred years for someone to come and put her to sleep.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

Her face was round like an apple: a red delicious, a pink lady. The supermodel was really super.\nWhen she made her talk show appearance, the audience hooted and whistled and clapped. She had dimples and a slight cleft in her chin. She had mint-leaf green eyes and curly, caramel blonde hair that cascaded over her shoulders. The host stood grinning, holding his unbuttoned jacket together as she approached. He had a habit of hiding his belly.\nHe was portly, but his heft wasn\u2019t obvious because of the way his suit jacket made his torso appear nearly perfectly square.\nThe supermodel was dressed in the attire of ancient Rome, a fashion popularized by the collective fantasy of the gladiator\u2019s lover: sultry women awaiting their warriors\u2019 return from bloody battle. As if to signify her status in the Roman Empire, the supermodel wore a large, bronze necklace, linking together a series of identically shaped metallic fig leaves.\nOn her upper right arm, she wore a bronze Cleopatra bracelet, the gleaming head of a snake sucking on its tail. Her dress was creamy silk, sleeveless, with a wide-neck yoke. The hem rested about four inches above her knees, and the dress was darted at the waist and breasts, a sexy toga.\nShe wore high heels designed as leather Roman sandals, open toed and with thick straps wrapped around her ankles, a hint of bondage. If she wasn\u2019t so slight of build, one might get the impression she was fierce, ready for an arena battle alongside her beloved.\nThe talk show host bent forward and kissed her gleaming cheek, a fatherly gesture executed with a twinkle in his hyena eye, like he might like to eat her. He pointed to a chair, and she looked back at the audience again, waving once more before seating herself amidst wild applause. The host sat behind a big desk, like an executive, opening his jacket while keeping his belly strategically below the desktop.\n\u201cWell, whoa,\u201d said the host, greeting the supermodel. \u201cSuper to see you, apparently. They\u2019re jazzed up,\u201d referring to the audience.\n\u201cYes, same here,\u201d she said, running her hands across her hem, straightening her Roman attire.\nThe host had an extraordinarily large football-shaped head, no neck, the point of his chin meeting his clavicles. His hair, which had once been black and slick, was now poofy and white and came to a point on top like a Kewpie doll.\nOn either side of his oblong head he had flappy, fat ears. As king of late night TV, he was oblivious to his homeliness, a condition that, due to his status, went largely ignored by one and all.\nThe supermodel sat opposite him, but with her body facing forward, toward the audience, crossing her legs and clasping her hands in her lap. In order to look at him without repositioning herself, it appeared she had to crane her neck and turn her head to the left, unnaturally. It looked more awkward than it was, a bit of a camera trick.\nBeyond them, the set included a fake window out of which appeared a fake city skyline, as if the interview were taking place in a network producers\u2019 skyscraper office that brushed against a hem of clouds.\nIt was in this setting that she, the supermodel, sat waiting for the first question, which she could predict would have something to do with lingerie. She was the face, and body, of a world-famous lingerie company.\nThe company had recently earned a bad name because their \u201cBijou Bra\u201d had caused a series of severe skin rashes due to the toxic components contained within the bras\u2019 padding, a problem the company had yet to confirm or deny even though women all across the globe had photographed their afflicted, blistering breasts and posted them on the internet.\nThere was a class action suit pending.\nIn a rush for positive PR, the makers of the Bijou Bra had sent their most famous model on the talk-show circuit. Although recent appearances included wearing clothes, she was more familiar to the public as a scantily clad runway waif who modeled only modest amounts of material over her most private parts, exposing exquisitely unblemished skin of such beauty one might be led to believe she\u2019d only recently liberated herself from the kingdom of hypoallergenic cotton balls where she\u2019d been born and raised.\n\u201cHeard you were in France,\u201d said the host. \u201cAn incident with the angel wings?\u201d\n\u201cEmm,\u201d she said. \u201cI took a tumble,\u201d she smiled then frowned to the audience.\nThe host looked off set and asked an unseen person if he could roll the clip. A flat screen rose up from the cityscape behind them. The supermodel rolled her eyes. \u201cOh, no, you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said. The audience tittered.\nThe supermodel appeared on screen wearing sequined red bikini underpants, trimmed in white with a bow centered four inches beneath her perfectly puckered belly button. Up top, she wore a matching brassiere and a giant pair of red wings.\nShe smiled widely and walked confidently, sexily, into the camera\u2019s lens. The wings were embedded with tiny white LED lights, which blinked in time with pulsating techno music. The wingspan was six feet across, and the wingtips rose two feet over her head. She appeared as a super-sized sparkly bug.\nThe runway, which was lit from underneath, was covered with chunks of what looked like see-through stones. It was the lingerie company\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day show. Plump dwarves holding miniature bows and arrows padded up and down the sides of the catwalk, careful to stay out of the models\u2019 path. On the clip, the supermodel was still smiling, still looking directly at the camera, when she took a wrong step and her left knee turned at an unnatural angle, and she collapsed sideways.\n\u201cOuch,\u201d said the host.\n\u201cI know,\u201d said the supermodel. \u201cThat was glass. They had covered the runway in crushed glass.\u201d\n\u201cDouble ouch,\u201d said the host, wiggling his eyebrows and looking out to the audience, which tittered on cue.\n\u201cThose wings weighed over 30 pounds,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you start to fall, you can\u2019t right yourself. You go down.\u201d\nThe host didn\u2019t acknowledge the angel wing difficulties. Instead a new image appeared on a screen. The supermodel appeared in a tiger-striped bra and matching panties, half straddling and half lying across the back of a live elephant. The photo was taken from the right side of the elephant.\nThe elephant\u2019s luminous right eye, as big as a softball, was turned toward the camera, warily. The supermodel appeared to be stroking the elephant\u2019s neck wearing an expression of sexual ecstasy.\n\u201cLucky elephant,\u201d said the host, smirking and flipping his pencil in the air.\n\u201cIt was hairy,\u201d she said. \u201cPrickly,\u201d she added, trying to make him understand. \u201cIt smelled.\u201d\nThe host asked her if, on a dangerous shoot, she ever carried a good luck charm. He\u2019d been informed by his producers that she did.\nThe supermodel reached into the cityscape behind her where it appeared she had hid some of her belongings in the neon lit city streets. She pulled out a small sack about the size and shape of a man\u2019s scrotum.\n\u201cYou want to see my secret?\u201d\n\u201cWell, that depends,\u201d said the host. \u201cWhat would my wife think?\u201d Off camera was a quick drum roll and single smack of a bass drum followed by the smash of a riding cymbal.\nShe spilled the contents across his desk.\n\u201cMy God,\u201d he said, drawing back in mock revulsion. \u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d\n\u201cTeeth,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery tooth that was ever pulled from my mouth, plus the ones that fell out naturally.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what are these crumbles? Can we get a tight of this?\u201d The camera closed in to show a stained molar, roots attached, and what appeared to be specks of dirt mixed in with the yellowed baby teeth.\n\u201cDecomposition,\u201d she offered. \u201cPerhaps old fillings?\u201d\n\u201cCan you do me a favor?\u201d he asked. \u201cCan you get this off my desk?\u201d\nShe turned and winked at the audience, who laughed. And then she scooped up her teeth.\n\u201cEeesh,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat about exotic locales? Do you get to go to secret hidden places for shoots?\u201d\n\u201cI got stuck in the desert in a broken down Land Rover last month, me and five crew. We\u2019d been driving six hours. I had to go the bathroom so badly. There weren\u2019t any trees.\u201d\nThe host groaned. \u201cTrees. What\u2019s with the trees?\u201d\n\u201cPrivacy,\u201d she said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any.\u201d\n\u201cWell, how about another place?\u201d The host was trying change the subject. \u201cSomewhere less arid, did you ever find yourself\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI had to go,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, I just squatted down and took a shit.\u201d She laughed. She knew they\u2019d have to bleep that. The host looked horrified. She wasn\u2019t supposed to talk about that. They hadn\u2019t rehearsed that. He wasn\u2019t sure where she was going with this. People wanted to hear about exotic locales with a beautiful woman. They weren\u2019t tuning in to hear about defecating in the desert.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be back, after a break, with our musical guest,\u201d the host said, hurried.\n\u201cI really had to go,\u201d she said, \u201cso I went.\u201d\nOffstage, a producer drew a forefinger across his neck, signaling to the film crew who were already counting backward, \u201cfive, four, three\u2026\u201d\nThe supermodel held tight to her lucky sack of teeth, her beautiful bag of bones.","source-hostname":"The Fabulist Words & Art"}

It hadn\u2019t taken long, her dad liberal with his guilt money. He paid her well to handle his responsibilities \u2014 Jamie\u2019s twin half-brothers \u2014 while he wined and dined his new wife.\nThey left for the city at seven in the morning, Sean driving his mother\u2019s black SUV slowly in the rain, the windshield a tablet of liquid gray the wipers pushed about uselessly.\nHis mother, like Jamie\u2019s, thought they were taking their SATs.\n\u201cI feel a little guilty, lying. She left me a good luck note with the keys,\u201d Sean said.\nAn image of Jamie\u2019s mother flashed into her mind. \u201cNo tattoos!\u201d she\u2019d said. \u201cThey\u2019re permanent, Jamie.\u201d Something else her mother didn\u2019t know. Nothing was permanent these days.\nGetting the teal-colored dragon inked on her upper arm didn\u2019t hurt the way Jamie had anticipated. What she didn\u2019t expect was the ache in her bicep, long after the scabbing was gone.\nBut each day at school Sean inspected the tattoo and pronounced it fine.\nOver time the ache lessened but the tattoo kept Jamie awake at night. Or rather, it woke her.\nDreams.\nThe dragon left his roost on her arm and towered above her, stared her down with glittering, garnet eyes displaying an emotion she couldn\u2019t identify. Something the creature had drained like osmosis from her body. She always woke before she discovered the dragon\u2019s intentions.\nJamie first saw the fire one night when, fresh from the shower, she was toweling dry. A scarlet-colored cloud roiling from the dragon\u2019s nostrils. She ran her fingers over it.\nIt couldn\u2019t be infection \u2014 the fire was as well defined as if it had been inked there. She pulled on her nightgown and called Sean. They agreed to meet by the tennis courts before school in the morning.\nIn Jamie\u2019s dream that night the dragon was immense, spewing a dense blue smoke that paralyzed her. The swirling smoke pulled apart in patches to reveal the twins\u2019 cribs. Jamie woke sweating, her nightgown plastered to her chest.\nHeart pounding, she carefully pushed up her sleeve. The flames were now a deep magenta.\nIn the morning Sean walked her to the nurse\u2019s office. The school nurse called Jamie\u2019s mother herself, reporting that though Jamie didn\u2019t have a fever, she\u2019d come down with something; her face was pasty white.\nAt home, Jamie slept all afternoon \u2014 no dreams.\nThat night she was wide awake; she sat in her desk chair looking out the window upon the silvery lawn, the maple tree a solemn sentinel. The stillness held something.\nBy daylight the dragon breathed purple. Jamie went to her mother, shook her shoulder, and announced that she was still sick. Her mother\u2019s sleep-puffed face tugged at Jamie. She wanted to climb in beside her, nest into her mother\u2019s side. Her mother sat up and pressed the alarm button off with a short capable finger.\n\u201cGo back to bed,\u201d she said, swinging her feet to the floor. \u201cI\u2019ll see if I can get you into the doctor\u2019s today.\u201d\nJamie dragged her leaden body back to her room, tunneled under the covers she knew offered no protection. Soon her mother appeared bearing tea and toast on a tray. Food was her mother\u2019s answer to everything. \u201cI got you an appointment for ten.\u201d\nDoctor Snedden found nothing wrong. Did Jamie have something on her mind? A lot of teens went to counselors. She wrote down a name and handed Jamie the slip of paper.\nHer mother dropped Jamie at home, saying she needed to go into the office for the afternoon. Jamie should get caught up on her homework, prepare to return to school tomorrow. \u201cWarm up some soup for lunch,\u201d she said.\n\u201cJamie?\u201d Her mother, from the foyer.\n\u201cOut here.\u201d Jamie slid her sleeve down over the dragon whose fire was now blue, orange, chartreuse. The dragon\u2019s belly had transformed: carnation pink, parrot yellow.\n\u201cI stopped on the way home.\u201d Her mother placed a pizza box on the counter and opened it to show Jamie. \u201cVegetarian. Black olives, too.\u201d\nHer mother\u2019s dimpling face, its eager expression filled Jamie with a vicious rage. \u201cCan\u2019t you think of anything but food?\u201d Her arm jumped, swiped the pizza to the floor. Sauce splattered across the tile.\nFor a moment they stood together silently. Then her mother sighed and took up the roll of paper towels.\nBecause she didn\u2019t know what to do, because she hated her mother on her knees, hated herself for putting her mother there, Jamie spun and punched the arm through the window.\nIt didn\u2019t hurt.\nBlood streamed from her cut hand down to her elbow, leaking off onto the floor.\nHer mother\u2019s face was white as she wrapped a dish towel around Jamie\u2019s hand, squeezing pressure to the cuts. With her other hand, she moved a wad of paper towels up Jamie\u2019s arm, mopping blood. Then she saw the dragon appear from under the sleeve.\nJamie watched her mother\u2019s face. Then she, too, looked. The fire was gone. The tiny teal-colored dragon sat placidly, almost comically.\nHer mother licked a finger, rubbed the ink. \u201cIt\u2019s permanent?\u201d\nPeg Alford Pursell is a National Endowment for the Humanities Independent Study Fellow and the founder of the Creative Writing Program at the Charleston School of the Arts.
