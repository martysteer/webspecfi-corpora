As I reviewed a particularly lack-luster chart,\nI couldn\u2019t help but be distracted by a little hole in the\nwall above my printer. The hole was quite small, but it certainly\nwas disturbing because it wasn\u2019t there yesterday.\nAt first, I didn\u2019t think much of it. Little\nhole. Kids hadn\u2019t been in the room, and if they had, they\u2019d\nhave left a much bigger hole. Kids are like that. They don\u2019t\ndo any damage small. I decided that the hole was the result of a\nnail hanging a picture from days gone by, and I just had never noticed\nit before. I went on to prepare my stock orders for another hour,\nthen I went up to bed.\nOn Monday morning, as I often do, I went into\nmy home office after the wife left for work. I turned on the computer\nto quickly check my usual online haunts, and while it was booting,\nI noticed the hole had grown overnight. Where Sunday evening the\nhole looked to have been left by a brad, it now looked like a six-inch\nnail had been there. Quite curious.\nI wanted a closer look at that hole, but my printer\nis on the hutch of the computer table that I use to store stuff\nI don\u2019t know what else to do with. I\u2019m not very tall,\nso I had to stand on a chair to get high enough to get a good look\nat the hole. Once I moved the pile of unread junk mail that was\nin the way, I moved the chair into position and climbed on up.\nWhen I leaned in toward that little hole, I could see there was\nsomething strange about it. It almost seemed alive. I could see\nmotion.\nI jumped down from the chair and dug through the\ncloset until I had a mess all over the floor, but I did manage to\nfind what I was looking for. I have this four-inch magnifying lens\nsalvaged from the trash bin of a company I worked for way-back-when.\nIt was part of a lamp used on a laboratory bench, but I lost the\nbracket. It\u2019s now just a gangly big magnifying lens with a\nlong arm that isn\u2019t completely stable \u2013 useful for cooking\ninsects and for looking at little but growing holes in the wall.\nI climbed back onto the chair and held up the magnifying lens. That\nnot-completely-stable arm swung around, propelling the lens into\nmy forehead. After a few choice words, I grabbed the stupid thing\nby the neck and held the lens up again. This time, I could see the\nhole very clearly. What I saw through that lens looked quite a bit\nlike the accretion disk of a black hole.\n\u201cNow that\u2019s odd,\u201d I said, because\nit was.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s odd, Daddy?\u201d\nIt was the boy.\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be getting ready for\nthe school bus?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cI am ready,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOh, okay.\u201d That was all I could think\nto say.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s odd, Daddy?\u201d he repeated.\n\u201cWe have a black hole in the wall.\u201d\n\u201cWe have a lot of black holes in the wall.\nEverywhere you try to hang a picture takes three or four tries.\u201d\nThe little rat was observant, I\u2019ll give him that. \u201cThere\u2019s\ngray smudges on the wall, too,\u201d he continued. \u201cWay up\nby the ceiling, from when you used the ladder Mommy doesn\u2019t\nwant you to use in the house anymore.\u201d\n\u201cNever mind about the ladder,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI\u2019m really worried about this hole.\u201d\n\u201cI think you should be worried about\u2014\u201d\nThe arm of the magnifying lens swung around and cracked me in the\nback of the head. \u201c\u2014the arm of that lens hitting you\nin the head.\u201d\nI thanked him for his warning, then took another\nlook at the hole. Out of curiosity, I grabbed a bent paper clip\nand pressed it into the hole. It went in and out without any problem.\nThat was unexpected. If this truly were a black hole in the wall,\nit should have consumed the paperclip.\nThe boy was still in the room. \u201cHand me\nthat safety pin on the desk, please.\u201d\nHe gave the pin to me, and I opened it wider than\nit was supposed to go in order to give me more room to work. I stuck\nthe pin into the wall at an angle and pushed the point toward the\nhole.\n\u201cDaddy?\"\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you putting another hole in the\nwall?\u201d\nI ignored him as I watched the edge of the hole,\nwaiting to see the point of the pin. It never emerged. When I removed\nthe pin from the wall, the tip of it was gone.\nI couldn\u2019t rehook the safety pin because\nthe pin part was now too short, so I just set it by the printer.\n\u201cThis is a problem,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a problem?\u201d It was my\nyounger daughter.\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be getting ready for\nthe school bus?\u201d I asked while I was wondering when she showed\nup.\n\u201cI am ready,\u201d she said.\n\u201cOh, okay.\u201d I looked at the clock.\nIt was time to go outside to wait for the school bus. \u201cWhy\ndon\u2019t you kids get your backpacks and head out to the garage?\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d they both said in tandem.\n\u201cBut,\u201d just my daughter now, \u201cwhat is the problem?\u201d\n\u201cThis hole in the wall,\u201d I said.\nShe giggled. \u201cDaddy, we have a lot of holes\nin the wall.\u201d\nEveryone is a smart-aleck. \u201cMost of them\naren\u2019t two-dimensional black-holes.\u201d\nFor a moment, she had a perplexed look on her\nface, then she smiled and said, \u201cCan you come outside to wait\nfor the bus with us?\u201d\nI looked at the hole, then down at her, then back\nat the hole. \u201cOkay. I suppose the hole can wait ten minutes.\u201d\n\u201cAre you staying home from work because\nof the hole, Daddy?\u201d\n\u201cProbably.\u201d I climbed off the chair\nand followed her out the office door into the foyer and on toward\nthe bathroom, where I noticed the light was still on. \u201cIs\nsomebody in there?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cI am,\u201d my other daughter said.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cBrushing my hair.\u201d\n\u201cStill?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m almost done.\u201d She was almost\ndone forty-five minutes ago, too.\n\u201cWell, the bus is coming soon and I am not\ndriving you to school if you miss it.\u201d I walked a couple steps\nmore, then paused. \u201cIt\u2019s Monday, don\u2019t forget\nyour violin.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d The light went off\nas I walked through the laundry room to the garage and out to the\nstreet where the two younger kids were already kicking stones and\nrunning amok through the neighbor\u2019s yard. That\u2019s how\nthey wait for the bus.\nMy other daughter finally emerged from the house\nas the bus pulled up. Before getting on, my younger daughter asked,\n\u201cWhy is that particular hole a problem?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s growing,\u201d I said,\n\u201cI need to stay home from work today so I can fix it.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, then bounded away,\ndisappearing into the bus. I waved at the driver, then went back\ninside to deal with the hole. That would be much easier with the\nkids gone. I walked back into the office and sat down in my computer\nchair, looking up at the two-dimensional black hole stuck in my\nwall. Fix it? How?\nSpackle! I rushed out to the garage and picked\nup the container of spackle from the workbench. After a few minutes\nof digging for my putty knife, I went back into the office to spackle\nthat hole, only to discover that the spackle was a little dry. Well,\nit was worth a shot.\nI scooped a bit of crumbly spackle onto my putty knife and mashed\nit into the hole. After smoothing it down, I went into the kitchen\nto grab another cup of coffee. When I got back to the office, the\nhole had grown, and the spackle chunk was lying on top of my printer.\nAfter fishing the spackle out of the paper feed\ntray, where it dropped as I tried to pick it up, I sat down to think\nabout what to do next. After a few minutes, I spun my chair around\nand reached for my astronomy book. I needed to brush up on black\nholes to know what I was up against. A two-dimensional black hole\nhad no right to exist. Well, I suppose it had as much right to exist\nas I did, but it still violated every law of physics I ever learned\nin college. Not that I didn\u2019t invent some physics on exams,\nbut in this case, I was pretty sure that the thing shouldn\u2019t\nreally exist. I just didn\u2019t know how to convince the black\nhole.\nI yawned, then set the physics book on the floor\non top of the January issue of Barron\u2019s and a stray sock,\nthen looked back at the hole in the wall. It was now about the size\nof a quarter. I glanced at the clock and decided that I had to at\nleast get that hole out of my wall before it consumed the whole\nthing.\nThe problem with being a pack rat is that there\nisn\u2019t anywhere to put things, so I moved my printer to the\ntop of my fax machine to prevent drywall dust from falling into\nit. (I\u2019m not sure which device I was trying to protect.) After\na fifteen minute hunt for my box knife, and another five to change\nto a sharp blade, I stood up on that chair and cut a square six\ninches to a side, with the black hole in the center \u2013 well,\na little off-center, but close.\nI had a scare as the piece almost fell inside\nthe wall, but I caught it with the blade of the box knife and managed\nto work it out of the wall. After retracting the blade, I stuck\nthe box knife into my pocket (don\u2019t laugh, I\u2019ve done\nit without retracting the blade), then climbed off the chair and\ncarried my specimen to the kitchen. I set it flat on the table while\nI phoned work.\nAs I was explaining to my boss how terribly sick\nI had become, it occurred to me that the thing should be extremely\nheavy. You know, condensed matter and all that. Since it wasn\u2019t\nany heavier than a normal piece of drywall that size, I assumed\nthat being confined to two dimensions must have some strange way\nof keeping the mass low, at least from the point of view of a three-dimensional\nengineer playing hooky and home-owner that was going to have to\nexplain a six-inch square hole in the wall to his wife. Better than\ntrying to explain a two-dimensional black hole that I still didn\u2019t\nknow what to do with. I hung up the phone and sat at the kitchen\ntable watching the thing slowly consume the drywall.\nOne thing was certain, I had to do something with\nit. If I kept it in the house, it might eventually grow to cut my\nhouse in half. If I leaned it against a tree, it might eventually\ncut the planet in half. Now, that would be an interesting experiment,\nbut I doubted that I had enough insurance to pay for the damage.\nPlus, all the innards of the planet would probably ooze out and\nwe\u2019d never get it all back inside again. Maybe that\u2019s\nwhat happened to Iapetus. Anyway, that was an experiment I wanted\nno part of, so the question remained, what to do with this two-dimensional\nblack hole that was now the size of a half-dollar.\nI had to think, and I didn\u2019t know how long\nthat might take, so I took the drywall chunk outside and set it\non the picnic table, hoping the dog would leave it alone. I walked\nback to the door, then I turned back and called the dog. When he\ncame running to me, I locked him inside the pool fence so he couldn\u2019t\nget at the black hole. The way dogs hold things in their mouths,\nthe black hole might cut right through his head. That would be messy.\nAfter I secured the gate, I ignored his barking\nand went back inside to fire up the computer. I trawled around the\ninternet until I found a discussion group on black holes. I posted\na simple question. How do you stop a black hole from growing? The\nanswer came back in a few minutes: stop feeding it.\nBrilliant! Stop feeding it. It was stuck inside\na piece of sheetrock. The thing would eat until it got to the edge,\nthen it would eat the air. And then the flower pot on the picnic\ntable, and then the lemon tree, and it would never stop until it\nran out of stuff after it grew big enough.\nHow do you stop a rhinoceros from charging? Take\naway its credit card. How do you stop a black hole from eating?\nTake away the food.\nI ran to the garage, jumped into my pickup, then\ndrove to the hardware store. It was an interesting problem, but\nI thought I had it figured out. At the hardware store, I bought\nsome heavy-gauge sheet metal, a welding torch and supplies, an air\nvalve, some rubber tubing, some wire, eight eye-screws, and four\nc-clamps.\nI got it all back home and welded the metal into a box, leaving\none side open. The black hole was almost to the edge of the sheetrock,\nand I had no idea how fast it might grow when it got out, so I tightened\nthe clamps onto the four corners of the sheetrock and attached wires\nfrom the clamps to eye-screws welded into the corners of the box.\nWhen it was done, the sheetrock was firmly suspended in the middle\nof the box. I cut a small hole in the piece of metal that would\nbecome the sixth face of the cube, and in that hole I welded the\nvalve. After welding the last face onto the box, I carried the whole\nthing to the garage, along with the tubing.\nI popped the hood of my truck and connected one\nend of the tubing to the vacuum line of my engine and the other\nend to the nozzle on the valve. I let my truck pull a vacuum until\nthe tubing collapsed, then I closed the valve and removed the tubing.\nAfter turning off the truck, I carried the box into my office.\nThe stuff from inside the closet was still scattered across the\nfloor, and the stuff that managed to stay inside the closet was\nin too much disarray to leave room for my box containing the black\nhole. For a moment, I considered just tossing it onto the trash,\nbut the box would probably be damaged enough to allow an air leak,\nallowing the black hole to eat a plane across the landfill, then\nsever the mountain and cut apart the Indian casino, and on into\ndowntown Phoenix. Dumping it in the trash was out.\nIf I gave the thing away, somebody would make\nmoney from it and I wouldn\u2019t see a cent. eBay! I could sell\nit on eBay! Then I thought about it. Why really include a black\nhole if you can just sell empty metal? I made a mental note to follow\nup on that idea.\nBury it? Nah, way too much work digging because\nof the caliche.\nSo, I did what I do with everything else I can\u2019t\nfigure out what to do with \u2013 I stuck it on the other computer\ndesk on top of my stack of Barron\u2019s magazines.\nI had just finished setting down the metal box\nwhen I heard the squeaky brakes of the school bus. A moment later,\nthree kids came crashing through the front door. My youngest daughter\ncame into the office. She pointed at the square hole in the wall\nand said with a smile, \u201cIt's still growing!\u201d\n|\n|\n______\n|\n||\n|\n______","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}

Darkness still fluttered over his\nmobile home and all of Metatron City. Every morning he awoke before\ndawn because, once the sun rose, he would join his neighbors in\nthe daily struggle to escape Metatron, mankind\u2019s final destination.\nUnlike his fellow comrades, Peterson understood\nthat no escape was possible. Clawing at barbed gates and charging\nmasked guards with butterfly knife arms for eight hours a day\nleft them with what they\u2019d always had: nothing. Yet their\nwork didn\u2019t necessarily go unnoticed. The Headstones, or\nruling class, nominated three ants, as working class members were\nknown, each month to join their rank. Curiously, nobody ever recalled\nhaving known any of the \u201cimmaculate ants,\u201d or even\nanyone else who had known one. Three per month for the last thirty-six\nmonths, and all total strangers.\nThen again, with a reported population of 144,000,000\nand no means of long distance communication, ants bonded only\nwith the other ants in their park, forty units holding one ant\napiece. Of course, The Headstones ignored this estrangement of\nthe lower class, but then again, so did the lower class itself.\nA community is forty, the banner waving in front of each park\nread.\nPeterson awoke early, though. Not because he hated sleep, but\ndue to a number that troubled him. Thirty-six. They\u2019d been\nfighting to escape from Metatron City for thirty-six months, but\nwhat came before that? According to birth records, all 144,000,000\ncivilians arrived in the same month, on the same day. Yet Peterson\nhad no recollection of infancy, almost as if something had imprisoned\nthem and... and what? Erased their memories and installed a hierarchy\nof futility? No, everyone in Metatron appeared the same--sandy\nbrown hair cropped short, green eyes, near the age of thirty,\nand a one-piece suit--blue for men, red for women.\nDid he alone wake early every morning to dwell\non these facts? Maybe they weren\u2019t facts. Could it be the\nself-induced sleep deprivation? Peterson poured a cup of sour\ncoffee and lit a whiskey-flavored cigarette, both supplied by\nthe city.\nNobody received paychecks in Metatron, or at\nleast not any ants. The Headstones might, but discussion of them\nwith neighbors was banned under the first amendment. Peterson\nclosed his eyes and pushed the smoke out his nose. He wondered\nsome more.\nSomething inside told him that what he understood,\nor thought he did, shouldn\u2019t be known. A conspiracy against...nothing?\nThen he visualized the phrase shouted by all the butterfly knife-men.\nTotal fucking waste. Total fucking waste. Total fucking waste.\nChanting it for eight hours a day, no breaks. Obviously the guards\nmeant the attempted flight from Metatron was futile, but why?\nCould there be nowhere to go? No land to which they could flee\nand find refuge?\nPeterson crushed his second cigarette against\nthe white linoleum floor and positioned his sockless, blistered\nfeet into his steel-toed boots. He left his mobile home to gather\nwith his comrades, like every other day, at the gates.\nToday the butterfly knife-men attacked first.\nWhen Peterson marched up they were already slicing through the\nfront line of ants. Almost grinning beneath their black masks,\nthought Peterson. He wiped rain from his forehead and stared into\nthe hardly visible morning sun. Since when had it been black?\nEven when the ants seizure-collapsed, bled their\nred blood, and vomited until only fleshy, raisin-like sacks remained\nof their bodies, they never failed to rise again. Not zombies,\nthough, because they never died. And perhaps no life existed from\nwhich they could be resurrected.\nPeterson stormed to the front. He tucked his\nuntrimmed fingers into his palms and rested his thumbs across\nthe knuckles, forming proper fists. Raising both in front of him\nand tucking his chin to his right shoulder, Peterson cried out\nand charged.\nBy some rule of the game unknown to him, the\nmasked guards with butterfly knives for arms froze, some of their\nblades locked halfway through the necks of ants who, however many\ntimes they were beheaded, would never die.\nThen the guards fluttered into the sky, perhaps\nto slash at the black sun that would rise forever, if only to\nspite them.\nIt hadn\u2019t even reached noontime, but all\nthe figures in the sky cast a jagged shadow over the army of ants.\nPeterson stumbled to the front. An ant puked something that looked\nlike molded chicken liver on his left boot. No matter, the war\nwas over. Nobody remained to guard the gates, all of it over a\nphrase released from the lips of... who was he?\nTotal fucking waste.\nWhy had he uttered it? Ants stared up at him\nfrom every side, except forward, where the gate stood seventy\nfeet high.\nPeterson found the single door, with its barbed\nwire handle, and squeezed. As if he had greased the handle with\nhis blood, he turned the handle.\nBright light dripped in, slowly. Before the\nsurge of light or ants could swing the door one way or another,\nPeterson slammed it shut. He ripped his hand free of the barbs\nand turned to face the hushed crowd.\nFuck my brothers, and fuck The Headstones.\n\u201cWe need this war,\u201d he said, facing\nthe species he could no longer identify as his own.\nHe crouched and prepared to defend the gates.\n\u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d the first Headstone,\ndressed in the white tuxedo that came with privilege, asked him.\nPeterson rose his head and sniffled to keep the blood from dripping\nover his mouth. \u201cI already told you.\u201d\nA second Headstone popped him with a jab across\nthe chin. \u201cThis was our chance to say goodbye to this shithole.\nYour chance too, you know?\u201d\n\u201cThen why weren\u2019t you,\u201d Peterson\ncoughed, \u201cout there fighting?\u201d\n\u201cThe gates are gone,\u201d said Headstone\n#1.\n\u201cAll gone, and now you\u2019re about\nto be gone too.\u201d said #2.\nHeadstone #1 flicked out a butterfly knife.\n\u201cSo tell us where you put \u2018em or we\u2019ll cut your\nnuts off.\u201d\nThe blood reached Peterson\u2019s mouth, muffling\nhis words. \u201cPut what?\u201d\nHeadstone #2 leaned in. \u201cWhat\u2019s\nthat he\u2019s saying?\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said\n#1, \u201cjust tell us where you put the gates! See, it\u2019s\nlike this. You stole our gates so all the ants have no purpose.\nWell if they don\u2019t have no purpose, then me and my buddy\nhere lose our power. And if we lose our power,\u201d he smiled,\n\u201cyou lose your sack.\u201d\nTwo in charge. All along, two in charge.\n#2 flicked on a lamp overhead. Its swinging\ncaused a strobe-light effect in the room.\nLike being interrogated by devils about God.\n\u201cNo God,\u201d said #1.\nCould they read his mind? Had it always been\nthis way?\n\u201cGod,\u201d said #2, \u201cis dead.\u201d\nHeadstone #1 dropped the knife and eyed his\npartner.\u201cWhat\ndid I tell you about that, huh? GOD ISN\u2019T DEAD. THERE IS\nNO DEATH FOR ANY OF US. Got it?\u201d\nThe light flickered out for several seconds,\nand when it returned, Headstone #2 had vanished.\n#1 grabbed his knife and looked down at Peterson, who was tied\nto the dissecting table. \u201cFuckin\u2019 bad move, son. A\nbad move.\u201d\nPeterson hadn\u2019t felt any pain as the knife\npopped through his skin and worked into his inner flesh. He\u2019d\nalready fallen into shock. Except he hurt now.\nThirty-six months ago Peterson finished his\nlife as an ant. Surely his body lived on. He saw it every morning\u2014sleeping\nin his bed, drinking his sour coffee, smoking his whiskey-flavored\ncigarettes.\nThe pain that he felt, the pain that would never\ncease, was Time. Peterson screamed, but it hit Metatron City as\nnothing but one of 144,000,000 alarm clocks.\nInside that rounded frame of bone stir the numbers\ncarved of human flesh, and every morning Peterson imagines the\ndrear-patter against the tin roof to be droplets of his own blood,\nfluttering down in butterfly frenzy from the black sun. And when\nhe recalls The Headstones his clock-body shudders, for he knows\nno one will ever come closer to God.","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}

If you observe the night sky from light-drenched\nTimes Square, you might see a dozen or so stars, compared\nwith the thousands that were visible from the same spot when\nPeter Stuyvesant was hobbling around town.\"\n--Neil deGrasse Tyson\nThe rushing\nstream spilled over the cliff to the rock shelf below. The spot\nwas known to no one but Fara and she had never been there. Her vantage\nwas near the base of the falls; she looked up at the sky without\neyes and listened to the impact without ears. Fara had too little\neducation to guess that the rock shelf was radioactive pitchblende,\nthe stream subzero liquid methane pulled down by gravity a dozen\ntimes the terrestrial standard. She knew only that this place was\nnovel, beautiful and private.\nFara moved closer to the bottom of the falls,\nrisking the loss of that connection lately grown so tenuous. The\nsound from the methane\u2019s impact was like no musical instrument\nshe had heard or ever would. Sheer cliffs last a short time in such\nimmense gravity, this one having formed from an earthquake along\na thrust fault. Accelerated erosion in the stream bed had enlarged\nmany fine grooves along its length, scalloping its cross-section\nwhere it opened into the waterfall. Rivulets of methane thrust straight\ndown to the surface slab of pitchblende below; in geological time,\nit took only a moment for hemispherical divots to erode. Ever full\nwith liquid replenished in a constant drill rather than a cascade,\nthe erosion-polished bowls of dense stone released a low, pure chord\nthrough the gaseous atmosphere. It had the majesty of a choir of\norgans and would last only one more tick of geological time before\nerosion wore the stream flow into a single channel or wore through\nthe pitchblende to the porous stratum below. The high gravity didn\u2019t\nprevent a fine mist from wafting up a few meters above the base\nof the waterfall and Fara looked up through it to a bright sky pocked\nwith pink-edged turbans of vaporous methane. The prismatic gauze\nfrom twin sources of sunlight treated her to an amalgam of vision\nand sound unique to that planet or any other in the galaxy.\nAt first she thought it was a nuance of sound\nfrom the falls she had missed before. Then it came through, forcing\nout everything else: a motorcycle horn outside her window. Contact\nwas sundered and the alien landscape replaced by her own bedroom\nin the muggy pre-dawn. Like the character in A Tale of Two Cities,\nFara was recalled to life.\nFara turned back the sheet, got up from her pallet\nand looked down at the street below her second-story window. There\nwere no lamps and she could barely make out the cause of the commotion\u2014a\nstray dog was sprinting from a rickshaw driver who couldn\u2019t\nspare any time getting to the lucrative fares downtown. For this,\nFara had been ousted from her wondrous retreat. According to the\nalarm clock, she had to begin her day in another six minutes, but\nFara valued every second she could snatch away.\nEleven-year-old Hasina was sleeping undisturbed on her side of the\nroom. As stealthily as possible, Fara performed ablutions with the\nbowl and cloth on her bureau, brushed her hair and doffed her cotton\nnightshirt for her usual day wear. When she had finished winding\nher yellow and green sari, she saw there was exactly one minute\nleft before six. Fara flicked off the alarm button and kissed Hasina\non the forehead.\n\u201cGood morning, sister.\u201d\nOne after the other, Hasina opened her eyes. Fara\nretired to her side of the room quickly, knowing how bad Hasina\u2019s\nmorning breath was when she yawned herself awake. At the same time\nFara got done winding the clock, a mechanical clanking sounded in\nthe other bedroom\u2014Father and Mujib were awake. Fara went downstairs\nwhile the others dressed.\nFara took good advantage of her unwanted head\nstart on the morning\u2019s chores. By the time everyone finished\ntheir sunrise prayers, the kitchen stove was burning and breakfast\u2014tea,\nsweetened rice with raisins, fresh orange and mango sections\u2014was\nready to serve. Fara and Hasina set everything on the bamboo breakfast\nmat under Father\u2019s approving eye and he gently squeezed their\nproffered hands before the family sat down to eat. He couldn\u2019t\nhave squeezed harder had he wanted to. The tuberculosis that killed\nFara\u2019s mother had scarred Father\u2019s spine and permanently\nweakened his arms.\nThey sat two to each side of the mat, a one-time\nfarm family living in a Dhaka row house. Fara was surrogate mother\nto Hasina, soon to take her place as manager of the household, and\neight-year-old Mujib, the only boy in the family and Father\u2019s\nhope for the future. As in Western homes, breakfast on weekdays\nwas a purely functional meal and everyone ate quietly, Father with\nfastidious care to protect his long waxed mustache; it was all that\nremained to him for natural adornment now that his black hair was\nfalling out.\nFara left the house by the front door, preceded\nby Hasina and Mujib. Father had already moved the rickshaw out onto\nthe uncurbed street and relocked the steel accordion gate to its\nstorage port. The passenger seat enclosure was covered on back and\nsides with a pattern of aggressively colorful forms. They served\ntwo economic functions: drawing the attention of potential fares\nand bringing in revenue from a publicity-seeking artist a few doors\ndown.\n\u201cDon\u2019t expect me home till around\neight,\u201d Father told Fara. \u201cTikka said something about\na late job interview.\u201d\nHasina and Mujib put their school books into the\nrear of the rickshaw; Father would drive them to school before taking\non paying customers. As for Fara, she would ride the bus to work.\nFara disliked the four-minute walk to the bus stop, not because\nof any proneness to sore feet. The wind of Fara\u2019s sari had\nnothing suggestive about it and she avoided makeup like other women\nof the Bangladeshi working class. This didn\u2019t preserve her,\nhowever, from getting overly admiring looks from strange men she\npassed on the street. Fara was pretty, tall and had broad, heavy\nhips that swiveled too much when she walked. To male bystanders,\nFara in motion was a living cartoon of female fertility.\nLike Father\u2019s rickshaw, the bus was tricked\nout with adornments paid for by the people who put them there, but\nthe effect was less pleasing. The blame lay partly with their extreme\nmotliness, everything from Pepsi logos to pictures of Bangladeshi\nfilm stars, and partly with their failure to fully cover the bus\u2019s\nfading paint and patches of rust. Fara took a window seat, strictly\nto avoid unwanted eye contact with other passengers; there was nothing\nin the street scene to rivet her interest. Fara\u2019s origin,\nroute and destination were not in the neatly upholstered fraction\nof Dhaka occupied by tourists and the city\u2019s small middle\nclass. Two-thirds of the population lived in a vast warren of unlined\nblacktop and paving brick, abutted by mostly one and two-story structures,\neach of which might have been built to code, below code or by squatters\nwith shack-making skills. The bus crept along its route, quicker\nthan pedestrians and the older bicycle-driven rickshaws, a little\nslower than motor vehicles of a more agile species. A few times,\nopen-air markets on either side of the street, illegal and unpunished,\ncreated a temporary bottleneck. In the streets, there were repeated\nassertions of individuality amid the mass of unplanned human life:\nlush scalp and facial hair, cheap jewelry, clothing too gaudy or\nscanty for strict tastes, slogans and ornamental trappings on the\nvehicles and jerry-built housing. HERE I AM, MY EXISTENCE MATTERS\nwas a refrain trying to be heard above ten million close-packed,\ndeafening heartbeats.\nIt never occurred to Fara to mention her out-of-body\nexperiences to anyone else. Even if they believed her (she thought\nit much likelier she would be considered crazy and therefore unweddable),\nFara enjoyed having a great secret, the only one she\u2019d ever\nhad. Otherwise her life was so intertwined with her family that,\nwhen she was living on the farm, they could all tell she was last\nto go to the outdoor privy from the color of her stool. What troubled\nher now was that her flights from the Dhaka slums were becoming\nless frequent and harder to maintain. Three or four times a week,\na visitor bearing sights and sounds from strange places had called\non her, waiting until freedom from routine let her answer. Almost\nalways she had no chance to do so until bedtime. The contact ended\nspontaneously after a few hours but no outside reaction could disrupt\nit; Fara\u2019s parents and siblings marveled at what a sound sleeper\nshe was. Now she counted herself lucky if the visitor came once\na week, and any loud noise or other stimulus could intrude itself\nand sever the contact.\nFara got off right outside her workplace, a jute\nmill that was one of the few large buildings near her home. Entering\nby the women\u2019s door, she joined eighty other women in cutting,\nsewing and labeling sacks from bolts of burlap produced by the mill\u2019s\nmale employees. Most of Fara\u2019s coworkers were younger women\nsupporting families, not unlike herself, and they shared an easy\ncomradeship devoid of intimacy. Fara was due to leave in a few more\nweeks and expected she would actually miss the place. The rotating\nwork assignments were never that demanding and left her time for\nher own thoughts. Fara knew it was much easier work than harvesting\nthe jute. Mujib was too young to assist when the family owned their\nfour-acre lot in the village and Father was too proud to let the\nwomen help him. He did it all himself, standing in muddy water,\nhacking through the tough jute fibers and letting them steep in\nthe paddies until the horribly sticky resin dissolved.\nFara\u2019s shift ended at four and she went\nstraight home. After checking to see that Hasina and Mujib were\nsafely accounted for, Fara did her afternoon housework. Halfway\nthrough the monthly chore of beating the drapes and mats, she sensed\nthe faraway pull, too familiar to mistake. Twice in twenty-four\nhours was unusual in the past and a near-miracle now. Fara knew,\nof course, that she couldn\u2019t respond until she put in a long\nevening. Father always brought home groceries and jute sticks for\nthe stove, and tonight he also brought Tikka, Fara\u2019s intended\nhusband.\nFara: \u201cClear away, sister. I\u2019ll bring\nout the shemai.\u201d\nFather: \u201cYou know Tikka doesn\u2019t care\nfor sweets.\u201d\nTikka: \u201cWho told you that? Don\u2019t take\nthe dinner mat. Fara, hurry back!\u201d\nEvery Thursday evening saw the same tug of war\nin Fara\u2019s house -- Father wanted dinner to end quickly so\nTikka could join him in the men-only area of the downstairs common\nroom, and Tikka wanted to linger in the company of Fara. Fara and\nTikka had been neighbors in the old village and Tikka\u2019s family\nmoved voluntarily to the city, as Fara\u2019s did by compulsion\na few months later. Tikka was meant to get the best education possible\nand certainly rose to the opportunity, earning top grades in his\nhigh school science courses. Soon to graduate college as a civil\nengineer, he had already secured promises of full-time work, that\nbeing the main conversational topic of the evening. Fara thought\nhe would be an easy man to live with and long ago lost her aversion\nto the queer double depression in his jaw, made years earlier by\nthe hoof of an ill-tempered ox. Tikka, for his part, didn\u2019t\nmind what another man might have considered a financially disadvantageous\nmarriage. He loved Fara in a romanticized Western fashion; marrying\nher was on his mind long before their parents broached the subject.\nAfter dinner, Father turned on the radio -- the\nonly electrical appliance in the house apart from the lamps -- and\ntuned in a soccer match. Fara surrendered Tikka and joined the children\nat prayers before sending them to bed. She wanted to be in bed too.\nShe felt bone-weary and long overdue to answer the visitor\u2019s\ncall. Instead she spent two full hours puttering around the house\ntill Tikka\u2019s departure. Father and Tikka took their soccer\nseriously and Fara wouldn\u2019t chance having contact broken by\nthe cheers and groans coming from the common room. At last, the\nhouse quiet, Fara settled into bed. It took twenty, thirty, forty\nseconds of hard mental effort, but the visitor had waited patiently.\nThere was no audio element this time; Fara was\nbecalmed in total vacuum. A moment later she resolved a black sky\nwith thousands of stars undimmed by any planetary atmosphere. In\nthe figurative near ground, a brilliant object grew steadily nearer.\nFara had searched for them with her own eyes while standing on the\nsoil of Earth, so she knew perfectly what a comet looked like. This\none was multinucleate, its disparate clumps of metal, rock, water\nand organic compounds held together by the feeblest gravitational\nattraction. The tail radiated from the coma in broadly angled streaks\nlike the spikes of a foxtail burr, each one dispersing a spoonful\nof solid matter into a hundred thousand kilometers of luminescent\nglory. Were it to impact on an Earth-like planet, the water and\norganics borne on the comet could help spark the start of life.\nFara rotated her vision to see where the comet was going and saw\nit was fated otherwise.\nLooming in front of the comet was the sunlit disk\nof a giant planet, girdled with green and violet striations. The\nplanet lacked the mass needed to become a star, but its gravity\nwas great enough to have pulled countless smaller bodies into collision\norbits during its life. The comet had swung around its sun fifteen\nthousand times before an accident of celestial mechanics dictated\nits capture by the gas giant. Fara moved her vantage point so she\nwas right next to the comet\u2019s coma and traveling in exact\nparallel. The collision was only minutes away and the comet seemed\nto be emitting a faint, unaccountable ticking sound -- no, not the\nalarm clock! Fara redoubled her concentration and the vision in\nspace didn\u2019t fade away; the alarm clock did.\nThe comet\u2019s tail was pushed by solar pressure\nstraight toward the planet. When the tail streamers began to brush\nthe planet\u2019s surface, Fara halted where she was, respective\nto the planet\u2014it was the perfect spot to observe the collision.\nSeveral times she had witnessed comets and asteroids hitting a planet\nlike this, always on the night side. Every time there was a localized\nglow at the point of impact, visible without solar illumination.\nAt most, the only other reaction was a barely perceptible band of\ncolor working around the dayside like gentle rippling on water far\nfrom a dropped stone. This time Fara would miss nothing.\nThe coma drew closer to the planet; the planet\u2019s\nsurface was still undisturbed. As the coma edged into the outer\natmosphere, a kernel of canary yellow appeared in the center of\nthe coma\u2019s diaphanous whiteness, caused by combustion of the\nnuclear material. Fara thought she could see the kernel start to\nbreak up, and then the nuclei reached the denser inner atmosphere.\nThe planet\u2019s green and violet covering began to part, peeling\nback to reveal a bright crimson underlayer...and that was the last\nthing Fara saw. She was yanked back to her bedroom by an uncontrollable\nfit of shivering.\nFara knew now why she felt so tired before getting\ninto bed. It was an attack of the flu, for which Fara hadn\u2019t\nreceived an inoculation in her entire life. She got up and got the\ntwo winter blankets out of the bureau. Despite the darkness and\nher trembling, she managed to align the blankets edge-to-edge and\nlay them neatly over her pallet. She slipped in under the sheet\nand readied herself for a very cheerless night.\nThe loss of a weekend to illness wasn\u2019t\nthe calamity to Fara that it would have been to a woman in a developed\nnation, or for that matter, a man in her own nation. The absence\nof labor-saving devices forced an accumulation of housework during\nthe week; the practical result was that Fara had a work schedule\njust as crowded on Friday and Saturday, though she logged all that\ntime at home without earning a single taka. Hasina filled in for\nher the next two days, quite rightly in Fara\u2019s opinion, since\nthe passing of a few more weeks would see Hasina doing this labor\nevery day. Fara never got so well rested as when she was sick and\nshe smiled inwardly through her fever and chills, thinking that\nanytime a vagrant germ wanted to single her out was acceptable to\nher.\nFara woke Sunday morning with a lingering headache\nand decided that wouldn\u2019t stop her from putting in a day at\nthe jute mill. The cataract visible through her window was bad news\u2014the\nmonsoon season had come early. Fara flung on some clothes and hurried\ndownstairs to the backyard kitchen garden. It was the only one immediately\nnear because the buildings around Fara\u2019s house fully occupied\ntheir lots or because the city-bred residents put their yards to\nother use. Fara drew plastic sheeting over the strawberry plants\nin their clay tubs. The other produce would have to cope.\nFather assured Fara last night that Hasina had\nmanaged the house perfectly in her absence. When Fara went to the\nkitchen, she found Father was mistaken in at least one particular:\nHasina hadn\u2019t cleaned the stove of ash all weekend. Breakfast\nwas delayed and everyone got off to a late start, made worse by\nthe necessity of donning slickers and galoshes before leaving the\nhouse.\nFara\u2019s paycheck was cropped twice that day, once when she\ncame to work on a late bus and again when the electric sewing machines\nall stopped chattering at once. Fara and twenty other women ate\ntheir ramen early while the problem was repaired. It took forty-seven\nminutes more than the duration of a lunch break and the mill paid\nnothing for work not done, no matter what the cause.\nFara\u2019s bad luck continued after work. Standing in line to\nboard the bus, she saw that the driver was an oversexed fiftyish\nman who gave her nothing but trouble in the past. She couldn\u2019t\ntake the next bus; the rain was still pouring down and the mill\nowners wouldn\u2019t let her wait inside.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s been a long time since\nI saw you last.\u201d\nFara dodged his pawing and paid the toll box at the same time. She\ntook a seat well back in the bus, expecting no further outrages\nduring the ride home. Wrong; the driver, a patronage employee who\nwould keep his job regardless of any misconduct, made sport of Fara\u2019s\nsinuous walk by slinking the bus from one side of the street to\nthe other. Diminished traffic in the heavy rain allowed him to do\nthis without killing anyone, but people all along the route were\ndrenched with water thrown up by the bus. This was too much for\nFara to take and she got off one stop early, using the side exit.\nFrom there it was a whole kilometer of sloshing through shin-deep\nwater to her house.\nOnce safely home, Fara went directly to the garden,\nstill in her rain gear. The current crop of staple vegetables was\nsubmerged, with the harvest date two weeks away. Fara waded into\nthe vegetable plots, cut the tomatoes and pulled up the onions.\nShe would try canning a big batch of green tomato and spring onion\nchutney tomorrow, lacking a better idea. The potatoes and yams might\ncome through if the water level dropped soon, so Fara left them\nalone.\nFara was sewing a button on one of Mujib\u2019s\nshirts when Father\u2019s motorcycle pulled in. It wasn\u2019t\neven six o\u2019clock.\n\u201cYou\u2019re back early.\u201d\n\u201cToo much water; it might throttle the engine.\nI\u2019ll unlash our boat in the morning. It could be the only\nway to get around if the streets get any higher.\u201d\nFara noted with pleasure that the nightly bag\nof groceries included shrimp, an infrequent luxury item. She got\ndinner underway, and right after stirring the shrimp into a stovetop\npilaf, she left the kitchen to investigate raised voices in the\ndining area. Mujib had been scolded for coming to school late and\nwaited until now to shower invective on the nominal cause, Hasina.\nNormally his sister was a family peacekeeper willing to accept due\ncriticism, but not tonight. After much refereeing, Fara returned\nto the kitchen to find the rice had a tough bottom crust and the\nshrimp were badly overdone. Father ate the ruined dinner without\ncomplaining. The children refocused their anger on Fara.\n\u201cWhat did you do to these shrimp, Fara?\nThey taste like tire shavings!\u201d\n\u201cWhatever cookbook gave you the recipe for\nthis, don\u2019t let me read it, alright?\u201d\nFara chose to say something in her defense...and\nthe visitor returned, entreating, desperate for her attention. Fara\nswallowed her last bite of the scorched rice and said:\n\u201cGo to bed, you two. Go now.\u201d\nAfter a short, poisonous silence, Hasina and Mujib\nmounted the stairs to their bedrooms. Father said nothing; he had\nnever second-guessed his wife when she disciplined the children\nand he elected to show the same courtesy to his grown daughter.\nFara took the uneaten food to the backyard fertilizer tub, grateful\nfor the undiscriminating tastes of stalks and tubers.\nFather retired early. Paying no attention to her\nsister\u2019s scornfully presented back on the other pallet, Fara\nchanged into her nightshirt, slid under the sheet and let the visitor\u2019s\noffering sweep over her.\nAgain there was no audio component and Fara didn\u2019t care at\nall, not when there was so much to see. Her vantage point was a\nfew light-minutes from the perimeter of a huge billowing cloud of\nstraw-colored gas\u2014a nebula. Facing into it, she noticed it\nwas receding from her and concluded this was the effect of reverse\nchronology, something she was no stranger to. Fara wasn\u2019t\nalways treated to visions of otherwhere happening in real time;\noften she saw events taking thousands or millions of terrestrial\nyears, squashed into hours; twice time was halted completely so\nshe could survey the generation of celestial bodies with the rapt\npassion of someone present at a privileged moment. Fara guessed\nit was not an act of creation she was watching now.\nShe moved forward very quickly, plunging in almost\nto the heart of the coalescing cloud. Glowing wisps of stellar gas,\nin a profusion of geometric and organic forms, were all around Fara.\nShe rotated her vision in place, trying to follow the continually\ndissolving tracery of crescents, forks, spirals, arrows, hoops,\nleaves, all created from the mass of a giant star and interacting\nin a riot of ever-changing visual associations that would trivialize\nthe lifetime effort of a hundred Alexander Calders.\nThe gases were getting denser, packing in too\nthickly to let Fara keep watching the monumental show of mobile\nsculpture. A distant rumble, like a conch shell held to the ear,\nbegan in the compacting medium. A few seconds later, the trailing\nedge of a supernova\u2019s wave front leaped in upon Fara. She\nthrew her right arm up to protect her eyes, out of reflex; the part\nof Fara that mattered, thousands of parsecs distant, knew this and\nstayed where it was, contact still firm and unendangered. Fara turned\nher vantage in the dazzling white surround toward what she imagined\nwas the center of its volume and inched forward. A few subjective\nminutes of progress ended in an abrupt halt; she came to the edge\nof a rapidly contracting black sphere and had no time to ponder\nher next move before the singularity, regressed into nonexistence,\nspewed out a colossal red-orange gout of superheated hydrogen. Fara\ncouldn\u2019t help being terrified for all her knowledge she would\ncome to no harm. It wasn\u2019t the scrumptious fear that brought\nher back to the world her body occupied, or the dragon roar of the\nreversed implosion. It was the sound of tapping on glass, on her\nown bedroom window.\nFara heard her sister scream and opened her eyes.\nThere in the window was a face, shining, misshapen, and after the\ninitial shock, wholly familiar. Tikka had somehow gotten a ladder\nor something else to stand on and was pointing a flashlight at himself.\nWhat he needed at this hour was a mystery to Fara. His apparition\nat the window brought on Hasina\u2019s screaming and Fara wanted\nto scream as well\u2014not from fear. When the vision fled, there\nwas a horrid feeling of finality about it. Fara couldn\u2019t have\nsaid how she knew this. It was as though the visitor, in departing,\nhad angrily slammed a door behind him. The immediate, teeming world\nwhere she ate and slept and toiled to get through each day was the\nonly one Fara would ever know again, and even her mother\u2019s\ndeath hadn\u2019t affected her so. Fara surprised herself with\nher own strength; not allowing a moment\u2019s pause, she got out\nof bed for a civil exchange with the person responsible for her\nloss.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Tikka. Don\u2019t be frightened,\nsister. Go back to sleep.\u201d\nFara opened the window, fortunately a sliding\nwindow or Tikka would have been knocked into the flooded street.\nHe shone the flashlight on Fara.\n\u201cFara, the house was dark. I had to see\nyou.\u201d\n\u201cHave you seen enough?\u201d Fara knew\nhow sheer her nightshirt was.\n\u201cI just got word you were sick. I had to\nsee how you were, and besides that...Fara, they\u2019re sending\nme away for a whole month. It\u2019s a requirement for engineering\nmajors. I\u2019ll be with a field crew, inspecting foundations,\nfixing earthworks, anything else they want me to do. We\u2019ll\nbe apart all that time.\u201d\nIt would be by far Tikka\u2019s longest absence\nsince Fara\u2019s family moved to Dhaka and she could easily imagine\nhow loathsome it was to Tikka. To have Fara always near was his\ndream, one that drove his schoolwork and every major decision of\nhis life.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll really miss me that much?\u201d\n\u201cYou know I will.\u201d\nThe mood of urgency had waned enough for Fara\nto do something about the flashlight blazing in her face.\n\u201cGive me that.\u201d\nFara took the light out of Tikka\u2019s hand\nand turned it off. Tikka was glad to relinquish it; now he could\ngrip the tottering ladder with both hands.\n\u201cJust one month, Fara. I get my diploma\nright after that and we can be married.\u201d\nMarried. Fara knew she would live better as the\nwife of a gainfully employed engineer, even after feeding the numerous\nmouths Tikka would expect her to bring into the world. What else\nwas there? Tikka was content to pass his allotted days in a continuation\nof his present existence, the one he\u2019d always known. Fara\nhad known something else, larger and more entrancing than Tikka,\nFather or anyone else had imagined. There was no substitute for\nit, none at all.\nUnless...\n\u201cFara, what are you doing?\u201d\nFara had turned the flashlight back on and held\nit to one side of Tikka\u2019s head. For thousands of hours she\nhad seen Tikka and should have had nothing new to appreciate in\nhis malformed face, now beaded with rain. Instead she was looking\nat him intensely, moving the source of the beam to bring fresh shadow\nand highlight patterns into relief. Seeking outward was denied to\nFara; desperation moved her to find the beauty and savor of strange\nvistas where she had never thought to look before.\n|\n|\n______\n|\n||\n|\n______","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}

They examined\none another with open curiosity. Outside of Darwin, the linguist,\nnone of the Earthmen had ever dealt with Diatoms before. They were\nin a remote corner of the star cluster and contacts with them had\nbeen few. Van Buren believed his was the first expedition of any\nreal scope to pay them a visit. Previous missions had all been strictly\nscientific in nature.\n\u201cAll right, Darwin,\u201d Van Buren turned\nto the linguist, \u201clet\u2019s get the ball rolling here. Is\nthere any sort of ceremonial greeting or ritual we have to go through?\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear so.\u201d Darwin\nshrugged his shoulders. \u201cApparently the Diatoms don\u2019t\ngo in for such things.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Van Buren exclaimed. That\nwas a relief. He had been on other expeditions where three-quarters\nof the time was wasted indulging the natives in some fool ritual\nor other. It was a good sign that the Diatoms didn\u2019t go in\nfor such nonsense. Van Buren examined the aliens without appearing\nto do so. They were squat, gnome-like creatures, heavy-boned and\nslow in their movements. Their skin had a peculiar marbled quality\nto it, blue and pale grey. They were ugly, certainly, but not aggressively\nso.\n\u201cWhich one is in charge?\u201d Van Buren\nsaid to the linguist. \u201cWho\u2019s the one we\u2019re dealing\nwith?\u201d\n\u201cThat one, with the pattern of red dye on\nhis face.\u201d Darwin nodded discreetly. \u201cThe dye represents\na symbol of his authority. The others are bound by some form of\nallegiance. I haven\u2019t wholly figured out their social system\nas yet. But he\u2019s the one running the show, no doubt about\nthat.\u201d\nVan Buren nodded. This was another favorable development.\nHe had dealt with other alien cultures where nobody was in charge,\nwhere a kind of socialist equality pervaded the entire society:\nevery individual was every other individual\u2019s equal. It was\nimpossible to get anything done in such a case. The natives would\ndebate endlessly and the more they debated the further any chances\nof reaching a decision receded into the distance.\n\u201cO.K. Tell him . . .\u201d Van Buren paused,\nlooked at the Diatom. \u201cWhat is his name by the way?\u201d\nThe linguist addressed a question to the head Diatom in the harsh,\nguttural tongue of the natives. \u201cAs far as I can make out,\u201d\nDarwin pursed his lips, \u201can approximate English rendering\nwould be Ibid.\u201d\n\u201cIbid?\u201d Van Buren repeated doubtfully.\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d\n\u201cAs I said,\u201d the linguist gave a small,\ntight smile, \u201cthat would be an approximate rendering. The\ncorrelation between the two tongues is not at all exact.\u201d\nVan Buren made a face. \u201cIbid, then. Tell\nIbid that we come in peace and that we hope to discover whether\nthere might be some sort of goods they would be interested in trading.\nTell him that we have many useful and intriguing items which they\ncould not get or manufacture for themselves. We can arrange to extend\na line of credit initially to help with any purchases, if they so\ndesire. Of course, our sole intent in any transaction is to establish\na relationship that would mutually benefit both parties,\u201d\nVan Buren added.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Darwin repeated, his\nface studiously blank. He turned to the Diatom, translated. The\nDiatom scowled. He scratched his ear then spat out a quick stream\nof guttural noises that sounded like abuse.\n\u201cThe Diatom wishes to know,\u201d Darwin\ntranslated, \u201cwhat exactly a line of credit consists of.\u201d\nVan Buren smiled. One of the principal objects\nof the initial negotiations was to discover just how financially\nastute members of the alien culture were. Those who were not well\nversed in the intricacies of finance, well, he would undertake to\nguide and instruct them. Naturally, in the exercise of this office,\ncertain advantages would accrue to him.\n\u201cA line of credit means that you could purchase\nan item without paying for it up front,\u201d Van Buren explained.\n\u201cThe money would be repaid over a certain period of time,\nto be worked out in advance. Of course, interest would accumulate\non that part of it still due and payable. In effect, we are loaning\nyou the money.\u201d\nThe Diatom barked something short and sharp. \u201cExplain interest,\u201d\nDarwin translated.\nVan Buren frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly\nhow he said it \u2013 explain interest, like that?\u201d Darwin\nnodded. \u201cIs he attempting to be rude?\u201d\n\u201cI think that is simply the Diatom\u2019s\nstyle,\u201d the linguist suggested. \u201cBlunt and direct. I\nwouldn\u2019t attempt to read anything into it. Some peoples rely\non circumlocution and subterfuge.\u201d The linguist\u2019s expression\nwas now laced with irony. \u201cOthers don\u2019t. The Diatoms\napparently believe in saying just what they mean, without dressing\nit up for effect. I think we\u2019ll have to take them as they\nare.\u201d\nVan Buren shrugged. He turned to the Diatom. \u201cInterest,\u201d\nhe said and paused, considering, \u201cinterest is the cost assessed\nfor a service. In this case, a loan extended to a borrower. In technical\nterms it could be defined as the time value of money, projected\ninto the future.\u201d Van Buren smiled at the Diatom pleasantly.\n\u201cIt is a fairly simple concept, really.\u201d\nThe Diatom said something in a low tone. Van Buren\nturned to the linguist.\n\u201cUh, the Diatom says why would you go to\nall this trouble . . .\u201d Darwin paused, shook his head. \u201cNo,\ntrouble doesn\u2019t really capture the essence of what he said.\nThe word he used has much stronger overtones. There are certain\nscatological implications.\u201d Darwin ran his fingers through\nhis hair. \u201cI\u2019m afraid there isn\u2019t an English equivalent.\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d Van Buren brushed this\naside, \u201cjust give me the gist of what he said. I don\u2019t\nneed an exact translation.\u201d\n\u201cHe says, why go to this kind of trouble\nto complete a simple transaction.\u201d\nVan Buren turned to the Diatom, speaking eagerly.\n\u201cIt would be totally wrong to regard this as trouble. If I\nleft you with such an impression it is the fault of language barriers\nand does not in any sense reflect on the intrinsic merit of the\nidea. Advancing you the money is a financing technique which enables\nyou to purchase something you would not otherwise be able to afford.\nIt extends to you options which, were you to live solely within\nyour means, would not be available to you.\u201d\nThe Diatoms danced about in agitation when Darwin finished translating\nthis. Some of Van Buren\u2019s men adopted a defensive posture,\nletting their hands rest on the stocks of their weapons. These little\nparleys did not always end in an agreeable manner.\nThe head Diatom strode back and forth, gesturing\nemphatically. Darwin translated.\n\u201cHe asks why he should wish to buy something\nhe can not afford. If he can not afford it, plainly he is better\noff not buying it. It goes against . . . something. I don\u2019t\nknow what he\u2019s saying. It would seem we have stumbled upon\na fiscal conservative, Director.\u201d A ghost of a smile hovered\nabout Darwin\u2019s lips.\nVan Buren threw up his hands in frustration. \u201cFiscal\nconservative? A financial illiterate is what he is. Doesn\u2019t\nunderstand a thing. The simplest notion and he takes it and turns\nit on its head. What can you do with such imbeciles?\u201d\n\u201cDo you wish me to translate that?\u201d\nDarwin inquired blandly.\nVan Buren threw him a black look. \u201cHere,\u201d\nhe directed one of the men, \u201chaul that box forward. Let\u2019s\nshow him what we\u2019ve got to trade. Maybe something in there\nwill catch his fancy. I think I know what\u2019ll do it, too.\u201d\nThe man dragged the box forward, grunting. Van\nBuren opened it. He took out a large growth of fungus, held it up.\n\u201cThe mushrooms of Apogee,\u201d he began\nhis pitch. \u201cHeld to be a great delicacy by the epicures of\nseveral worlds. There\u2019s nothing in any cuisine, anywhere,\nthat compares with them. There is no diet they won\u2019t either\ncomplement or enhance. In addition they possess certain medicinal\nqualities I\u2019ll be happy to elaborate upon. And,\u201d Van\nBuren smiled, winked lewdly, \u201cthey are accounted by many as\nthe sole true aphrodisiac anywhere in the galaxy.\u201d Van Buren\nextended the mushroom toward the head Diatom.\nIbid hesitated, directed a subordinate to fetch\nthe mushroom. He broke off a hunk of the fungus, sniffed at it.\nHis face contorted wrathfully. \u201cShnaztek,\u201d he pronounced\nand cast it aside in disgust.\nThere was an ominous murmur from Van Buren\u2019s\nmen. The mushroom of Apogee was revered amongst them, held in such\nesteem that men were known to have killed to obtain it.\n\u201cEasy,\u201d Van Buren cautioned. He turned\nto the linguist. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d\n\u201cAn expletive,\u201d Darwin said. \u201cA\nforceful and impolite expression of contempt. Roughly equivalent\nto our \u2018This is shit\u2019.\u201d The men stirred in agitation,\ngripping their weapons.\n\u201cStand down, Van Buren ordered them. \u201cStand\ndown, I said.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThey are savages,\nsavages. Imagine anyone reacting as they have. Obviously, nothing\nwe propose to offer will appeal to them. They haven\u2019t obtained\na level of culture sufficient to appreciate anything more sophisticated\nthan nettles and fungo berries.\u201d Darwin said nothing.\n\u201cThere is one thing,\u201d Van Buren reflected.\nHis eyes became dark, calculating. \u201cYes, we do have one item.\nI think . . .\u201d He shot a glance at Darwin. he did not entirely\ntrust the linguist. He was too much of an intellectual, his perspective\nwas always too broad and sympathetic. His allegiance did not lie\nstrictly with the success of the mission as it should but rather\nwith some vague concept that embraced qualities of compassion and\nfairness. His training and disposition essentially left him unfit\nfor a venture of this nature. But, of course, they could not function\nwithout him.\n\u201cYou and you!\u201d Van Buren pointed to\ntwo of his men. \u201cGo check on the cache of weapons. Bring me\na sixty angstrom laser pistol and a thermopile resonating detonator.\nWe\u2019re going to up the ante here a little.\u201d\nDarwin looked at Van Buren, startled. \u201cWait just a minute,\nDirector. Unless I am mistaken, you are proposing to sell weapons\nto the Diatoms. Is that correct?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m considering it,\u201d Van Buren\nsaid. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re familiar with the relevant\nstatutes,\u201d Darwin upbraided him. \u201cThat\u2019s in direct\ncontravention of several articles of the Reichenbach Charter.\u201d\nThe laws governing the sale of weapons to non-human\ncultures were strict and specific. They outlined in detail what\ntechnology could be sold, under what circumstances, and to whom.\nGiven the enormous thrust of the weapons industry and the ready\nmarket for it it was necessary to regulate with great exactitude\nwhat was permissible and what was not. Van Buren, of course, was\nwell aware of this.\n\u201cI\u2019m perhaps stretching the limits\nof the law a little,\u201d Van Buren admitted. \u201cSometimes\nthat\u2019s necessary. Out here the law does not carry the same\nforce that it does in the more settled parts of the galaxy. In a\nsense, it is we who determine what the law is \u2013 and what it\nis not.\u201d\nDarwin shook his head. \u201cThe law, this law\nin particular, is not something you can twist and alter at your\nwhim. You can not finesse it away and you can not plead special\ncircumstances. There are very compelling reasons for a law such\nas this. Reasons of which you are well aware, Director.\u201d\n\u201cIf I am not mistaken Darwin, your field\nof specialty is linguistics. I don\u2019t recollect your being\nassigned as legal advisor to this mission. In fact,\u201d Van Buren\u2019s\neyes shone with a hard light, \u201cI am quite certain that function\nfalls within my purview and not your own. If I wish your counsel\non this matter I will invite it. I don\u2019t appreciate it being\noffered gratuitously.\u201d\n\u201cI think you should know, Director,\u201d\nDarwin stared back at Van Buren with equal determination, \u201cthat\nif you propose to go through with this my services will not be available.\nYou will be on your own.\u201d\nVan Buren\u2019s face flooded with color. \u201cI\nhave your contract,\u201d he said harshly. \u201cIf you violate\nthe terms of that contract I shall have you expelled from the guild.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if you violate the terms of the Charter\nas you are proposing,\u201d Darwin thrust his face forward, \u201cI\nshall have you hauled before a tribunal and indicted.\u201d Van\nBuren took a step forward, his fists clenched. The two men glared\nat one another.\nIbid, forgotten all this while, directed a question\nat Darwin. The linguist glanced up, startled. It took him a moment\nto grasp what the Diatom had said.\n\u201cWhat is it? What does he want?\u201d Van\nBuren demanded.\n\u201cHe wishes to know . . . The man smoking\nthe cigarette \u2013 he has never seen such a thing before.\u201d\n\u201cNo?\u201d Van Buren looked at the Diatom\nspeculatively. \u201cHollis, step up here for\na minute. Let him see the cigarette.\u201d\nHollis stepped forward. He held the cigarette\nout so that the Diatom could examine it. The tip burned redly in\nthe oxygen-rich atmosphere and a thin curl of smoke drifted up into\nthe air. The Diatoms stared at it, fascinated.\n\u201cAll right now Hollis, smoke it. Demonstrate\nwhat it\u2019s designed for.\u201d Hollis took a drag on the cigarette,\nembarrassed by the unaccustomed attention. \u201cNot like that,\ndamn it!\u201d Van Buren scowled. \u201cThis is a sales pitch!\nMake like you are in an ad back home. You want to convey an image\nof hipness and sophistication. The cigarette lends you an air of\ndistinction and glamour you would never be able to achieve on your\nown.\u201d\nHollis immediately adopted a Jimmy Dean-type swagger.\nHis lip curled in a defiant sneer. The cigarette dangled from the\ncorner of his mouth, letting everyone know that he was not to be\nmessed with, that he was one bad, hombre. The Diatoms clustered\naround him in open admiration, making inarticulate grunts of approval.\n\u201cDo you see that, Darwin?\u201d Van Buren\ndeclared triumphantly. \u201cIt was only a matter of time before\nwe discovered a product that the Diatoms wanted. The first rule\nof any good salesman is: create a demand for what you are selling.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter whether your product is utterly frivolous\nand unnecessary \u2013 make them want it. Thus, the cigarette.\u201d\nHollis was totally into his role now as tobacco aficionado and when\nhe blew a perfect smoke ring followed by another, smaller one, that\nbarreled through the center of the first, the Diatoms actually began\nto dance around him, shouting their enthusiasm.\n\u201cI\u2019ll make a fortune,\u201d Van Buren\nexclaimed to no one in particular. \u201cExcise taxes. Import duties,\na hundred percent mark up \u2013 Hell, why not two hundred percent?!\nI\u2019ll bleed them white. I\u2019ll fleece them of every nickel\nthey ever owned and have them thanking me for the favor of doing\nso.\u201d\nDarwin watched this spectacle with sad eyes, wishing\nto disassociate himself from the entire proceeding. He had entered\ninto his career holding the highest of ideals, committed to spreading\nunderstanding and fostering sympathy and good will amongst different\npeoples. And what had he become \u2013 a pitchman for predatory\ncapitalism, a purveyor of poisons and filth. He resembled one of\nthose hucksters on late night Visiscreen, relentlessly hawking their\nproducts, appealing to the basest, most puerile instincts of their\naudience. And winning out \u2013 even as Van Buren was about to\nwin out. A tiny flame of rebellion kindled in Darwin\u2019s soul.\nWhen the negotiations resumed again he gave Van\nBuren a reassuring smile and nod. He spoke in a confident, winning\nfashion, employing all of his skills and knowledge of the Diatom\ntongue. \u201cIn my culture, amongst my people, cigarettes are\nrenowned for two distinct features \u2013 nicotine and carcinogens.\nLet me explain.\u201d\nDarwin set the match to the fuse and waited to\nsee what would happen.\n|\n|\n______\n|\n||\n|\n______","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}

She was glad to be working.\nBarring any unforeseen difficulties, her entire student loan would\nbe paid off in 58 years. Thankfully, she would not be awake the\nentire time; she planned to hibernate, cryogenically or otherwise.\nSee, Tammi Tucker was the Cap'n of a space ship -- a cargo\nship -- and could do anything she wanted.\nThe ship's crew consisted of herself and a friendly computer. So far, her nine-hundred tons of cargo consisted solely of woodchips. It was going to be used to make furniture, like intelligent chairs and tables, for everybody in a big geodesic dome called Wallmart 6, on a planet someplace.\nTammi had never been to Wallmart 6 before. She was told that it was like Wallmart 5,4,3,2, and 1; which is to say, it was just like any other prefabricated colony on the crummy, outer-system planets.\nHer spaceship was half a kilometer in length, but her cabin -- the only cabin on the entire cargo vessel -- was about ten long steps across.\nIt was crammed with a bunch of stuff.\nIt\nkinda sucked.\nHer spaceship was called The 4008, MEDIUM, EXTRA, WOODCHIP, ONE.\nNever sign a contract you haven't read.\nHer first month in space went by kind of slow.\nHer first month in space kinda felt like two months in space.\nMost of the time she spent playing videogames, reading books, eating delicious reconstituted food, exercising, composing haikus, pacing, watching movies, learning how to salsa, trying novel drug combinations, trying new yoga positions, mediating, skipping, prancing, watching numbers change on consoles, watching meters fluctuate on displays, reading manuals, having showers, having stand-up baths, enjoying massages, having breaks, sitting around doing nothing -- or maybe fiddling her thumbs, planning to buy things, complaining, cheering her favorite tennis players, and other things; sometimes she would: contemplate the meaning of existence, design new synthetic purses, make artificial life forms, simulate interplanetary wars, or pretend she was having a tea with someone famous (she would dress up the ship's cleaning robot up in silly hats made out of reconstituted food from the dispensary, and this would suffice as costuming); on very rare occasions, she got drunk and played Scrabble, by herself, which was, very nearly, impossible to enjoy.\nThings got old quick.\nSo, she decided to spend most of her time in a drug-induced coma. This is what most people decide to do, after awhile, in similar circumstances.\nTammi was mandated to wake up every sixty days and make sure everything was kosher with the computer and the ship and the woodchips and everything.\nThe first wake-up went really straightforward:\n...she felt like she had a nasty hangover; the cabin spun a little, then slowed, then stabilized. She surveyed her surroundings. Nothing had changed. At all. \"Computer?\"\n\"Yup!\" said the computer.\n\"Is everything kosher?\"\n\"Yuupp!\" said the computer. \"Everything is kosher!\"\n\"Good stuff.\" Tammi plunked her feet on the heated floor. Tammi put her feet back on the bed. \"Put me back under.\"\n\"You betcha! Here's some Vivocain!\" the computer put her back under.\n\"Hmm...vibleocain...\" she mumbled.\n...she felt like she had a vengeful hangover; the cabin annoyed her, with each passing second, as she climbed out of bed, and struggled over to her chair. She collapsed into the chair with a good amount of gusto. As if, she had not just woken up, but instead, just climbed something really tall, and had finally gotten to the peak, where a tiger was waiting to be wrestled, and there was a cameraman from Time magazine there, who was waiting for the perfect photo-opportunity, for six years, and was all ready to go, now that a perfect subject had arrived... one with gusto.\nGusto.\nTammi belched.\n\"Good afternoon Tammi,\" the disembodied computer voice said.\n\"Hey.\"\n\"Want something to eat?\"\n\"Lamb. A big pile of lamb. With mint sauce,\" Tammi climbed out of the chair. \"And potatoes.\" She stared at the skipping rope on the floor -- nope. \"And...some peanuts.\" She stared at the digital book on the magazine rack - nope. \"And maybe some Brazil nuts, okay?\" Tammi climbed into the half-closet-sized shower, and turned it on, glad that she was already naked, as she would not have to endear the tedium of stripping.\n\"Sounds fantastic Tammi, I'll make that for you,\" the computer said.\nThe food-box started to gurgle and make funny sounds. It started to shake a bit. And whir.\nTammi stuck her head under a stream of water. \"Ah,\" she said. The shower did her wonders, and by the time she got out, dried off and put on a smock, her meal was waiting for her.\nA little conveyor belt protruded from the food-box; a little convey of tasty shapes came out.\n\"Mmm...lamb,\" Tammi said, trying to figure out which bit was which on her plate. The lamb had to be the large, gelatinous brown cube with green drizzle-goo, no doubt, and the potatoes, well, they had to be the little white spheres, that looked liked little eggs; by elimination, that meant that the little yellow nugget things were the nuts, although pea or Brazilian, she had no chance of guessing.\nFortunately, the meal tasted much better than it looked.\nThen there was trouble.\n\"Oh boy,\" the computer said. \"It looks like an esmail just arrived for you.\"\nTammi set down her glass of ersatz lager, and pushed the Scrabbles letters X, B, I, K, and O aside, disgusted. She wiggled a bit in her chair -- tried to get comfortable -- then stopped, giving up completely. \"An esmail? From who?\"\n\"A certain A'reef-gooma-koa, it looks like.\"\nTammi's heart skipped a beat. A'reef was pretty hot -- at least, for a robot smuggler anyways; he had a big fluffy pink mohawk and a real hamster bone through his chin. They met in her fourth-year Post-Modern\u00b3 Post-Colonial Plutonian Lit class. He always hung out in the back of the class, and wore semi-invisible designer polo-shirts. He only lasted a few weeks into the semester before he got into robot smuggling in a big way. \"Open it!\"\n(Oh the joys esmail bring! Seasonal, celebratory, or otherwise! Nothing like it. It is so nice to hear from people, isn't it?)\n\"Whoa now, haven't run my anti-viral scans on the little bugger yet hang on --\"\n\"Override,\" Tammi said, without thinking, as she had done on many occasions prior.\n\"Whoop! Here it is!\" The computer displayed the contents of the email message:\nHeyy Tammi !@!!@!\nnbsp howw's itt goinngg ?? justt dringg inn wobbliee-bobbillees heree att thee pubsyy-wubbsyy andd ii wass thinkinn off uu !! kommee backeey soonn !!\nii gottaa shipp somee robotss!! laterr ,\nA'REEF-GOOMA-KOA\nRTFMxoxoxBRBxoLOLxoxoWTFxoxATM!\npss bookss aree forr looserrsss!\n\"Aw, that's so sweet,\" Tammi said. She felt her cheeks grow a bit hot. \"That was so thoughtful of A'reef. Hey computer, I think I'll write something back, alright?\"\nThe ship's cabin was silent.\n\"Computer?\"\n\"Gguh\u2014\" the computer began, \"ggguuuuhhhhhhh.\"\n\"Computer?\"\nHorrible noises came from the food-box. \"Gguuhhhh...\" the computer groaned.\nTammi bolted up. A little red light came on overhead. Tammi raced over to the observation console.\n\"I'm, I'm, sick --\" an awful burping noise came from the food-box, and suddenly, the little door of it flew open, and a strong gush of dark-green fluid splashed out of the box and onto the floor. \"Oh boy, I really don't feel so good.\" The computer's voice was now just barely personality-modulated: it sounded flat and tired. \"Zarbullabba-dabba-buh!\" Tammi swore. Tammi punched some buttons on the observation console. From here she could control the ship... if she could remember how. It seemed that there was some sort of computer virus attached to A'Reef's esmail, that much was apparent. Tammi punched a few keys, trying to get a sense of how bad the infection was. She requested a visual representation of the computer core. The computer core was a represented as a big, blue egg carton type thing, with wires running from it. It blinked red. Every other little section of the computer core had a big bold X through it.\nTammi started to feel a little anxious.\nThis wasn't good. All she wanted to do was pay off her English degree and now she was a year away from Mars with a computer core that was being eaten alive by some vicious badware. This wasn't good at all; this was actually really, really bad. Besides the low-level autonomic system, the bare essentials, the computer ran just about everything.\nAnd the virus was propagating faster than double-penised rabbits. More and more of the computer core was turning red on the visual display, memory bank after memory bank went offline. Only about a tenth of the memory banks staved off the infection, and were big-bold-X free.\nThe walls faded from sky-blue with pink polka dots to grimy gray.\nThe floor became quite cool.\nA closet opened, and her Porto-Gym 2500 LX fell to the floor, and broke. The quite background musak faded to white-noise'n'static. Tammi's pillow shriveled up, and turned into a little ball, the size of her fist.\nTammi cried.\nShe wished she was back home with A'reef-gooma-koa, enjoying his large kamda and giving him wet nucksters. And maybe doing some big globs of \u2018piff.\nYou know, it's not easy flying space ships around delivering woodchips. So you take the course right, and it's a quick course, you're in and out of there in like five weeks. They teach you all about relativity. They teach you all about conversation of energy. They teach you about cargo manifest forms. They teach you about Asimovian radiation.\nBut it ain't easy flying those space ships around.\nTammi found this out.\nShe tried to execute the emergency subroutine. The computer crashed and she had to do a reset.\nOnce the computer booted back up, she tried again. This time, she thought it was going to work. She double-tapped the EXECUTE button with her finger, and a new screen came up, and it said: ARE YOU SURE? (below, there were two buttons: YES and NO).\nTammi double-tapped YES.\nA screen came up, and said: ARE YOU SURE?\nTammi cried.\nThe lights were dimmer. The cabin was quieter. The food-box was hopeless. Anything she ordered came out looking like a hard, gray dill-pickle. This was bad, because before, everything had been gelatinous and cubed. Tammi was at the point yet were she was brave enough to eat the gray dill mystery pickle. She was getting to that point, however, and it scared her.\nThe cabin was cold. She'd exhale, and she'd see her breath. This was not good. Frost on the display screens, just like it use to accumulate on the windshield of her old flapper, back home. And it seemed to be getting colder. She now had on every single piece of clothing she had brought. She felt like an Eskimo in one of those movies about the old people that don't exist anymore.\nThe esmail virus\/badware had totally crippled the computer. The colors on the displays got all screwed up. Now, there was only cyan and magenta. The console wasn't even capable of flashing red anymore. The audio link was pretty gibbered as well. If Tammi gave any queries, the computer was no help. The computer would only respond with rhetorical questions, on unrelated subjects.\n\"Cc-cc-ccomputer,\" Tammi said, shivering. \"Hhow-hhow is the anti-ti-virus run-running?\"\nThere was a clunking sound. \"Oh Tammi...Tammi...How would you like it if Johnny stole your saxophone?\"\nTammi was on her cold bed when she heard the voice.\n\"Hey, hey,\" the voice said.\nIt didn't sound like the computer. The voice was hoarse, and deep.\nShe peeped her head out from beneath the covers.\n\"Yeah -- you there,\" the voice said.\n\"Who are you?\" There was a blurry projection in her pantry. It was a big amoeba. It wore a brown blazer. The amoeba had four long pseudopods which swung around not knocking over things, because they were holographic.\n\"I'm a computer virus,\" it said.\n\"Oh,\" Tammi said.\nThe amoeba floated over to Tammi's bed. Tammi wiggled deeper under the cold, unpowered bedcovers. The thing was huge. It blotted out the feeble overhead lights. One of the pseudopods reached into a pocket and pulled out a formula. The formula read: if g < z then p=(b(41)*y4(b+(k-6.423))) and goto subroutine5. The amoeba floated even closer. It waved the formula at Tammi. She cowered in her blankets.\n\"What's that?\" she said.\n\"Its code,\" said the virus.\n\"Oh?\"\n\"Yes.\" The pseudopods pushed the piece of code towards her, as if hoping she'd take it. \"Can you fix it? I think this piece is broken.\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Shucks,\" said the computer virus.\nThe amoeba floated back to the centre of the room. It began undergoing fission. Tammi stared. \"I'm self-propagating,\" the virus said. A big tear started up its middle. \"I wish my code wasn't broken.\" Protoplasm oozed out of its large tear. \"\u2014its tough being -- ugh!\"\nBy the time the amoeba was done splitting, Tammi thought she was going to pass out. It was pretty intense.\nThe new amoeba had a blue sports jacket, and only three pseudopods. It seemed friendly. When it was whole it floated over to Tammi's bed. The first amoeba started to fade away into a cloud of pink fuzz.\n\"What do you want?\" Tammi asked.\nThe amoeba turned upside down. Now Tammi could see it also wore a tie. The tie was striped. The amoeba shot a pseudopod at her. \"Have you ever thought of debt consolidation?\" it asked.\n\"No,\" Tammi said, in all honesty.\n\"Now's a good time!\" The amoeba sounded pretty happy. \"Sign these forms,\" the amoeba said, and pulled an envelope out of its sports jacket.\nTammi didn't sign the forms and the virus got angry. It floated over to the corner of the cabin, by the computer console. A dull red emanated from an organ suspended in the amoeba's chest. \"Well, no more food for you,\" it said.\nThe cabin was once again, silent, cold, and empty. Tammi got out of bed, with trepidation. She sighed. She didn't want to deal with talking projections anymore. The talking projections were bastards. All of them.\nAnd no sooner had she climbed out of bed, did a beam of light flit out of the holographic projector, and start writing a message:\nHI TAMI TUCKER!\nTHIS IS JOHN, YOUR AUTOMATED WALLMART INTERPLANETARY TECH SUPPORT FRIEND! I'LL BE HELPING YOU TODAY. FIRST OFF, YOU ARE IN NO DANGER! EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY. DON'T PANIC. YOUR SHIPMENT OF WOODCHIPS IS NOT AT RISK.\nTammi stared wide-eyed, incredulous! Deep-down forgotten harbored hopes that Wallmart Interplanetary had not abandoned her were brought out of the freezer; the hopes were then warmed, resuscitated, and embraced; hope was with her again: could the end be near? Tammi anxiously awaited the holographic projector's next message:\nOUR VIRUS SCANNERS HAVE DETECTED AN INFECTION IN YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM. YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM IS NO LONGER FUNCTIONING AS IT SHOULD. HOWEVER, WALLMART INTERPLANETARY IS HERE FOR YOU IN YOUR TIME OF NEED.\n\"Way to go,\" Tammi said. She picked up her skipping rope and started to skip. It took forever for the next screen of text to appear:\nYOUR SYSTEM IS INFECTED BY THE SO_NASTY-C VIRUS. IT IS CAPABLE OF ACHIEVING INTELLIGENCE AND MAY TRY TO EMPLOY THIS INTELLIGENCE TO YOUR DISADVANTAGE, OR, TO COERCE YOU TO EXPEDITE ITS REPRODUCTION. HOWEVER, ITS METHODS WILL BE NUGATORY.\nTammi stopped skipping. She stared at the message. \"Nugatory? Expedite its reproduction? What the hell does that mean? Nugatory!\" Tammi thought she may have heard that word before. She tried to think back to her English classes at the university. \"Nugatory?\"\nAnother bit of text came up:\nTHERE IS ONE WAY TO IMMEDIATLY CLEAR THE SYSTEM OF THE SO_NASTY-C BADWARE. IT IS VERY SIMPLE. THE VIRUS HAS A PROGRAMMING FLAW THAT YOU MUST EXPLOIT. IF THE EXPLOIT IS USED, THE VIRUS WILL DESTROY ITS ASTROMARG%IE EXCEPTION ERROR XE00064:::\nThere was no post-triple-colon text. The floating cursor blinked a slow, regular, sad pulse, overtop a blue screen, as if it felt abandoned, guideless, lost.\n\"Astromarg?\" Tammi skipped. \"What?\" The text was replaced by a new message:\nIN ORDER TO CLEAR THE SYSTEM VIRUS YOU MUST BUY DR.FOXXX'S TRIPLE-LENGTH IMPROVEMENT PACKAGE. IT IS THE ONLY ALL NATURAL ENCHANCEMENT PRODUCT ON THE MARKET THAT GUARANTEES TRIPLE-LENGTH RESULTS - OR IT'S FREE!!!\nTammi continued to skip. She figured if she stopped skipping, her whole little world would implode into the cold vacuum of space.\nThe virus returned. A little bit of the amoeba's cellular wall peeped out of the closet. It waggled a ski-gloved pseudopod at Tammi. \"So, Tammi,\" it began -- this time its voice was different: quicker, squeakier, more used-spaceship salesmanish -- \"what do you say? Buy Dr.Foxxx's Triple-Length package and not only will you get freedom, food, and guaranteed results, but if you order now, I'll also throw in this!\" The amoeba reached into the closet with a long, dangly pseudopod (that was almost three times as large as the others), and pulled out a length of pink rubber, then was contoured into the shape of a U. It had golden tassels at the ends, and blue lighting bolts on it.\nFood sounded good. \"What's that?\" Tammi said, still skipping.\n\"Introducing the Ab-ton-mizer! It's made out of galaxy-age Worko material, and is all the rage in the --\"\n\"Nope,\" Tammi said.\nThe amoeba came fully out of the closet. It drove the Ab-Ton-Mizer into a hollow cavity in its protoplasm, then, a moment later, launched it, with excessive force, from an orifice. It flew across the cabin and struck a pastoral painting. The virus lignified out of sheer disgust. \"Well!\" The virus squeaked: \"no more light for you then!\"\nThe cabin became dark.\nBut the cabin was not completely dark; the cabin wasn't black.\nIngenuity saved her; ingenuity was sparked by the darkness; from the spark came confidence; it all resulted in a little bit of light:\nIt was a little consolation for Tammi, and a small amount of light, in that the badware had little control over the bathroom OCCUPIED indicator, and a small amount of illumination shone forth -- getting the light to stay on (getting the bathroom perpetually OCCUPIED) was a bit of challenge, but a nail-file and a fear of death by accidental impalement goes a long way in a non-optimal situation; Tammi jimmied the door-close sensor, and now her cabin was bathed in a dark blue iridescence, and Tammi was a little mollified, for a small amount of time, before it sunk in to her how actually horrible and actually awful her entire situation was.\nWould she have to buy Dr. Foxxx's enlargement pills? Ab-ton-mizers? And if she bought both, would the badware leave? Or would another generation of amoeba just generate another polyester sports coat and pick up were there parent left off, as proper progeny should...? So many questions. So many unknowns. Perhaps there was another alternative?\n\"Hey, hey you,\" said something squirming in the dark corner of the cabin.\n\"Uh, yeah?\" Tammi said.\n\"Earn a university degree in two weeks. Obtain a prosperous future, money-earning power, and the prestige that comes with the degree you have always dreamed of. Earn a bachelor's degree based on your present knowledge and life experience, with no money down. Call 1-206-984-0106 today.\"\nTammi couldn't make out the squirmy shape in the corner. \"But I already have a university degree,\" Tami said.\n\"Oh,\" the mystery voice said. \"A lot of good it has done you.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"I said,\" the virus said, \"a lot of good your university degree has done you!\"\nTammi told the virus to go fuck itself.\n\"Good idea,\" the virus said. \"Well, I'm ah, turning off the gravity; I hope that's okay.\" Everything in the cabin that wasn't secured started to float. Tammi hovered off the ground and wiggled around a bit. This was her first time in zero gravity and she didn't like it.\nNo virus-projections were around. Things floated all over the cabin, like Tammi. She began collecting the knick-knacks, and putting them in a plastic satchel. One of the knick-knacks, her intelligent toothbrush, tried to sell her weight loss pills.\nNo toothbrush previous to this moment in time and space had ever been so destroyed.\nIn fact, the toothbrush, no longer exists.\nNot even in stories.\nThere comes a point when things get worse, then worse, and you figure you should do something different and see if it anything changes. The cabin was dark, cold, and gravity-less, when Tammi reached this point; she was hungry; she hadn't had anything to eat in eighteen hours. And she was scared.\nRescue was unlikely. WallMart Interplanetary most certainly knew that something was seriously wrong aboard, but, there wasn't all that much they could feasibly do. Presumably, they had already tried to reinstall the shipboard software remotely -- and this had failed -- and Tammi was in deep space, still traveling fast enough to severely hamper chances of actual rescue. And she was far, far, far away from her ultimate destination.\nShe was in trouble.\nShe thought of what she could do.\nShe came up with nothing.\nShe decided the best course of action would be to find out more about her antagonist, and take it from there.\nThe dull blue cabin filled now with whorls of smoke. Jets and puffs of subtly shimmering dust came out of the ventilation ducts in the ceiling; the air became humid, and smelt like metal... like aluminum. It was although she was no longer aboard her spaceship at all. There was a fog, and it was cold, and it was dark -- she could have been in some cabin on some desolate part of a barely colonized planet -- she felt very alone. She felt very alone but had a cherished idea of hope that she may, somehow, overcome the situation, preserve and survive. She would eat lamb-cube again. Once again, she would master the ship. She'd figure out how this badware clicked, and she'd figure out how to kill it. \"Hello, virus?\" Tammi said.\nThere was no answer, and besides her small area by the blue bathroom light, the rest of the cabin was nebulous, obfuscated by the smoke.\n\"I want to talk to you,\" she said.\nNothing.\n\"I want to buy some stuff,\" she said.\nAnd out of the wall of cloud came a creature. It was different than any of the others. It was bigger, for starters. It was huge. It almost stretched from wall to wall. It was thinner then the others. The others appeared as a watery bag of bits, this one was flat; bulging spherical vacuoles were clustered around a black cavity that undulated. It sallied forth -- it was quick moving; it came out of the clouds, then jerked back in; visibility was limited, but Tammi could see that the thing was a beast. The thing carried a briefcase in one pseudopod and a paper cup of coffee in the other. The cup of coffee was about a foot long. \"Do you want to get rich, quick?\" The thing's voice was deep, slow, and gruff. It sounded a bit sick. The creature coughed a phlegmatic cough and its body shock and the noise was awful.\nHer life depended on this. \"I do,\" Tammi began, \"but first I want you to answer some questions.\"\n\"You want to get rich, quick?\" The creature shrunk into the clouds a little bit. A feature of the creature started to dully blink red, a slow pulsing. \"Good, good.\" The thing erupted into a stochastic series of the same modulated harsh cough.\n\"What's your name?\" Tammi said.\n\"419,\" the creature responded. \"Cash or credit?\"\nTammi swore. It was a waste of a question. \"But --\" she stopped herself. She didn't want to upset the creature. What would it take next? Besides, her money didn't have much use if she died on this stupid spaceship. \"Credit.\"\n\"Dee-ducted!\" The effect was immediate. The red blink in its chest became a red strobe that lit up the cabin. And it grew. Even larger; it began to fill out, meter by square meter; it expanded until it took up more than half of the cabin. Another organ popped into existence in its protoplasm, and its briefcase got larger, and its handle transformed to gold; the coffee however, shrunk, but changed from paper to glass, and gained whip cream, and caramel drizzle (Tammi crept over and stared at it; watched as it whorled and reanimated, and it looked more delicious now, it looked even more appealing, re-projected). \"Ahh,\" 419 said, \"that's great. I hope you get rich, quick.\" The creature wiggled around a host of pseudopods, and did not cough. \"Your G.R.Q Plus package will arrive in about three months, ship-time. Well, I think I'll turn the gravity on now.\" And with that, Tammi felt herself become heavy, and she dropped, and fell to the floor in a heap, and bashed her kneecap on the corner of her chair.\nEverywhere objects fell and clanged to the floor; here a digital book fell to the floor and smashed open, there a Porto-Gym 2500 fell and broke into further smaller pieces. Tammi smiled and rubbed her knee.\nThe cabin was a bit brighter now; the blue bathroom light and red organ light from the creature mixed in the cabin through the suffused smoke. It was progress. \"419, I want to ask you some more questions,\" she said.\n419 retreated. \"More questions? About me?\" Its voice was no longer coarse. \"Do you want to get richer, quicker?\" Its bulk shimmered.\n\"No,\" Tammi said.\n\"Then I can't answer any questions. You have to buy something to get something in return.\"\n\"Why?\" Tammi said.\nThe creature folded; brought its points together, centered its bulk. \"What are you, a socialist?\" the computer virus said.\n\"Just answer my fucking questions!\" And Tammi, suspended in the cabin, put her head in hands, and started to sob.\nBeside the bathroom door, overlain on top the billowing gas, four necklaces appeared. They looked cheap. \"How about you just buy one of these lovely necklaces, and I'll answer some more questions for you? They are made out of genuine topaz and high quality Dimonde.\"\nDropping her hands, and blinking wet tears out of her eyes, Tammi checked out the necklaces. They were pretty gaudy. \"How much?\" she managed to say. She eyed the creature and its pulsating organ-bits and its plethora of gurgling, snapping little bubbles of gas and wondered, if it were real, would she be able to hurt it?\n\"Only six easy payments of nine-hundred and eight-six dollars\u2014\"\n\"What!\"\n\"-comes with a money back guarantee.\"\nTammi added it up. \"That's ridiculous!\" Her face turned red. She grabbed her satchel of collected knick-knacks and hurled it at the beast. The satchel flew harmlessly through the projection. \"Do you know how much debt I have?\"\n\"Debt?\" the creature intoned, then coughed.\nThe creature vanished.\n\"Hey, hey,\" a voice said, deep within the smoke.\nIt didn't sound like the massive badware. The voice was hoarse, and deep.\nTami saw some motion in the clouds. She grabbed on to the bathroom door handle to stabilize herself, and tried to make out the shape coming towards her.\nIt was another amoeba, with for swinging pseudopods. It wore a brown blazer.\n\"You again,\" Tammi said.\nThe amoeba came up to her. It reached into a pocket in its blazer. The computer virus began to prod her with an envelope. \"Say,\" the virus said.\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"Have you ever thought of debt consolidation?\"\n\"Sometimes,\" Tammi sighed. Was this the end? In deep space, cold, hungry, delivering woodchips? Solicited by holographic amoeba? Killed by badware? What kind of real badware would do that? Kill someone, if they did not buy? Tammi looked around and saw nothing worth dying for. Her life, if it was going to end here, would be a life of strung together failures, a live of emptiness, of pointlessness, and stupidity; regret came up strong and choked her; she could not speak.\n\"Hey, um, could you take a look at this?\" The virus said. It put the envelope away, and from the same pocket, pulled out a formula. \"I think it's broken. It doesn't make any sense.\" The formula was about a foot long and was written in white text; it read: if g < z then p=(b(41)*y4(b+(k-6.423))) and goto subroutine5.\nThe glow from the formula lit up the cabin. She saw the far wall for the first time in a long time. \"Sure,\" Tammi said, \"for some food.\"\nThe virus squirmed. \"That's really swell of you.\" The virus snapped its pseudopod like a whip and the formula floated over towards Tammi.\nIt was a nightmare. The amoeba was sticking formula in her face, and she was never much in computer science at school. All she could think about was food and how bad everything was going. \"Whats gee?\"\n\"Gee...gee...well, that's like the client's overall consolidated debt.\"\n\"Okay, right.\" Tammi studied the formula for the first time. She was interested, despite herself. \"And pee?\"\n\"Pee...pee...that's a little tricky to explain,\" the amoeba searched some of its pockets, presumably looking for answers.\n\"Sum it up for me,\" Tammi said.\n\"Pee is sort of like... how much...well... it has to do with chaos theory, super-singularities, and my product development matrix.\"\n\"Oh,\" Tammi said.\n\"See, that's were the problem is, I think.\" The brown-blazered virus poked the formula with a digit. \"I think that 41 should be a 42,\" the badware tugged at its nucleus. \"Yeah, something is definitely funky there,\" it said.\nThis was going nowhere. \"Can't you figure it out? Why don't you change yourself?\"\nThe amoeba's cell wall firmed up. \"Change myself? I don't know the foundation of logic behind any of this! You made me -- so you fix me!\"\nTammi's eyebrow arched. She squinted. \"Me?\" She began to rub her hands together. The cabin seemed even cooler. She thought about trying the manual console again. The distress beacon might be back online, by some miracle. \"If I fix your code, can you turn on the heat for me?\"\n\"Sure,\" the virus said, and its cell wall loosened up a bit.\nTammi couldn't believe it. \"Good.\" She thought that she should not seem to anxious to \u2018fix' the virus's code. \"I just need to know what zee and k and subroutine five is, than I'm all set.\"\nThe amoeba started to spin. \"Thanks for fixing me. I'm really supposed to be better, you know,\" the amoeba said.\n\"I know.\"\n\"Those ones are a bit easier to explain. Variable zee is sort of like the, consulting fee interest accrued after twenty years on the debt consolidation program --\"\n\"Oh,\" Tammi said, and tried to wrap her head around it.\n\"-variable k is the spin of an electrically neutral lepton, and subroutine5 is my self-fission program.\" The amoeba turned upside down. \"At least, I think that's what it all means.\"\nTammi stared at the code.\n\"Hey, have you ever thought of debt consolidation? Pretty soon I gotta split.\"\nShe wished she had anything from a piece of chalk to a electric-pen to work out the formula with. \"Just hold on a second, I'm going to fix it...\" maybe if she added some numbers to throw off the p variable the virus wouldn't be able to propagate correctly.\n\"No, really, I have to go -- last chance for debt consolidation!\" the amoeba chimed.\n\"Okay, okay, consolidate my debt!\" Tammi said.\n\"Wow! That's great. Cash or credit!\" the amoeba opened up its jacket and pulled out a thick paper envelope. \"Just tap this and you'll be all set!\" The virus was excited.\n\"First, I figured out the problem with your code! The less-than sign should be a greater-than sign. That'll fix'ya up, virus!\" Tammi was holding herself so tightly than her nails began to dig into herself.\n\"Thanks! That's good to hear. Okay, done. Now, cash or credit?\"\n\"Credit, definitely, credit. Put it all on credit. I'll pay later.\" Tammi taped the envelope.\n\"Awesome! Okay, calculating,\" the amoeba pulled out an old fashioned calculator. \"Calculating,\" it continued.\nTammi held her breath.\n\"Okay, just trying to get a handle on all your debt here...\"\n\"Did you get all of my student loans?\"\nThe amoeba was furiously hitting buttons with a bevy of pseudopods. \"Yup. Pre, post, and during.\"\n\"Overdraft?\"\n\"Check.\"\n\"My SuperCard?\"\n\"Check.\"\n\"Flapper payments?\"\n\"Ah, I thought those were under your parent's name; okay, one moment. Check.\"\n\"What about my Susie-Sammy Card?\"\n\"Got it.\"\n\"My Frequent Travelers Discount Account?\"\n\"Oh, forgot that one. Hang on a second,\" Tammi could hardly make out the calculator-striking pseudopods. They were going so quick. \"Carry the five,\" it mumbled.\nThe amoeba started to bulge. Bubbles skirted throughout its body. The bit of the amoeba's nuclei that Tammi could see underneath the jacket, was growing red, and beating, like a heart. Squiggly little worm-like things coursed throughout the badware's being.\n\"Is...that...it?\" the virus said. It sounded exhausted.\nTammi started to sweat, although the cabin was no warmer. Did she have enough debt? Did she misunderstand the formula? Tammi took a catalogue of all her possessions. Did she have anything else outstanding?\nThen it came to her. At first, she wanted to slap herself for forgetting something like that. Maybe it was enough to save her. \"Virus,\" she said, pointing at her magazine rack, \"that digital book is on loan from a public library -- I'm sure there's late fees -- did you add those?\"\n\"Calculating,\" the amoeba said. A new pseudopod grew out of it and combined with the other three banging on the calculator, working out figures. \"Calculating projected interest accrued,\" the nucleus became brighter now, and began to pulse; it grew and expanded and strained against the cell wall, \"applying, applying,\" the virus said, its voice weak and haggard and strained, \"computing...applying constant of general relativity to interest payments --\"\nTammi was horrified. The amoeba's nucleus was beating like a heart. Beside the heart was a wide-open vacuole, and it now, began to expand furiously.\n\"Ugh!\" the amoeba said, and exploded.\nNo sooner had the bits of burst amoeba splattered against all surfaces of the cabin did that wonderful voice come back, that she missed so much: \"Tammi, Tammi? Can you hear me?\"\n\"Computer!\" Tammi screamed.\n\"Tammi, you saved me!\" The floor grew warm; jets of heat blew out of nozzles in the wall, and pushed away the thick clouds of gas. A light came on overhead, and it was white, not red, nor blue, and it was bright enough to illuminate the entire cabin. \"I thought I was a goner!\"\n\"I knew all that debt was worth something,\" Tammi said. The automated cleaning robot whirred to life and got to work. Within a minute, the only remaining trace of her entire ordeal was the bathroom light being on. \"Don't let me override you again computer, make me some lamb, fix my bed up, and get some pills ready because I'm passing out. Don't wake me up until we get to Wallmart 6.\"\nnbsp \"Done; done; done; done; but what about the sixty day maintenance checks?\" the computer said.\nUninterrupted sleep was tempting, but saying the cursed \u2018o' word was not -- she'd never say that word again; never again; never ever. And she'd have to learn to live with it all, and deal with it, because she had many, many, many more trips ahead of her, and many more years of space travel -- that is, if she ever wanted to pay off all those lovely debts of hers, anyways.","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}

S.\nCliff was\n\"late\" because he had been jerking off, which is an irony\n(and a debilitating one) too obnoxious to consider now. It was nighttime:\nblessed nighttime. He was never in the mood for histrionics (especially\nnot now), so he didn't think about anything auxiliary tucked\naway in his brain; he just stood up against the brick wall, tapping\nhis foot rapidly. Nervously.\n\"Okay Okay Okay Okay!\"\nIt was nighttime, the time to feel good, the sidewalk marinating in the forced effervescence of drowning lights and flashy spectacle. This wasn't even the best part of the city, but the lights and the razzle-dazzle cascaded off any reflective surface too stubborn to get out of the way, making all the exterior walls lambent screens for enticing projections.\nFortunately, there were alcoves.\nYoung twenty-something's walked down this route to get to the clubs and bars. One such beauty walked past a Victoria Secret's ad, whose model was beautiful but ultimately dead, like a pinned butterfly. The dead-eyed, digitally altered advertisement -- promoting flesh sultry as burnished copper -- was eclipsed by the wholesome, frustrating presence of the sweet-souled genuine article walking down the sidewalk. She looked like such a nice person, strolling about with four friends in tow. She probably was such a nice person, and even if she wasn't, we have a way of excusing and altering the behavior of the wholesomely pretty, a genetic urge to render our most prized and strongest material above the rest of our common rabble.\nIt would just take a little more time, he was sure of it. Someone would stroll down, someone would stroll down the street, alone, hailing a taxi, walking to the Metro, slinking away from an unwanted advance at some twenty-something bar, her face a vision of twittering teasing, the way all pretty twenty-something girls get when there festively drunk, the way any kind and warm advance is responded with a hazy-eyed \"oh yeah?\"\nHe saw someone like him, he could tell, someone slinky with a motor in his foot keeping time on the wall. He couldn't believe it to be true, he probably saw himself in every guy he met. Fuck it, he should stroll down deeper -- its darker there.\n-Earlier-\nHe flipped through the pictures of the girls. Not women: girls. They looked like girls to him: seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, a little older. Its hard to look at them: they seemed like works of art already. But they can't look like anyone of them -- the results might be real embarrassing.\nIt was a rare moment of inactivity in the office. The diagnostics had all gone well and everything had gone off without a hitch, but of course, they opened to no fanfare, no acknowledgement, nothing, just to wait and see how the world reacts to their newest Rorschach test, how some will see security (most, thankfully) and a few others will get a little bit queasy. But they get sick about the specifics, not the intention.\nNever about the intention. Not now.\nEveryone acknowledges this work is needed.\nEven the addicts: the one's up too late, the ones who ignore their families, the ones who try and explain away those massive credit card debts (\"Honey, what's WPI Friends?\"). Everyone who dabbles -- and really, that's everyone -- feel a little bit like an addict.\nIt seemed so silly that it had to come to this. He still never bought into the idea of \"addicts.\" But other people did; it's a way to categorize, and a way to get funding. It's a way to get support.\nAnd people hate these addicts. They hate them because they see part of themselves.\nThe beautiful girls come scrolling in. Six of them. All between eighteen and twenty-three.\nHe politely extended his hand to all of them. \"I'm Dr. Mooney. It's nice to meet you all.\"\nThey responded in kind.\n\"It's...\" began one achingly radiant pixie-haired brunette, \"been surreal, for one thing.\" She smiled moonbeams, her flush skin delicate with pink hue. \"It's just amazing how this all works.\"\n\"Yes, we can all agree, it's something alright. Any questions?\"\nA demure, feather-tipped Japanese with platinum blonde streaks:\n\"When do we get our stipend?\"\nA quick, jocund huff. \"What stipend?\"\nLaughter.\nThe effects of wholesomely beautiful girls enjoying themselves is beyond contagious: it doesn't spread, it controls.\nSmiles all around.\n\"Soon.. But if that is the most pressing question on your mind, then things must be going well.\"\nThe Japanese girl smiled. Her eyes widened and the room seemed to light up. Mooney felt a soft, persistent hum of intelligence in the girl's face, her eyes, her laugh -- just felt it -- and just felt so happy she had agreed and that this girl was part of the project.\n\"I know, just speaking for myself,\" the pixie went, \"I feel this has just been a great experience. Just, all of this, knowing what this is for, and just being able to be a part of it.\" Everyone concurred.\n\"From the bottom of my heart, the thanks is all on the...paid side of the office.\"\nLaughter.\nAssociates were spinning around in their chair, not looking directly at any of the girls, just big grins, maybe hoping one of the girls would turn around and reveal a flit of interest, a wayward, attention-demanding flick of the eye, and at that moment his associates could feel as if they were on the same level with these beauties, deriving joy from the same experience, and that associate could think \"maybe she's interested in me.\"\nIt reminded Dr. Mooney of the early experiments: foregone conclusions really.\nItems are placed on sale in a supermarket. Two fat girls bring the items to the register, but the sales don't ring up. The cashier needs to call management. The items are trivial, like gum. Lines form as the girls hold up the line getting the manager. Gauge the line's reactions, their perception of the two fat girls, how quickly they become intemperate.\nDuplicate for pretty girls.\nGuess the results.\n-Now-\nThese girls, they walk out to the bar, in the bitter cold, in glorified bras and mini-skirts, low-rider jeans and various textures violently form-fitted to be as streamlined as a porpoise. The bar opens up -- the two second feedback of amplified screams and hoots and excitement -- and then the girls disappear.\nBut here is one girl is walking back. Alone.\nAlone. This girl is walking back alone.\nHe hated them. He was a nice guy, and he would look into beautiful faces and warm, open eyes and imagine some humanity in them, pretend that function met form. He believed that they would understand him, that all his life he just needed a beautiful girl to love him.\nBut they just give him that look. Flocked with their friends on all sides, how transparently disinterested they look, how obnoxiously hypocritically, overhearing them calls guys pigs and pricks and \"all the same\" and \"only after one thing\" when they were the ones after one thing, after a guy with money and looks and everything unnecessary.\nThey put their pictures on their websites, their Facebooks and their MySpaces -- coy pictures overflowing with exposed flesh and demure smiles and overt celebration -- and as you keep their sites open you cycle through static porn pictures, notice how their smiling faces aren't so far removed from the come-hither gaze of a porno slut, realize that its not a far stretch to picture these Facebook whores as real whores; you transpose faces, match foreign breasts to a familiar face, pick which bitch from high school should be matched up with the dehumanized pussy of some slut you will never know.\nThis girl was alone. This girl was an ignorance-feigning slut. Look at the way she's dressed.\nIf he was more attractive and richer, this would be the opening of every recent porn:\n\"Hey,\" he would say. \"where you goin', the night's young.\"\n\"Hey... home,\"\nshe would say, all glazy-eyed.\nHe wasn't actually sure how they all went down: he only needed to watch the online trailers to finish off. But probably money would be offered, the girl would be attracted by both cash and attention, and the fucking would commence, maybe in some back alley.\nHe realized he was following her into some back alley. This dumb bitch was doing the job for him.\nIn any other circumstance she would be making fun of him, she would be ignoring him, she would be embarrassing him, she would be a living testament to masculine frustration:\nBut not now.\nThe crew had spread around the lab, doing their own work. Mooney had headed downstairs, caught Morgan Flim going back into the raise room, schematics and notebook in hand. It was his lucky time of the month alright.\nEach month one of them got to go into the appropriately named \"raise room.\" Scope out the newest pornography -- \"new\" being a relative term, since pornography had a rate of production rivaling Happy Meals -- and do research on the newest angles, the newest themes, (on the street, amateur, professional, aggressive, low-fi, gentlemanly), the newest target (Asian girls, bbw, blondes, petite, teen, incest, diamond, hooters, older, geriatric, pedophilic), everything and anything to get a better handle on the streets.\n\"Lucky\" time of the month was a euphemism. A barrage, a never-ending masochist viewing session of all the newest, updated-to-the-day porn had a deadening effect on even the most eager new employee who was prematurely excited to tell his friends what he got paid to do all day.\nHe often joked that you could get all \"addicts\" to quit just by making them watch all of it: addicts live off the needling desire to view porn at any time, but porn at all times would be, well, kind of like sleeping with your wife day-in-and-day-out -- the repetition and boredom from which they were probably escaping. But, maybe not, as the kaleidoscope of different porn options made sure no consumer was left unsatisfied; the fact that a subject as simple as \"college whores\" could be so variegated left little doubt as to the depth of the modern porn well.\nSure, almost everyone wanted less porn, more real intimacy, more stable families, less \"addiction,\" whatever that meant. Porn (which we can identify but not define) was a strong bacteria that once targeted, mutated and flourished. Obscenity? Devoid of substantive content? It's amazing how quickly established pornographies would begin with a reading from the Bill of Rights, offer strained political metaphors (Lady Liberty eating out Blind Justice?) or admittedly cute political satire (they had lost count of how many pornos featured busty conservative lawyers being fucked -- literally and metaphorically -- by a defendant, or how many gay pornos featured surprisingly accurate portrayals of the president of Focus on the Family learning to tolerate and become less (or more) anal.)\nWell, poor old Flim was in the raise room, and Mooney was getting some schematics when he saw the feather-tipped Japanese girl across his desk, face pallid, worthless as a dead battery. The desk's contact with her swell breasts arched her ass toward Mooney.\nHe stood, dumbfounded. Was she okay? He felt his pulse quicken. He stared at the form on his desk. He couldn't help feeling guilty at indulging in her immaculate body. Her picturesque form, rendered immobile for optimal viewing, seemed almost aesthetically justified.\nShe seemed\nokay before.... He wondered, was she ill? A drunk?\nLike an answering machine whirring after the power comes back on, she bolted up to her feet.\n\"I... I...Oh\nmy god, I am sorry.... I, I don't know....\"\n\"It's okay,\" he said.\nOh my god.\n\"Oh my god,\" Mooney said aloud, the thought demanding vocalization.\nHe wondered how his staff had prepared her, made sure she was unconscious and prostrate. He could picture his staffer Morgan Flim popping out her tits while she was knocked out, just to see if she were truly unconscious. He could picture what Flim would say, \"It's not like she feels it or anything,\" or \"Hey, I'm just preparing her for her future!\" Mooney felt disgusted at Flim, regardless of whether Flim actually did anything like that; just knowing that Flim would do something like that was bad enough. Worse he felt disgusted at himself for not imagining some general idea of sexual molestation. Repugnance toward the idea of Flim popping her tit out was bad enough, but he had to wonder, the image necessitated imagining what her tit must look like, and that could just be revealing his own...\nFuck.\nHe saw the note next to where she had lain.\nIn big bold\nletters, he could see:\n\"Impressed\nyet?\"\nStupid question. Of course he was.\nWhat boasts from lab would be contained in that letter.\nWhat boasts fucking deserve to be in that letter.\nGoddamn, they were good, he told himself, goddamn we were good, he told himself, to make his insides stop foaming.\n-Now-\nHe wrapped his hand around her neck. They were in an alleyway, alone. How often does this happen! Never, it was unbelievable. He knew he would type this story online, post it in one of his preferred chat rooms, and they would never believe him. This was truly a story in the making: he remembered to note the yasp sound she made as the air left her throat.\n\"No,\" her voice abrupt and jagged as chipping ice.\n\"Yes,\" he said. His left hand circled around her waist like a seat belt, his inner arm feeling the comforting, demanding warmness of her cleavage. His right hand started the downward pull on her shirt. He could imagine how her tits would look popping out, the care-free caress of gravity making them perk and bounce ever so seductively, like a girl flashing, the drunken, weary shock on this girl's face like the effect from a camera. He almost wished some errant security camera was catching all this, just to see if his mental recording matched the voyeuristic, authoritative gaze of a true-to-life recording.\nHe eventually forced her down, her still saying \"no\" and \"please\" and \"someone help me,\" pushing him back, futilely pushing against his shoulders. She was drunk -- the slut -- and the alcohol -- the slut -- seemed to sedate her. A little disappointing.\nShe knew it wasn't just a grope after he started ripping off her pants. The tits -- full, firm, frustrating -- are the most scenic, the most fulfilling, but he needed to be inside her. Pussies were not as fun as the breasts -- the wet disgusting sloppy cave; he had once looked at one online spread completely open with medical tongs, and it had made him sick -- but they were necessary for complete satisfaction.\nPushing on her throat, he heard the crack! of her head against the brick wall. He noted the almost romantic way her dying hand stroked his inner lower lip on its descent. He unpried her bare (slut), unguarded mess -- no frat boys and their bottle's tonight -- spread it with a V of his fingers, and, surprisingly soft, forced his way inside.\n\"No,\" she murmured.\nIt was so tight. So tight, so wet, it was a little area of perfection and protection, a little gift he needed to take, something perfect from something so horrid, wretched, and inscrutable.\nIt was so tight.\nSo tight.\nSo fucking tight.\nScreaming. He was screaming for dear life. Something was wrong.\n(Twenty minutes before Cliff's forced entry, someone else who frequented Cliff's preferred chat rooms -- known to his legion as \"PearlyWhite\" -- caught his own prey and was in the process of pounding away. PearlyWhite made sure to bleed his bitch -- the satisfying, vindicating taste of her own blood; a practice PearlyWhite could not foretell would became M.O. amongst his ilk. PearlyWhite had caught himself a real live one).\nCliff knew it was too tight.\nIt was so fucking tight.\nFuck.\nFuck.\nFuck.\nCliff's mind was exploding. He was stuck.\nIt was shrinking.\nHer hole was literally shrinking around his penis. She couldn't just let him have this. She had to take away the prize.\n(and his friend with the internet handle PearlyWhite would flee after he was done, leaving his prey crumpled and worn like a cum-soaked blanket, and she would cry and wish for another life.\nElsewhere, another boy with an internet handle unbeknownst to PearlyWhite or Cliff was preparing to go out hunting, but a message in his cell phone from \"Flashfest\" offered a free trailer for \"Tricked College Tricks,\" and as he watched the four minute trailer, perused their offerings, loved the derring-do, come-hithering, put-ons and ultimate domination of these college bitches, he decided, fuck it, I'll stay in.)\nBut Cliff was stuck.\nHer wetness was like glue, thick and burning, like the times he masturbated with soap in the shower.\n\"FUCKING HELP ME!\" he screamed.\nAnd like a carnivorous flower she folded upon him.\nHe tried to tug, hard, and finding he couldn't, screamed to arise passions, awaken passersbys like no female scream could elicit in this alcohol-saturated downtown.\nLike a battery, the girl had gone out. Through mechanical reflex, her cervical muscles clamped down and tucked inwardly, her dying brain transmitted an electronic S.O.S to nearby police units.\nA cop received it on his LCD device.\nDowntown. Fortieth and Q, the message instructed.\nIf Cliff was learned in the sciences, he might have noticed how all the blood from his penis watered down the vaginal glue -- but he knew nothing and screamed.\n\"Tell me your name.\"\n\"Eliza Morton.\"\n\"Eliza, that's\na pretty name....\"\n\"Ha, thanks. I notice you didn't say anything about Morton.\"\nDr. Mooney smiled.\n\"I guess you just gotta keep it real,\" Eliza smiled.\n\"But Eliza,\nis that... ethnic? Is that, say, taken from a family member?\"\n\"Gloria. That's a nice name. I figure that's a name that cheers people up. You know, like 'glorious?'\"\nGloria smiled. She was authentically pretty, tan, bronze skin -- half African\/Vietnamese, an alluring mix -- but it was her smile that convinced Mooney she deserved to be in the program.\n\"Why thank you. Mooney is a nice name too. Astral. I am sure it makes people think of the solar system and space and what-not. That's pretty nice too.\"\nShe smiled again. He was pretty sure she was playing coy, low-key smart.\n\"No, Eliza came outta nowhere. No one I know of has this name. I like it though, boys seem to like it, girls seem to like it, it's all good.\"\nMooney smiled again.\n\"So what\nbrings you here, Ms. Morton?\"\nMs. Morton upper and lower lip tucked together: a sign of slight but noticeable cognitive stress, a sign of remembrance.\n\"I remember filling that out on the form.\"\n\"Yes, I know, please, indulge me -- in your own words.\"\n\"Well, it's a good cause. It's horrible what's going on out there. My friends and I don't feel safe. All of these people should be brought to justice, should be punished, and if this is the least I can do...\"\n\"Yes. I am glad you feel that way.\"\nShe smiled inwardly. \"Plus, in some ways, it is kind of flattering.\"\nTruth be told, this was the first time he ever heard that, and he was surprised, both at himself for not remembering if anyone had ever said that before and equally surprised at such a simple, unlooked equation: Flattery + Justice, private compliment and public benefit, a simple satisfactory sum. It was the perfect ego pleaser.\n\"Well, I do appreciate your honesty. Some might not view it that way. I do not want to dissuade you, but some might view it, as, well....\"\n\"Creepy?\" Gloria guessed.\n\"Ha, I guess it's not that hard to jump to the conclusion. Yes, I told her some people thought it was creepy, but Eliza, thankfully, thought otherwise. Some people have problems with it. I try and be sensitive to people's misgivings, and I try and explain -- fully -- what they are getting involved with.\"\n\"I can see why it's flattering, to be honest. Even though, if I am correct, it is all composite, still, a part of you is represented, is used to achieve the final product. And it feels good, to know, we -- we are making the streets safer. I have the utmost respect for you, sir. To be honest, I plan on going into law, and I am realistic enough to know that I probably won't be able to go into prosecution or public law -- I know I am still a romantic utopian at heart -- but part of this makes me feel better about myself. I -- well, part of me, whatever part -- can help get something done, help take these people off the street.\n\"And,\"\na smile returned, \"you are sort of immortalized forever. And, well,\nstanding in the waiting room with all those beautiful model girls,\nit makes you feel nice just to be a part of it. I mean, these girls...\nthese girls are so beautiful. Heh, promise me you'll let me see\nthe final product. Damn, with all these girls being used to make\nthat you'll need to keep me away!\"\nHe made a mental note of how ironic her societally-sanctioned bisexual quips are, but smiled anyways, because all these girls are usually pretty humble.\n\"I have two more questions for your, Eliza.\"\n\"I have two more questions for you, Gloria.\"\n\"And one request.\"\n\"And one request.\"\n\"Yes sir?\" Eliza had responded.\n\"Yes?\" Gloria had responded, in the same interview an hour after Eliza.\n\"Are you claustrophobic ? What do you think of when I mention dark rooms -- dark like midnight?\"\n\"Nothing,\" Eliza had said. \"I mean, I would hate to be in one, but I'm not claustrophobic.\"\n\"Ummm,\" Gloria stammered, reaching for an answer. She was afraid a wrong answer could disqualify her. \"Nothing really. I'm not claustrophobic or anything. I don't really like the dark, but probably no more any more than anyone else.\"\n\"One more question. In one short, terse, to-the-point sentence: What is your absolute worst memory?\"\nHe looked, hoping they knew what \"terse\" meant, wanting to see if their brows creased, if they were taken slightly aback at the get-in-and-get-out approach of revealing their most intimate and painful experience.\nEliza: \"I was in a car crash when I was young. My brother was driving and he was killed.\"\nGloria: \"My sister telling me that she was date-raped.\"\nAt one time, he remembered, a month ago, one of the girls he was interviewing for the program had asked him a question he was surprised wasn't asked more:\n\"What if they get someone whose innocent?\"\n\"None of them are innocent\" he had said.\nBefore she could ask the inevitable and obvious follow-up, he explained:\n\"They never say 'yes.'\"\nThis point always demanded more elaboration. Early in-house testing of the original female archetypes was too good at picking out fakes; the algorithmic response unit given to the \"girls\" could always be boiled down to a reductive pattern. There are incalculable variations on the whole \"saying no\" when confronted by a violent rapist, but the nature of mechanical reaction gave the early archetypes a detectable, rhythmic cadence to their voice. Attack; internal calculation; response. Of course, these rapists wouldn't be kidnapping these girls and interviewing them over tea and crumpets, so on the streets, in-and-out rapists would hardly be able to test the girl's response times and speech patterns (but never underestimate a fetish scorned: the staff soon envisioned rapists kidnapping girls and subjecting them to oral tests before determining whether they were \"real\").\nThese bugs had all been ironed out. Before these \"girls\" were just the equivalent of an obstinate machine -- a machine set to \"frustrate\" -- but new methods in A.I allowed these girls to deduce for themselves (not that it's a hard deduction) to resist violation.\nBut still, a girl like this could not be \"charmed\" or \"tricked\" in agreeing (never underestimate a fetish scorned; he could imagine rapists setting up impromptu \"reeducation camps\"). These \"girls\" had their own, independent response mechanisms -- as all people do -- but they're like rats in a maze who can pick only their own route.\nNever underestimate a fetish scorned: Mooney predicted rapists would soon be bleeding women on the street, to see if their blood tasted real enough.\n\"One more request, if you will indulge me?\"\nThey would always tighten up right here. Everyone knew they were scheduled for an hour, and since the interview had only taken twenty minutes up to this point, they would sit here wondering how this request was going to take the rest of the time.\n\"Can you please take this test?\" It tests reading comprehension, analytic and logical reasoning. It helps us immeasurably.\n\"I greatly appreciate the time, commitment, and unquantifiable service to the community you are offering us. I assure you, there will be many women -- and their families and friends -- who will not be able to thank you enough.\"\nThey had both gone in to take the test. The staff's skills had stumped him. Next to \"Eliza\" and next to \"Gloria\" and next to almost all the girls, the little box laid empty, indifferent. His inability to check that box signaled his transportation into a Dickian unreality,\nThe little box read: \"Real?\"\nHe could no longer tell. Just like that Japanese girl slumped on his desk, a saboteur his staff had mixed in with the real girls, just to drive the point home. The point: we're good.\nOr maybe, \"we deserve a raise.\"\nOne of these girls was real, the other one wasn't, and he couldn't tell.\nReal? A new \"girl\" laid out before him, brought to his attention while the crew hovered about, riddled with nervous excitement worthy of an angry bee's nest trapped in an overturned jelly jar.\nThis \"girl\" had caught a perp last night, although more like the perp had caught her.\nHer name was \"Theresa.\"\nEveryone was watching with rapt attention.\nThere seemed to be no bruising anywhere easily accessible to the human eye. A nod of her neck revealed some evidence of bruising on the back of the head. But nothing terrible.\nThis was the innocuous little wonder, the first non-victim, the first catch. The perp, some nobody named Cliff Ordelling, was in custody, caught by the most satisfying trap ever invented. Mooney liked to think, like a panoply of fraternal twins, every willing participant who contributed to this alien, composite beauty -- the 23-year old South African bombshell studying physics at University, the 19-year old Irish, Chinese mix just graduating high school -- could revel in the glory of their first success. He wanted to call every fantastic girl who participated and gush all over them, invite them to dinner, thank them until his phone exploded from overuse.\nWhen he fully undressed Theresa, the extent of the damage could be seen. Her lower body had been treated, well, like those private sex dolls you can buy downtown. Quickly, he thought of Japan -- America could hardly keep up with Japan in terms of disgusting pornography, delinquent sex toys and exotic fetishes, yet still, you don't see rapists prowling the streets like you do in America. (Or maybe just not as many are reported). Mooney's mind shot off to a faraway study that he still believed in:\n\"But objectivity\nrequires that an additional question be asked: 'Does pornography\nuse and availability prevent or reduce sex crime?' Both questions\nlead to hypotheses that have, over prolonged periods, been tested\nin Denmark, Sweden, West Germany and now in Japan. Indeed it appears\nfrom our data from Japan, as it was evident to Kutchinsky (1994),\nfrom research in Europe, that a large increase in available sexually\nexplicit materials, over many years, has not been correlated with\nan increase in rape or other sexual crimes.\" He still believed that\nto be true.\nYet here he was, with this public\/private doll.\nHe wondered how a footmark could faintly be seen above her bladder, and wondered whether this model (at one staffer's suggestion) was made to fart during her attack: nothing brought out male fury -- and more criminal charges -- like a feminine transgression of the sexual order.\nPeople around him were holding hands, one had slight tears in her eyes, out of happiness or regret was currently immaterial because a minute later when one out-of-the loop staffer came in and told them the perp's name, people cheered. One name off the streets, one fucking rapist asshole off the streets.\nLater that day, the thank you letters would come streaming by the truckload. Every project manager on the website -- which, mind you, was password protected -- had a stuffed e-mail account filled with effluent praise.\nThe next day, after they repaired the damages, Mr. Mooney brought her back to life.\n\"Theresa? It is Theresa, correct?\"\nShe awoke from a light nap. \"Hello,\" she said chirpily, still on the gurney.\nMooney smiled.\n\"Hello. Are you alright?\"\n\"Sure.\"\nHe put her back to sleep.\nLater, she awoke again, walked around in jeans and a baggy flannel shirt, looking both attainable in her lil-ol-American girl garb and something remote and fantastic, like a coveted, warm prize. She smiled sheen.\n\"Do you feel alright?\"\n\"I feel fine. What's going on here?\"\n\"Do you know why you are here?\"\nHer lips pouted for a second, \"Nope.\"\n\"Do you remember\nanything from last night?\"\n\"Um, I remember\nwaking up in a white room... is everything okay?\"\n\"Everything is fine, Theresa. We are gonna go soon. You can go home. Before you go, what music would you like to here?\"\n\"Anything?\"\n\"Anything.\"\nShe thought\nfor a second, and said, \"It would be weird without the girls, but\nhow about Born in the USA?\"\n\"Sure.\"\nIt played through the room.\nShe was going home.\nLate at night she would emerge from an exclusive, dark crawl space tucked away in consenting bars and clubs to flood the market and walk the night anew. Every night she was born anew, eyes and mind perpetually fresh.\nJust like BaitCar, Cliff's video went online. A little camera embedded under Theresa's breast had fulfilled Cliff's aberrant wish. \"Street's Watch: Take Back the Night, Reclaim our Communities: if you rape, you pay the price.\" If even one of these perverts were deterred after seeing Cliff writhe, it would be cost-effective. Along time ago, one of the staffers thought that, perhaps, this would make a great database: track downloads on the site, get information on these potential perverts, if we bust one, cross-reference them through the site, track their IP address, use it to show premeditation, to show that they knew the consequences and still acted. Think, he had said, this could be a database for legions of potential perverts.\nThe plan didn't fly, for obvious reasons.\nAnd face\nit -- twenty thousand downloads a month can't all be from rapists.\n|\n|\n______\n|\n||\n|\n______","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}

A message from the brain reached the epididymis front: \u201cReproduction has been initiated. Prepare for ejaculation. This is not a drill. Repeat. This is not a drill.\u201d\nThe commander brought all 40 million sperm cells together. \u201cAlright recruits,\u201d the commander began, \u201cthis is the big one, what you\u2019ve all been assembled for. We will be traveling deep into enemy territory. The enemy will do all in its power to destroy you. Be prepared to be attacked by inflammation, antibody turrets, and white blood cells. None of us will ever make it back. Only one of you will achieve our goal: fertilization of the egg. Any questions?\u201d\nAn X sperm cell named X300 flung her tail up and asked, \u201cHow will we know the egg, sir?\u201d\nThe commander replied, \u201cAttempt fertilization procedure. If the cell does not comply or attempts to harm you, you have chosen poorly. Also, once one of you achieves fertilization, the egg will form an impenetrable outer layer. At that point, the mission ends. Any other questions before we head to the vas deferens?\u201d\nThe X and Y sperm cells looked around with resolute heads. Another message came from the Brain, \u201cArousal complete. Continuing with fertilization procedure. Prepare for ejaculation. Good luck.\u201d\nThe sperm moved up through the vas deferens and into the seminal vesicles. Nutrients and water mixed around them, nourishment for their journey into the Beyond.\nThen ejaculation occurred in a flash of rushing fluids. \u201cGo, go, go! Don\u2019t look back! Keep swimming!\u201d The commander barked at his raw recruits. The sperm exited the urethra in a vast cloud of confusion. Cries of \u201cwhich way?\u201d and \u201clookout for white blood cells!\u201d rang throughout the vagina. Many sperm were turned around, unaware of which way to go.\n\u201cNot that way, cadets!\u201d the commander shouted. From deep in enemy territory, vaginal fluids began to flow. \u201cThat\u2019s our ticket, cells! Upstream!\u201d\nSome of the sperm cells were confused. Upstream? The sperm began to swim toward the source of the fluids. They soon found that swimming upstream was easier than trying to follow the chaotic and misty seminal fluids.\n\u201cFollow the stream, it\u2019ll lead us through the cervix and on into the uterus. After that, you\u2019re on your own,\u201d the commander ordered.\nAs the sperm began to draw near the cervix, one sperm shouted, \u201cIncoming white blood cells at two o\u2019clock. That\u2019s bogeys at two! Everyone, evasive maneuvers!\u201d The defense cells of the enemy began to attack and consume the sperm cells from the walls of the vagina, and antibody turrets made sperm immobile. In seconds, thousands of sperm cells fell to the power of the enemy\u2019s defense grid. X300 shouted, \u201cCover me, I\u2019m headin\u2019 for the cervix!\u201d The faster sperm cell Y300 responded, \u201cRoger that, X300. Help is on the way. Hold tight, over.\u201d\nX300 began twirling,\nspeeding up, rocketing toward the cervix, white blood cells hot\nin pursuit. Antibody turrets began to unleash their volleys at her,\nbut Y300 distracted them by flying in front of their sensors, drawing\ntheir fire. The white blood cells had to split up, and Y300 began\nto make daring maneuvers, flying between two white blood cells at\nhigh speeds, prompting a collision that sent chunks of cell membrane\nexploding outward. \u201cYahoo! That\u2019s two down, 'bout 3\nmillion to go!\u201d\n\u201cCool your jets, Y300. We still got some heavy traffic on our flanks,\u201d said another Y sperm cell, Y603.\n\u201cThose bogeys can\u2019t slow us down,\u201d Y300 laughed, as he entered the cervix, alongside X300 and the commander.\n\u201cGood show, cadets. Got a little hung up back there, but we\u2019re still go for mission,\u201d the commander said. Several million sperm cells got through the white blood cell front and entered the uterus.\nOnce inside the uterus, the commander gave the order to spread out, and the other sperm cells complied. Soon, sperm cells were searching every nook and cranny, hoping to find the egg or another entrance to where the egg might be. X300 felt like she had been swimming for days. \u201cThis must be what a red blood cell feels like\u2026\u201d she muttered. She moved her tail slower now, no need to be too fast. The stream was gone. She only had leftover semen and uterine moisture to rely on. She\u2019d need to conserve her strength if she wanted to reach the egg.\nThen, from way up in front, X300 received a message from Y300: \u201cGot the egg in my sights. I\u2019m beginning my run.\u201d\nInvigorated, X300 decided she would speed up just a little. However, she found she could not go any faster. Something stronger than curiosity and bravery worked within her to coerce her into maintaining her speed.\nThe commander joined her side. \u201cYour instinct is kicking in. Don\u2019t try to fight it. Like it or not, you can\u2019t go any faster than you are right now.\u201d\nX300 exclaimed, \u201cHow did you know\u2014sir, how can we hope to reach the egg, now?\u201d\nThe commander laughed and nodded, replying, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We still have a chance. Besides, it doesn\u2019t matter who fertilizes the egg. Whoever gets there first and penetrates the egg will be the best of us. We still have a chance.\u201d\nSome of the sperm began to lose the flow of semen and died from lack of nourishment. Many of the weaker sperm cells slowed down until they finally stopped moving, unable to continue. The older sperm cells died as well, too tired and run down. Only fifty thousand sperm cells entered the fallopian tubes.\nY300 could see the massive egg cell in full view before him. \u201cThere she is,\u201d he reported back to the others, \u201cWe got echo-echo-golf-golf niner. Vector five-six-six. Bearing on three. I\u2019m heading in. Initiating penetration procedure.\u201d\nThe sperm cell headed straight for the enormous round egg. As he got closer, he realized he was going too fast. \u201cCurrent velocity too strong for penetration. Can\u2019t adjust speeds. Mayday! Mayday! Going down!\u201d he shouted before smashing his head against the thick hide of the egg cell, splitting into a thousand tiny chunks of protein and DNA.\nNews traveled down the sperm cell line that many sperm had died, smashing against the thick hide of the egg. Near the entrance of the fallopian tube, X300 did not want to believe the awful news, but she knew it was true. She followed the sperm cells in front, using dwindling semen and moisture from the fallopian tube to swim. She could see the egg in the distance. As she approached, she passed sperm that had been too weak to go on and numerous others with split and shattered heads. She shuddered at all the broken sperm bodies.\nWhen she came closer to the egg, several thousand sperm were approaching as well, from different angles. She could see the commander in the distance, leading three thousand sperm toward the egg. Then, X300 did something she had not thought possible. She sped up. X300 swam until she thought she would burst, racing against twenty thousand other sperm toward the egg. She reached first. \u201cTarget\u2019s in sight. Initiating penetration procedure,\u201d she reported. Her head began to drill into the egg cell\u2019s membrane. She realized then that the other, faster sperm had weakened the egg cell enough to enable X300 to penetrate the cell membrane.\nThen, X300\u2019s head entered the interior of the egg. \u201cPenetration complete. Releasing payload. X300 out.\u201d X300\u2019s head burst into a cloud of DNA and other fertilization chemicals. A voice boomed from the egg, \u201cFertilization complete. Zygote online.\u201d\n\u201cMission complete, cells. Nice job,\u201d the commander said, \u201cthose were some real textbook moves back there. But let\u2019s see if we can\u2019t try for twins. All cells, initiate penetration! Go! Go! Go!\u201d\n|\n|\n______\n|\n||\n|\n______","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}

Buzzing about the base of the shrine were the zealous worker bees of city, state and federal law enforcement. Heavy-jacketed security in various shades of black brandished rifles on every corner. Twitching visibly from the street were the antiaircraft guns mounted on every 50th floor of the more strategically situated skyscrapers.\nWhen Todd Wheeler surveyed the scene from the window of his 65th floor corner office, the traffic pattern resembled a querulous caterpillar frustrated in a laboratory maze. An impressive view, one he hoped soon to lose.\nCompanies in target-rich cities had begun installing their executives closer to the center of their HQs, leaving corner offices and their sheets of vulnerable windows to high-up-but-not-unexpendable employees. Todd enjoyed the view but wanted to be Unexpendable. By the time the market closed tomorrow perhaps he would.\nHis Jaguar had Code Blue clearance, which meant he could park under his building at 5 Freedom Tower. As the Jaguar was waved through tighter and tighter bands of security, he felt winnowed, progressively distanced from the inchoate world outside.\nHe got quickly in step with the rushing crowd, passing the memorial of the Wall Street wipeout, marking the day in 2011 when a Syrian with a swiped messenger bike ID planted an acetone bomb on the famous bronze bull, killing 45 -- eleven from his future company, Baselton & Broom. One of the horns had impaled in a nearby oak and had been installed at the trading floor entrance -- brokers rubbed it for luck before descending into the pits.\nHe made a point to pass the spot every day, though it meant crossing a street and killing a minute or two in the process. Too many Manhattanites hunched around like mice, he thought, internalizing the threats around them, trying to be small. You had to confront the fear, wrestle with it, feel your stomach sing with every lurch of the plane or heart-freezing trill of the evacuation alarm. He went skiing when socially crucial, but the thrills felt cheap, redundant. And if it all went up tomorrow, or any day in the 12 months going forward (a prospect B&B's number crunchers estimated at 2.8%), it was a risk premium he was willing to take.\nWas compelled to take.\nHe turned his lucky corner of Wall and Pearl St., lorded over by a chocolate-black man who bagged his hair in a puffy sack that made him look a bit like the Alien from the movie. There was about him an ineffable smell of the barnyard that was virtually pagan in the financial heart of the world. That was obvious even if one missed the real pagan details, like the string of small, pebbled amulets around his neck and the ceramic bowl, garlanded with horsehair, that served as a donation bucket. The man was an underground adherent of Santeria. Literally underground -- below the subways. Donations twice a week over two years had coaxed that information, and little else, out of him.\nTodd caught his eye and dropped a soft sawbuck in the bucket instead of the usual annoying golden dollars. The man nodded with the slightest possible trace of a smile, more a softening around the eyes than anything around the lips. Then the man did something strange: He spoke. \"Bless you tomorrow.\"\nTodd felt a tingle from the back of his neck down to his wallet, where it stopped dead.\nHe knew about the witching hour.\nTodd dropped another $5 in. \"Buy your tribe a chicken.\"\nThe look the man gave him in return put a chill in the August air.\nMaybe the alien's sect didn't engage in animal sacrifice. Or required a higher form. Or didn't like being patronized. Oh well. Whatever good luck gods were in the air, Todd wanted to be buffeted in them. Always good to hedge.\nTodd headed for the bank of elevators marked for floors 40 and above. B&B had gotten a sweet deal on space in the Freedom complex after the Wall Street wipeout.\nA heavily manicured hand blocked his striding chest. \"Sir, step over here, please.\"\nFuck.\nSome days security nabbed 1 in 20, then for reasons known only to them (or for no reason save unpredictability), they'd screw down to 1 in 5. The big blonde doxy he'd drawn for a checker still seemed halfway human, though slightly harried and in need of a smoke.\n\"Tough day at the office?\" he said, winking with his voice.\nHer initial smile revealed itself as perfunctory, rolling up like a tricky window shade toward the ceiling. \"Just open your coat, sir.\"\n32 hours, he thought, warming himself with thoughts of the woman hung upside down and flogged. \"S. Thompson, Security\" was just attractive enough to make it a somewhat pleasant angry fantasy and allowed him to pass the three minutes (far too long -- she really was new) she spent checking him on the portable scanner for powder; Anthrax; liquid explosive; elevated heart rate.\nHe took a breath. He could take being stopped. It wouldn't do to waste his natural luck on small things like avoiding a pat-down-by-proxy, would it? There was a war on. Twenty years and going. And tomorrow afternoon the deal would be closed and he could be at ease in his Battery Park condo, Kaydence beside him.\nOr rather, below him.\n19 Hours\n\"Wow. That's amazing.\"\n\"What?\" His eyes were shut and they weren't opening again without damn good reason. Mowing down a row of charts before a lunch appointment, he'd plugged in a bad standard deviation and eight minutes later, a Chinaman quant with the can-you-believe-it-name Wong Wei barged upstairs to rail him out as if he'd just dishonored the man's family. Maybe he had, technically.\nTodd had nodded apologetically, alternating between fantasies of the man being water tortured or skewered through the abdomen via the rectum. Or was that Japanese? Maybe the guy was Japanese. He'd tried to memorize the facial differences once but couldn't keep them straight.\nAfter the witching hour, no more. He'd soar up the B&B incentive chart and they'd have to get him a core office -- maybe not right away, but soon. No more smiling at mail boys. No more waiting in coffee queues. Most assuredly no ass-reamings from quantitative analysts.\nBut that was tomorrow afternoon. Three o'clock, to be exact. Now the Ambien was kicking in and he just wanted to sleep, but no: Kaydence thought watching PBS made her smart.\n\"You remember the tsunami?\" She was saying. \"They say not a single animal got killed by it. They knew it was coming and ran away. Look, Todd. No animals!\"\nWith effort he focused.\nArchived footage of drowned villagers in 84-inch high-density color (he needed 96). Somehow soothing, knowing that amid the web rumors of suitcase nukes, the blackberry rumblings of alienated teens carrying explosion packs into cafeterias, that even worse things had happened once to wretched saps long ago and far away. The latest rumor: Terrorists pouring strychnine into the city reservoirs. He'd call Gristedes and get champagne delivered tomorrow.\nHe closed his eyes again and slumped, trying to become one with his drool-inducingly soft Cuddle Ewe underquilt. \"I'm like that with stock offerings,\" he mumbled. \"I can tell the good ones from the bad ones.\"\n\"You can like, smell them? With your nose?\"\nShe wanted to know if he could smell an IPO like a pig could sniff out a truffle. Well, he had brought it up. He blamed the Ambien.\nThen she asked, \"Speaking of um, big deals, how's your problem?\"\nWithout opening his eyes again he could see her face -- ill-concealed disrespect mixed with amusement. He hated it when the stupid thought they were clever.\n\"Ask me tomorrow night. After the market close. I'll have good news then.\" He knew, bone-deep, his option play would pay off big time.\n\"You think you'll be cured by then, like magic?\"\nUnder the covers he clenched his fists. He really hated it when someone stupid thought they had something on him.\nWhile his fellow NYUers had dicked around in Russian literature and Renaissance art, Todd had gone full bore B-school. After graduation he'd spent his weekends staring at IPO prospectuses and earnings models while they swallowed oysters down the shore with real ones. Now he'd acquired a mind-bending glamazon, six-feet-one in stockings, a graceful burper. Not as bitchy as she could be, which would be the nicest thing he would ever think about her.\nAnd tomorrow he would seal the deal -- settle accounts with every liberal intolerant with cryptic tattoos who'd ever thought him shallow because he made a lot (a lot) of money. He was no uptight Republican, either. He totally supported abortion. Of course he did. He was dating a Guess model, for God's sake.\nTomorrow he'd take Kaydence out to Jamm's for the afro-fusion cuisine she pretended to like, let her gargle all the champagne she wanted, and whisk her back in the hired car for some honest-to-god fucking. Then, if the roads weren't jammed with security, maybe detour into the lower reaches of Battery Park for some pot, to loosen things up on the back end in case the cuddling and KY didn't suffice.\n8 Hours\nFriday morning.\nBriskly rounding the corner, wallet already out. Maybe a $20 today. A $50? No, too patronizing. You had to sidle up to luck, not let it know you --\nthe man wasn't there.\nRounded up by security? No -- he'd been grandfathered in. The authorities knew he disappeared down into the subway at night, and figured it helped to have eyes down there. Even alienated, kooky ones.\nHe looked up. The sky was a clear, cloudless blue.\nTerrorist-attack blue. The city, maybe the whole country, was under attack, or would be very soon. He knew it like he knew Nordscan would go belly-up and that his witching hour option play on Nitex would pay off big time.\nHe'd miss Baselton & Broom's chubby secretary with the porn-line phone voice. Anne's 50s-purple dress and ribbed stockings getup she naively thought suited her. The self-satisfied chart analysts that smelled of microwave popcorn and loamy leavings of furtive porn creamed into XXL silk underwear. He'd even miss Wong Wei and the other chinky quants. Soon all to be soot and skulls.\nCorrection: Would have paid off big time.\nAnd his lucky charm? Five minutes away, buried under blankets. Bless her, on her off days she didn't rise before 11. And his phone signal was clear, for now.\nOn the phone, he was very insistent.\nShe arrived by taxi outside 5 Freedom Way, looking like a whore-assassin from a graphic novel, red dress, black hose, tottering in 4-inch heels. Supernaturally hot. And no way she could run in those heels without rupturing a vessel. Even better.\n\"So where's this great brunch party?\" she sneered. \"I hardly had time to put makeup on.\"\n\"You look great.\" She always did. \"It's down here.\" Todd pointed to the stairs leading down to the A and C subway lines.\nThe incomprehension on Kaydence's face was followed, eventually, by disbelief. \"We're riding the subway?\"\n\"Not exactly. Come on.\"\nAfter avoiding random patdowns at the entrance (more luck) he took her hand and walked briskly toward the end of the platform.\n\"What kind of party is it?\"\n\"A rasta party. You know Santeria, the religion?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Well, it's very ethnic. Like chicken?\"\n\"I could eat chicken I guess. It doesn't break my diet. It's a little early. Is it baked or saut\u00e9ed?\"\n\"Not sure. Hop down.\" They got down on the tracks, passing the medicine-red \"Do Not Enter\" sign, to where the white-tiled tunnel walls gave way to a shell of oppressing gray concrete and the smell of rust and dirt and decay.\nIn the dim light the tunnel yawned toward the horizon in an endless series of corrugated iron rings embellished with graffiti, like a historical mural marking the failure of immigration laws. A row of rusty detritus separated the two tracks - usually the tunnels could accommodate four, but this line had been reinforced in the wake of the last attack. If he was at all susceptible to claustrophobia, this is where he'd start losing breath. Instead, he felt calmer.\nRumbling, then faint screaming emanated from the City Hall stop at the far end. He -- well, they -- had escaped the attack by, oh, seven minutes. Ahead the light seemed filtered, as if obscured by clouds, or choked with smoke. No rush of people coming down the tunnel, but there soon would be.\n\"I hear it's a great party,\" he said, keeping the banter light and his grip tight. \"Quite suave. Every Friday morning.\"\n\"Where'd you hear about it?\" Kaydence said, knowing he wasn't hip.\n\"There was a secret number to call for an invite. It's hidden in the SoDoku puzzle in the Observer.\"\n\"I thought you were too busy for that stuff.\" Kaydence sounded petulant. \"That's what you tell me when I call. Hey, is it really suave? Because it's really smelly down here.\" Strangely, she seemed mollified -- as if something this disgusting just had to mean authenticity awaited at the other end. \"No rats, at least.\"\nHe pondered. \"No, there aren't.\"\nAfter her heel snagged twice they skipped off the tracks and walked along side them, so that the \"mud\" swallowed half a shoe with every squelchy step. \"Ugh! I am so tossing these. What's all the noise?\"\nIt had only taken her two minutes to notice. \"Manhattan's under attack. Nukes, maybe. Everyone up there's dead or dying. But we'll be safe. As long as find the doorway down.\"\nShe shrieked once and then went silent, letting him drag her along.\nOnce his family had gone camping in the Berkshires. Snuggled in a strange, soft bed somewhere in the mountains, he'd read a picture book about Noah and the Great Flood as rain hammered on a tin roof.\nOn the way home, lying in the back seat and making out the constellations, he'd ended up in the middle of the road, staring up at a strange solemn woman beatified in a crossfire of headlights, a crucifix around her neck (was he in heaven?) with the mutilated car nearby, squeezed like an accordion, parents dripping red in the front seat.\nThe emergency had never passed.\n\"We'll be safe. We just need--\" Then he saw it -- a plain white utility door set into the gray wall. It was balky, but with a harder pull it creaked open, revealing a forbidding flight of rusty stairs that they softly descended, streaking their hands with rust.\n\"So there's no party?\"\nHe didn't deign to answer, just clutched her wrist tighter. Quiet as they'd been, they were surrounded by the time they touched bottom: Ten or twelve mole people, black as soot, with more filing into the vast, almost gallery-style space.\n\"Oh shit.\" Kaydence reached for her Virginia Slims. He slapped them out of her hand and into the muck.\n\"Not sure if it's cool here,\" he said.\nA noisy rivulet under his feet turned out to be a channel of dark thick sludge -- a shit-stream. Maybe a sewer line gone awry, more likely something jury-rigged by the moles to flow through their bleak Eden.\nA few tame dogs muddled around, and from somewhere came a cooking smell that didn't make Todd's stomach turn -- until he noticed a raccoon-sized rat roasting on a spit. Kaydence sniffed the air, as if still holding out hope for the chicken.\nHe dropped a quarter into the running dark murk and didn't hear it clink bottom. Deep enough.\nA figure emerged from a makeshift shack of jury-rigged oilcans insulated with rags and bits of old tire. He recognized the afro-mass of hair, a darker shadow transposed on top of the darkness of the man-made cavern.\nHis life was up for grabs. To preserve it he would put his soul in pawn to the madman in front of him, like the madmen now filing behind the madman had done. And if he had to go mad to prove himself, it was a price he would pay.\n\"No more animals to sacrifice,\" Todd said. \"No more pigeons. Not even rats. They all fled. Like after the tsunami.\"\n\"What is that to me?\"\n\"A million people are dead already. I can feel it. Can you?\"\n\"Yes. But again, why do you belong here? What do you bring, Mr. Suit? Besides your silk tie and your girlfriend and insulting offers to gods of chance you don't believe in.\"\n\"Most ties are silk ties, shaman. That's just a boring clich\u00e9. And I do believe. I can do anything that's required.\"\nThree years ago Todd had said much the same thing to B&B's headhunter, and when tasked had snagged the company's CEO four tickets to a sold-out performance of \"The Aristocrats.\"\nHe let go of Kaydence, whipping off his tie. \"All her life she's had everything her way. She models 8 hours a week and makes money she doesn't even need because I pay for everything.\"\nStill holding her hand, he twisted the wincing Kaydence around.\n\"But what does that do for us? We cannot use her.\"\n\"I think you can.\" Todd pulled her closer, binding her wrists with his tie.\n\"What the--\" Kaydence looked into Todd's eyes. For the first and last time she achieved some understanding of her boyfriend, and screamed.\nHe took her by the hair and dragged her down, ducking her head into the running stream of sludge and shit before she had a chance to say anything, if she'd ever had anything to say. Still, her surprisingly fierce shoulders bucked and strained for two full minutes, her frantic hair bobbing and spreading on the black waves of swift-running putridity, like a blonde slick. The shaman nodded, and his helpers dispersed. There was a clattering of chains and hacksaws being pulled from makeshift shelves.\nTodd's pants stirred. Yes. There it was. A stiff one. But too late. Too late for everyone. Everyone but him. He'd be alright. He'd offered the correct sacrifice, proven his worth.\nAfter the last twitch he dragged up the body, heavy after its drenching. The mouth and nostrils were caked up like filters, the empty glass cages of the eyes frozen with rabbit fear.\nTodd let her drop, lifting his arms heavenward but looking at the shaman.\n\"Save me,\" he cried.\n|\n|\n______\n|\n||\n|\n______","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}

It was\nhard to believe that it could mean something. Shirley wished for\nit to contain a gift. Perhaps, something special to compensate for\nthe shadow that she had to give up in order to get a room in the\nShelter.\nShe heard the gurgling of the giant mechanical worm outside the building. She tried to be afraid only to feel normal again, but she was too tired to even bother conjuring the right fear reflexes. There would be time for that later.\nShe glanced at the tongue-bed; it was damp and marred with pores from all the things it had lapped before. Although it looked safe because it was still asleep, its edges had ulcerations.\nEasing carefully on the tongue-bed so as not to wake it prematurely, Shirley puzzled over the tiny box she had found on the shed two world-hours ago. It had no visible flaps. It was nearly weightless and very hard, a hardness that was neither metallic nor organic. And so smooth. Perhaps, it was not meant to be opened like all the other boxes before it.\nThey will get you someday, her brother, Arthur, had said to her when she opened the doorway and never looked back. That was the time Shirley had lost her right hand; the doorway had to take something.\nThe last words she heard before she disappeared with her dreams of escape were the screams of her little sister, Mischa: \"Only five stitches, Shirley. Five stitches to close the mouth of the Apocalypse--\"\nShirley missed them both. If she knew how to pray, then she would pray for them not to \"go for it\" like she did. It was the same everywhere. The landscape in and out of the doorway was already tainted end to end. Only the sky was left intact. It was still blue with fluffs of very real-looking white clouds in certain areas. Her mother said that They had forgotten to change it. Did it matter -- what was left unchanged? Shirley did not think so; she only hoped that she could still find a way to warn her siblings.\nOutside, the giant mechanical worm was still making that peculiar sloshing sound. It was making its rounds for stray people, knowing that the carnivorous Shelter was impregnable and kept all its guests behind its membranous hinges.\nBehind the door, the clock was ticking. The walls had little human arms that waved to and fro in a motion that was both mesmerizing and annoying. There were no piles of bones on the floor, which was a good sign. The room was not hungry yet. There would be time for that later.\nShirley, after twenty-five years of running, found out that she no longer cared and went to sleep.\n|\n|\n______\n|\n||\n|\n______","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}

At the far end of the arena the Stars and Stripes took up most of the end wall, and an air conditioning unit caused it to billow patriotically.\nOn the main floor of the arena, the cowboys warmed up their horses with a quick canter around the track. Up in the stands were family and friends, waiting for their favorite to compete. You could hear the jangle of spurs as cowboys made their way to the restrooms or to the fudge counter. A cowboy needs his fudge.\nOutside in the big white tent, the little doggies were being prepped to enter the arena. Power packs were booted, software was checked and double-checked and a buffing crew made sure every doggie had a nice shine.\nThe playing of the national anthem was the signal for the techies to get the doggies inside and ready for the competition.\nWhile every cowboy inside stood at attention with his hand over his heart, a line of doggies made their way into the arena and into the holding pen.\nBright lights played across the sandy surface of the arena, and an expectant buzz ran through the crowd.\n\"Let's get this show on the road, folks. We've got semi-finalists from yesterday's competition. Cain't wait to see how it goes today, but first let's thank our sponsors: Ford, John Deere, Reliant BodyForms out of San Rafael, California, and, lastly, Chaps Beer, the cowboy's bestest friend in the West,\" the announcer said.\nThree cowboys on horseback formed a semi-circle facing the end door, while a spotlight played across it. When it finally swung open, out poured the doggies. And the crowd loved it. The 'little doggies' were in their quad mode, meaning they were now on all fours, had extended their necks, 'grown' tails and horns and had enlarged their nostrils. Their 'milling about' software kicked in, and you could even hear actual cattle bawling sounds.\nThe announcer read off the names of the first cutting team and a buzzer sounded to start the competition.\nOne cowboy urged his horse forward to 'cut' the first batch of doggies out. The crowd applauded as the doggies were cut down to one, and the others were allowed to rejoin the herd. The object at this point was to keep the lone doggie from doing the same.\n\"Folks, look at that horse work,\" called the announcer. \"It's pure team work. Man and beast.\"\nThe doggie burst left, trying to make an end run around the horse and rider, but the horse knew the game and moved instinctively to block. Even when the doggie feinted back and forth, the horse was there\u2014\u2014and the audience loved it. A good cutting horse had that gut sense. It was just a matter of letting it do its job.\nThe doggie turned, ran hard to the left and slid on all fours into the sand. It quickly got to its feet and headed in the opposite direction, only to be met by another cowboy. Finally, the time buzzer sounded and the doggie was allowed to return to the herd. The audience applauded the good work.\n\"That was some great cuttin' out there, and here comes our next team. By the way, folks, them doggies shouldn't feel bad, my wife cuts me off like that when I try to get another beer.\"\nThe competition continued with three more sets of riders in quick succession. Each managed to keep the doggie from slipping around them. Most of the doggies were now dirty from falling in the sand and horse poop.\nIn the midst of one event, a doggie fell in the sand, tried to get up but couldn't. One of the riders ambled over and signaled for a tech team. As the crowd watched, the doggie's left forelimb began flopping up and down, as if it was getting rapid and high jolts of electricity.\n\"Looks like we got us a live one. Anyone got a screwdriver?\"\nThe white clad tech team ran out, one of them carrying a silver briefcase. Now the doggie's right leg started kicking.\n\"If it gets that other leg goin', we can have a hoedown,\" said the announcer to laughter. Meanwhile the cutting cowboys sat on their horses and talked on their cell phones.\nTaking care to avoid the flailing limbs the lead tech guy flopped the doggie over on its back, flipped open a tiny door and pressed a button. Immediately, the doggie went still. The other techie opened the briefcase, ran a couple of wires to a port on the doggie's neck and flicked on a small video screen inside the case.\nIt didn't take two minutes for him to shake his head and signal for a couple of stretcher boys to come out.\n\"Looks like he's a goner! Well, they'll get him off the field, and we'll get back to business.\"\nThe techies straightened its legs and arms and helped set the robot on the stretcher. The non functioning doggie was carried out of the arena to much applause from the crowd.\nInside the tent were other bots from the previous day. Most required only that the software be reloaded while others would need extensive work and would be shipped back to the lab in California.\nThe competition continued until late the next afternoon when, for most of the cowboys and spectators, the real fun began.\nOfficially the final event was known as American Discovery, but everyone knew it as the 'turkey shoot.' This always drew a big crowd, and nearly all the cowboys signed up for it. Spectators were also allowed to participate.\nThe techies reprogrammed the doggies, and they went from quadruped cattle to bipedal Indians\u2014\u2014bad Indians. Two costumers dressed and put makeup on the bots, and each was armed with a rubber tomahawk and knife.\nWith the arena cleared, the doggies, now Indians, marched in single file back into the arena. In the center of the arena sat a wagon with actors playing a pioneer family.\nWith everyone in place, including the fire marshal in the stands, the lights went down and the announcer, over the sound of tom-toms said, \"The brave American pioneers who set off in wagon trains to civilize this great land faced many hardships: starvation, sickness, blizzards\u2014\u2014but their greatest hardship was an unseen enemy, an enemy determined to keep the land underdeveloped and un-Christian. This enemy was the savage Indian.\"\nUp came the lights and out came the Indians, with everyone booing. They ran in tight formation around the arena, waving their tomahawks and making pre-recorded war cries from their sound systems. The sound of drums grew louder. When the Indians reached the far end of the arena on their second lap, they stopped and one of them pointed to the wagon, which, up till this point, had been unlit. Now a spotlight hit it. The Indians charged, surrounding the wagon and attacking with their knives and tomahawks. The pioneer family retreated to the safety of the fudge exit, with the dad firing as he retreated.\nFollowing an electronic signal from one of the techies, the wagon burst into flame. The crowd loved it. A bugle sounded. From the opposite end the big gates swung open and in came the cavalry, dressed in blue, with Winchesters at the ready.\nTo avoid having cowboys shooting one another with real bullets, the weapon used was a smart gun, which did not fire an actual bullet, but when pointed at certain 'hotspots' on the Indian's body would signal a 'blood' capsule to burst, making it look as though the Indian had been shot. Some of the capsules were squirters, some were sprayers and some literally gushed the dark red fluid. If an Indian took more than four hits, it was programmed to 'die.'\n\"Wow, look at Don Kingman of Cheyenne, Wyoming, he just fired two perfectly placed rounds into that Injun\u2014\u2014and it's still standing.\"\nOne family from Las Cruces, New Mexico, stood high in the stands and fired en famille. Hits were celebrated by high fives.\n\"There's one trying to get over wall, boys. Don't let him git away!\"\nThe Indian got halfway over the wall before being felled by a volley of shots. Red fluid spurted into the sand.\n\"I think he's done sprung a leak!\"\nIn a touching scene one Indian stood in front of another one, taking enough shots in the chest to cause it to fall face forward in the sand. The other Indian ran but a nice shot to the head took its eye out.\n\"Can someone turn on the light, I cain't see a thing!\"\nThe one-eyed bot continued across the arena, but a kid from Tennessee, who hadn't hit a thing, finally put one right through the heart. An explosion of blood followed and the Indian sank to its knees.\n\"Nice shootin' from the stands. Let's give that youngster a round of applause!\"\nWhen the last Indian had been killed, the cavalry did one last ride around the arena to booming applause.\n\"Brangs tears to your eyes, doesn't it, folks?\"\nThat night the competition officially ended with a barbecue and dance, and not a bottle of Chaps was left standing.\nBy ten the next the morning everyone was on the road heading west to Montana. The bright light of morning dimmed as the hours passed, and soon they had driven right into a powerful thunderstorm which brought visibility down to a fudge length.\nNo one saw the twister drop from the clouds, bearing down on the convoy. It hit like a bomb, blowing every truck in its path off the road.\nIt caught the rig hauling the bots from the side, sucked out the driver and passenger, and whirled the trailer around like it was a panty on a fingertip. Out spilled the bots. Most were torn up immediately by the cyclonic winds, and some were flung far into the fields, losing body parts as they went.\nBut one of the bots hit the ground intact, causing its dormant power pack to boot. As the twister careened off into the distance, the bot came to full power. In a minute it had extended its neck, grew its horns and a tail and was standing in the quad mode.\nA familiar sound from behind caused the bot to turn its doggie head. Nearby stood a herd of Black Angus cattle. The bot returned the moo sounds, and walked over to the black herd. After some initial sniffing, cud chewing and green plops deposited, the herd accepted the new white angus and headed for the feed trough.\n|\n|\n______\n|\n||\n|\n______","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}

The rear door slid up and the Jonnie-Bot descended the ramp to the street. Two bio-degradable cellulose bags full of groceries were in the robot\u2019s rear tray. A loaf of bread balanced on top of the heavier items. The robot rolled to the side entrance of the house and stopped. Cameras mounted on its two eye-stalks swiveled back and forth.\nEach customer received a storage bin from the grocery store. The Jonnie-Bot could then deliver the goods and lock them in the bin against animals or theft. The robot circled the residence without finding the bin. It communicated with the van which checked the grocery store\u2019s database. The RFID tag for the bin was inactive, however the address was correct.\nThe robot separated its wheels for all terrain mode and ascended the stairs to the side door. It used the grappling arm to rap on the door and noted that a mark had been made on it. The new software program subtracted five points. The program was written to rate the actions the robot made and help it learn to make better strategic decisions.\nThe grappling arm knocked again, this time using less force. When the door opened the robot scanned the person and calculated, based on facial, arm, and leg hair, a 94% chance that the person was a male.\n\u201cWhat the hell are you?\u201d the man asked.\n\u201cGood morning, sir,\u201d the robot said through its speakers in a cheerful masculine voice. \u201cI am Jonnie-Bot, the versatile delivery droid. Please indicate the location in which to deposit your grocery order.\u201d\n\u201cGroceries? I didn\u2019t order any groceries. You got the wrong house.\u201d\n\u201cYour residence has been verified. Please indicate the location in which to deposit your grocery order.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026Didn\u2019t\u2026Order\u2026It,\u201d the man said. \u201cNow piss off!\u201d\nThe robot shot out its grappling arm to keep the door open.\n\u201cHey!\u201d\nThe door frame was slightly marked which would subtract another five points from the robot\u2019s rating. A failed delivery would subtract 50 points.\n\u201cI am capable of delivering indoors. My self-cleaning rubber wheels will not mar, scuff, or dirty any floor surface. Please indicate the location in which to deposit your grocery order.\u201d\n\u201cDeposit this!\u201d the man said, aiming a kick at the grappling arm.\nSensing danger, the robot retreated. Avoiding physical contact with animals and humans added three points. However, the door was now shut. The robot rapped again without result.\nThe delivery van transmitted an update. Successful deliveries were down 2% for the day. All Jonnie-Bots were instructed to develop any strategy that would improve the store\u2019s statistics.\nThere was a window next to the side door that appeared to be unlatched. Rolling into the bushes, the robot reached up with the grappling arm. The fingers dug into the soft wood (subtract 5 points) and the arm started to pull the robot up. The man, realizing what the robot was attempting to do, latched the window to secure it. He pointed to a cell phone in his hand.\n\u201cI\u2019m calling the cops!\u201d\n\u201cPolice involvement,\u201d the robot said, \u201cis only required in the event of dismemberment or death. Please indicate the location-\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m calling right now!\u201d\nThe robot released the sill and climbed the stairs again. The grappling arm deployed several thin metal tines which were inserted into the lock. After a few jiggling attempts the doorknob lock was sprung. The deadbolt lock would not turn.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not getting in!\u201d the man said.\nThe robot calculated the cost\/benefit ratio using the point system of the new software. Successful delivery was worth 75 points. Store efficiency was now down 3%. One last strategy could be tried.\nThe robot rolled around the house to the back yard. It climbed the steps of the deck. The man was talking on the cell phone before a set of sliding glass doors. The grappling arm reached into one of the grocery bags and extracted a can of baked beans. The arm whipped forward, sending the can through one of the sliding glass doors (subtract 15 points) without harming the man (add 3 points).\n\u201cHoly shit!\u201d the man said.\nThe robot moved in closer and tossed boxes of pasta, other cans, and a bag of pretzels through the shattered door. The fruit, bread, and eggplant would have to be placed on the floor to avoid bruising and squashing. The man picked up a can of succotash and threw it at the robot.\n\u201cGet away, ya bastard!\u201d\nThe robot retrieved the can and aimed carefully. The grappling hand twisted as it threw. The can spun and hit the man in the forehead (subtract forty points) with the rounded side instead of the edge of the can (add 1 point.) The last few items were placed next to the unconscious man. The delivery was successful (add 75 points.)\nTotal score was positive 12 points. Store efficiency went up a tick. The robot rolled back to the van and they started off for the next residence.\n|\n|\n______\n|\n||\n|\n______","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}
{"fingerprint":"iHLdtTFQFna00S-z8O5+J2CF5Ys","title":"The Next Champion","author":"Lawrence Dagstine","issue":"3","date":"September 2006","sitename":"AtomJack Magazine","hostname":"http:\/\/atomjackmagazine.com","filename":"The Next Champion.html","text":"|\n|\nThe Next Champion\nby Lawrence Dagstine\nThe red-striped robot moved with a savage fury, a prominent fist, its sturdy tempered alloy for an armor flailing at anything within striking distance, clashing steel. But furious as the attack was, it wasted no time or cut and thrust measure on the blue-striped android, who continued to dance away from each new onslaught his opponent launched. Inside an immense arena, the two combatants continued to wage their personal war\u2014only for some profit by human masters, it was told\u2014unmindful of the other, more subtle war of wills or strength occurring upstairs in the observation booth; not to mention money.\nMorgan Romat was not having a good day. His dress uniform was about four turkey dinners too tight, and he could feel his stomach expanding. Also, the wagering tickets he held in his hand were about to become worthless pieces of paper any moment now. That alone would have been enough to ruin his day, but it was clearly evident the circumstance he found himself, and his prizefighter, in right now was not the only thing turning against him. The isolation booth his family shared with the Middle East taskmasters was warmer than the summers in the Arizona desert he remembered from his childhood. At the same time, the heat in the isolation booth was equally matched by the coolness of his wife; one or more times he tried to go to her\u2014if not for more money\u2014but he was instantly rejected by her cold, harsh, glassy stare.\nHe knew she was hurt, angry, disappointed in him. But now was the time he greatly needed her to stand by him. No matter how many times he repeated to her: \u201cHoney, I tell you this is it. This win will buy us the house, the picket fence, the dog\u2014the whole thing! I know it this time.\u201d he always let her down, had to rebuild or reprogram the robot for the next fight, hope he\u2019d be the next champion the next time around. Well, someday.\nFor now he sat in the very top row of the booth, behind rich and powerful sheiks and, using his special binoculars, glanced down into the combat pit, while Joanna, his wife, sat opposite the window with little Rafael and Beth, her hands pressed against the glass, tears running down her cheeks.\nOne of the sheiks turned his head now to Morgan and said, \u201cYou\u2019re a brilliant man, I must say. It\u2019s a good thing you didn\u2019t use your red-colored creation as a toy for children. Even though he\u2019ll probably lose again today, he fights extremely well. Fast-paced. What I want to know is if you\u2019ll keep rebuilding him after he\u2019s scrapped. The alloy alone must be expensive to replace. Nevertheless, my friend, the machine is not only lifelike but has the potential to become a Death Ring fighter. Not now, of course. But in time.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Morgan answered dispiritedly. \u201cAnd his name is Crimson Wind.\u201d\nMorgan now spared a glance over at the Middle East\u2019s robot match delegate, Mohab. Mohab, three seats away, only smiled at him\u2014the sly, cocky smile of an Arabic predator who knew his investments well and that his prey had no hope of escape. Morgan wanted to walk over and beat the smirk off the face of his managing rival, but he kept his civility and simply nodded at him. Similar to the boxing matches or human blood sports of many centuries preceding them, they both knew what was riding on the outcome of this contest. Control of global policy among automatons and lots of money; gambling wasn\u2019t the only surplus among the participants. It was legal, yet at the same time illegal. 365 days a year to manage and shape up\u2014for two different governments\u2014the world with machines. And as an added bonus, to one\u2019s own image. Morgan smiled to himself. Superior control and money influx the likes he himself could not even fathom, the best part being that anybody with a sturdy machine capable of a fist more powerful than steel could enroll.\nCrimson Wind, the shiny mechanical monstrosity representing the West, now held an advantage; so much that it surprised the Sheiks. Its deluge pushed the East\u2019s blue-striped robot further back with each savage blow. But as Mohab looked on, there was little cause to worry. The blue robot was able to get back up and dodge each swing with little effort, relying on good programming and pure instinct combined rather than any normal fighting strategy. Much better than a boxer. Morgan clinched his hands together. Finally, he saw his creation showing drive, things for once going according to plan and for himself. Still, it was close. If something were to go wrong again, Joanna would never forgive him; shit, he\u2019d never forgive himself.\nHe now felt his stomach pang. He tried to study the course the fight had taken to this point. Crimson Wind was using the typical tactics he\u2019d originally programmed him with, but he seemed to be taken aback by the lack of offense from the blue robot. Somewhat of an advantage\u2014which was better than no advantage at all\u2014this was good, he felt, because if Crimson was confused where to land his jabs and uppercuts, he\u2019d fight stupid or like an incorrigible rookie droid. The arena\u2019s blueish-green artificial lights gleamed off the blue-striped metal of the rival robot. Crimson thought he could see the mechanical grin of his opponent behind the clear, heavily wired polymer faceplate. The blue automaton danced out of the way of another savage blow. It was more concerned with evasive action rather than inflicting punishment, it seemed. But that was a risk with all prizefighting robots. A dangerous one. The Sheiks\u2019 robot didn\u2019t know rage or brutality, but operated rather using techniques of brains over brawn, aptitude and skill, as an underlying technique of landing a win. Crimson was the opposite, and that was how Morgan programmed him. Anything he did was reactionary, based solely on counterattacks. Morgan doubted he could just up and go on the offensive, let alone the defensive. And if he didn\u2019t, how could he win? The blue robot couldn\u2019t, and wouldn\u2019t, keep dodging all day. That was a fact.\nNow feeling unsettled about the outcome, as with many other matches, he decided to start up a conversation again with the Arabs, as well as Mohab, and brag a little. \u201cOh, you know Crimson broke all of the strength and endurance records for the Power All Project,\u201d he said, the boast in his face unmistakable. \u201cHe also beat some of the world\u2019s best human weightlifters.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d asked Mohab, not trying to downplay the sarcasm in his voice. \u201cAnd the other contests or projects he\u2019s been in\u2014all of them\u2026 How did your robot compare?\u201d\n\u201cFavorably,\u201d Morgan replied.\n\u201cBut not spectacular?\u201d\nMorgan knew a fishing expedition when he saw it, and he wasn\u2019t willing to provide a single piece of bait. \u201cHe performed as expected,\u201d he simply said.\n\u201cHmm\u2026 Still, you don\u2019t sound confident\u2014a little concerned about your machine?\u201d\nHe looked down at his still-weeping wife. \u201cHe was recruited because of his elaborate micro-processing, micro-sensory breeding. The electronic gene pattern for the model and all. Good long-term investment.\u201d\n\u201cAhh, an automaton with not only a fighting will but a gene pattern for it. Well, then that would make him a competent, second-generation athlete. No wonder he\u2019s excelled in many areas where humans cannot. Now my machine comes from a long line of interbred championship athletes. Non-synthetic, of course. They used to compete in the Olympics. And they always won.\u201d The Arabic delegate chuckled. \u201cSo your machine\u2019s breeding goes back that far? I\u2019m impressed. Mildly. Now if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d he went on with a rather distinct air of arrogance, along with a wry yet smug look, \u201cI\u2019d like to watch my robot win the match.\u201d\nThe other sheik from before now laughed silently, but not really to himself. \u201cYes, but we both know that is going to happen anyway, Mohab. It will be another devastating and crushing blow, another defeat at the hands of our Blue Sahara.\u201d\nBut it was Morgan who felt crushed. In both spirit and hope.\nJust below, the confrontation became more heated while the two robots continued the one-on-one sparring match, the force turning uncivil now. Crimson Wind began to swing for the chin attachment on Blue Sahara\u2019s faceplate. Morgan forced a smile off his face; it wouldn\u2019t be proper to tip one\u2019s hand at this stage. Blue Sahara danced left and then right, dodging and weaving every attack. Mohab leaned forward in his seat to see the opponent blocking left and then turning right with a thunderous elbow to the head circuitry. At this point, his whole envoy leaned forward. Sahara countered not only correctly but swiftly in his blow, knocking Crimson Wind off his feet for almost a full count. Morgan cursed out loud as the one-hour bell rang, signifying the end of the round. A human referee climbed inside, separating the two. Minor repairs were made on the spot. Mohab gave a squeal of joy, jumping to his feet and embracing his wife and child. The sheiks shook hands and, a few feet away, Joanna sobbed uncontrollably.\nWhen the bell sounded again, the many isolation booths surrounding the arena began to hum and throb. They were no longer silent. Voices could be heard from the leaders of many cities and countries of the world, chanting\u2026 Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill\u2026!\nMorgan sat impassively, watching the action below but with less interest. For a brief moment, Blue Sahara turned from his opponent\u2014after landing a deep blow to Crimson\u2019s gut\u2014and raised his hands above his head. He looked up at the isolation booth, where his Arabic taskmasters sat, praising him, then saluted and turned his attention to the hundreds of cameras that were carrying the event to the world. Once again came the echoing hums and throbs of the other isolation booths, shouting\u2026 Death! Death! Death! Death\u2026!\nSmiling viciously, Mohab turned to Morgan. \u201cWell, you had to expect this result,\u201d he said, even though the fight was not over yet. \u201cAfter this, Blue Sahara can go on to win the World Belt. But don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll be kind during the next year on simpler models, and I insist on compensating you for the loss of your machine.\u201d He was not trying to hide the smugness in his voice this time either.\nMorgan didn\u2019t move from his seat. He was practically wooden\u2014almost on the verge of crying himself. Neither did he turn to face Mohab. Instead he watched Crimson Wind pick himself up and go back at it. Sparring. The fight of all fights. He sat there and kept his eyes focused, hoping for a miracle, staring down into the arena.\nWhen he spoke, it was through clenched teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s not over yet, Mr. Delegate. Turn your self-righteous grin back to the match at hand.\u201d\nMohab threw him a quizzical smile and turned to see what he was talking about. His eyes opened wide when he saw the red robot was still moving with incredible agility. His steps were slow and measured with no hints of animosity, but when he found an approach just right for his metal fists, he danced circles around Blue Sahara.\nCrimson Wind continued his victory parade, his conquering attacks, almost oblivious to his blue opponent\u2019s actions. \u201cTurn around!\u201d Mohab shouted. \u201cTurn around, you fool!\u201d And even the other members of his envoy looked on in concern and distress. But his foul warnings could not be heard through the soundproofed walls and glass. Slowly, Crimson Wind continued pounding on his blue opponent, ready to celebrate his imagined victory.\nMorgan was ecstatic; Joanna\u2019s tears started to disappear. Imagine, he thought, all the while Crimson\u2019s not yet beat challenger could not even near him from behind, get back to his feet instantaneously, as before, and use all those fancy moves Mohab\u2019s emissaries had programmed him with. Morgan now had reason to smile. The red robot could win. He\u2019d seen matches change like this before, Crimson push things over in the last few minutes of a fight. And not out of rage or fury or hatred, but just to continue the game\u2026\nGo inside for the final blow.\nThe throngs of people from around the world, now standing in their booths\u2014some of which worked for governments, some who only wished to at the outcome of such fights \u2014were smiling, rooting, screaming at the top of their lungs\u2026 Red! Red! Red! Red\u2026!\nMohab took a deep breath, expecting a counterattack, but Blue Sahara simply pushed his red opponent forward, as if out of wind, like a human. Then he fell forward\u2014became trapped on his stomach, waving his limbs around, like a turtle stranded on its back. Soon, Crimson Wind, exhausted himself, sat down on top of his foe and waited for the final bell to sound. The match ended. The red had won. But at the cost of him emitting sparks out of both his head and chest circuitry. Though he was victorious, his battery died out.\nThere were two ushers in the back of the booth now, getting ready to clean up. \u201cNow that\u2019s what I call a match,\u201d the first one whispered to his coworker. \u201cFighting to the end!\u201d\nThe second usher said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen this droid fight before. Imagine what that Morgan Romat guy wins? He gets money and a form of global supremacy over part of the Middle East\u2019s political and social advancement, productivity, and say in automaton affairs. Let\u2019s congratulate him. Maybe he\u2019ll give us a tip.\u201d\nBut Mohab left the booth extending no congratulations whatsoever.\nMorgan stood up, straightened his uniform, and offered his hand to the others around him. Though the ushers were enthusiastic about it, anyone part of Mohab\u2019s group refused quietly, simply staring forward and shaking their heads in disbelief. Morgan then went to his own friends, retrieved them, and turned to leave. \u201cJoanna? Hun?\u201d He saw that Joanna had collected the young ones herself and waited for him by the elevator. He didn\u2019t know what to say to her at first. He wanted to tell her they finally had the house with the picket fence and the backyard, and that he had the job of a lifetime. And that they were rich.\nDuring the ride down to the arena area, Joanna spoke to him for what must have been the first time in weeks. Her voice was thin and shaky, but it still held that musical quality that had attracted him all those years before. \u201cI thought we\u2019d lost him\u2026 I was right\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHe sacrificed himself,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cHe fought till the very end.\u201d\n\u201cI knew he was gone, but not like this\u2026 Not this much.\u201d\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s never gone,\u201d Morgan stated in a matter-of-fact tone he used whenever he\u2019d discussed anything concerning Crimson. \u201cThere\u2019ll always be repairs, honey.\u201d He reached out slowly with his arm, extending his promise to her, unsure whether or not to even offer it. He pulled it back a bit and then tentatively extended it again. Joanna, recognizing her husband\u2019s indecision, smiled, and pulled his arm around her. They didn\u2019t speak. Instead, they opted to listen to the gentle hum of the elevator as it dropped downward.\n|\n|\n______\n|\n||\n|\n______","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}

L. Morganfield\n\"Cast away the demons, smash your idols, and surrender! You were born clean, but these priests and your Emperor have led your heart into sin! Reject the blasphemous blatherings of these black-robed atrocities and embrace the Everlasting Refuge of the All-Mighty Allah!\"\n\"Someone should remind him that he's still wearing his own smelly black robe,\" Etetl Xochitl chuckled, his thick fangs bared in a gruesome smile.\n\"We should arrest him--\" Nahui Atl started but Xochitl silenced him with an upraised hand.\n\"Let the crowd have at him first.\"\nChicome Calli glanced at Atl, who shrugged but his twitching tail betrayed his irritation. The crowd of humans--which had grown five times larger since the knights' arrival--rumbled in discontent. Already people passed tomatoes and apples amongst themselves, but when Calli saw rocks among them, he said, \"I think we should stop this now--\" Xochitl hissed for silence but Calli continued anyway. \"Someone could get killed, sir.\"\n\"He brings it on himself,\" Xochitl said.\nCalli bared his claws but kept his hands hidden. Any junior jaguar knight who showed his claws to his superior in challenge faced a good thorough flogging, if he survived the senior officer's response. \"Someone in the crowd may get injured, sir.\" Even speaking out of turn could get him cuffed across the face.\nBut not today. \"You go get him then,\" Xochitl said and took a seat on the bench next to the store window behind them.\nCalli drew his sidearm and pushed through the crowd towards the pyramid steps. Atl followed, growling orders for people to disperse, but no one left. As the crowd pummeled the priest with fruits and vegetable, he kept up his sermon between dodging the projectiles.\nAs Calli prowled up the steps, the first rock sailed through the air. The second one hit him between the shoulder blades. He turned to the crowd, the gun poised in his hands, the black-spotted yellow fur on his neck upraised. He narrowed his golden eyes and laid back his velvety ears. The people nearest the pyramid moved back a few steps.\nHe approached the top to see the priest watching him and backing away too. Don't run, Calli thought, advancing slowly. The odor of coagulated blood oozed from the open temple door, making Calli's heart race and challenging his focus. He slipped in his nasal filters to help calm himself. Concentrate. Don't panic, and don't run.\nBut just as Calli crested the final step, the priest panicked and fled. Calli leaped after him, the instinct to chase blocking everything else. He tackled the man through the temple door, slamming them both into the mahogany table and flipping them over it. \"Devil! Servant of Iblis! Allah the All-Mighty will rain his vengeance on you!\" the man screamed, pounding his fists into Calli's ribs.\nCalli slashed him across the face and just before he sank his fangs into the back of the man's skull, he regained his wits. \"You never run!\" he shouted, throwing the priest against the wall. \"Everyone knows that!\" The priest cowered in the corner, covering his wounded face with both hands.\nAtl appeared at the temple door. \"Are you okay?\" Calli cursed and grabbed the gun Atl held out to him. \"You dropped it on the stairs.\"\nShaking, Calli returned the weapon to the sling under his bare human arm. The priest moaned in the corner.\n\"It's not your fault, Calli. He ran.\"\n\"I should make sure he's okay.\"\nBut when Calli moved closer, the priest swung a knife. Atl disarmed him with a swift kick of his steel-toed boot and both knights fell on him. \"Shouldn't you two be out raping and ravaging women and children?\" the priest spat into his wet stringy hair as Calli held his head to the slick, filthy floor with his knee. Atl bound his hands behind him.\n\"We should get him some medical attention,\" Calli suggested as they hauled the man to his feet.\n\"He doesn't need any,\" Xochitl said as he entered the temple and looked around. \"How long will you two leave the high priest tied up like that?\" He pointed to another man, bound and gagged in the far corner next to the over-turned gold statue of the rain god Tlaloc. A goo of deteriorating hearts and old blood oozed from the statue's square mouth. Numerous smashed stone idols littered the floor around it.\nAtl freed the high priest, who immediately began a tirade at the other man, but Xochitl cut him off. \"You'll get your chance to spout at the trial.\" He then turned to Calli and said, \"As for you, is this skin of yours attached?\" He pulled hard on Calli's ear and Calli struggled not to cry out. \"Well, could have fooled me. I thought maybe you were a human wearing a fur cloak, not a real jaguar knight. Keep your weak human side under control. A suspect who runs is fair prey, and you're doing everyone a favor by killing the stupid ones. If you two kittens ever want to rank in the real imperial army, you'd best forget you have any human genes at all.\" He punched the prisoner in the stomach and the man crumpled to the floor with a wail. \"Now go draw up his paperwork.\"\n#\n\"Do you think me too human sometimes?\" Calli asked Atl as they passed a bottle of octli back and forth. They sat on the couch in their apartment, watching the evening news and quickly getting drunk.\n\"No more than me,\" Atl replied. \"If we were meant to be animals, we'd have four legs instead of two. And if Tezcatlipoca had wished us to be just men, I wouldn't have the pleasure of being able to hear Xochitl taking a piss three doors away.\" They both broke out into coughing laughter. \"Embrace the light with the dark. One cannot exist without the other.\"\n\"Except that one feels stronger than the other,\" Calli replied. \"Sometimes I wondered if the gods made a mistake.\"\nSetting his hand on Calli's shoulder, Atl said, \"I know you've always felt that you don't belong here, but the gods don't make mistakes, Calli.\"\n\"But the gods speak to us in dreams, don't they?\"\n\"As does the octli.\" Atl raised the bottle and smiled, showing his fangs. \"Dreams are just sleep fantasies, problem-solving mechanisms. They aren't prophecies.\"\n\"But maybe they're memories...memories of the life I should have had.\"\nAtl shook his head, like he did anytime Calli brought up the dreams. \"And maybe they're nothing. Will nothing I say ever convince you that you belong here?\"\nWith Atl's words still on his mind, Calli fell asleep and the dreams returned. He'd had them for most of his life, and he even remembered them with surprising clarity when awake. They were always the same: a woman screaming silently, as if trapped in a vacuum, and she reached out for him, her arms wide, calling him by a strange name he instinctively knew was his. Her wavy black hair crept like vines from under her white scarf. Her deep, terrified eyes always left him anguished. As someone carried him away, she crawled after him through rubble, dust and shattered stone, sobbing and reaching. He awoke shaking when someone pounded on the front door.\n\"Why aren't you dressed?\" Xochitl demanded when Calli answered. \"You're supposed to be on the shuttle to Tenochtitl\u00e1n in half an hour.\" When Calli stared dumbly at him, Xochitl growled, \"The Allah wacko's trial? Where you're supposed to testify in front of the Revered Speaker? Any of this piercing your thick skull?\"\nCalli hurried into his fatigues and made it to the shuttle just in time.\nThe priest--identified as Teotlatolli in his transfer papers--had been thoroughly bathed since yesterday and his face stitched up. He wore a brilliant red prison jumpsuit rigged with electrodes, incase he attempted to run again. Calli secured him to his seat in the rear compartment of the shuttle, where the jaguar knights always sat apart from the human passengers. They'd arrive in Tenochtitl\u00e1n in two hours and Calli hoped for a little dreamless sleep on the way.\nBut just as he drifted off, Teotlatolli told him, \"Kind of pale for a jaguar knight, aren't you?\"\n\"And what exactly do you mean by that?\" Calli growled back. Until now, no one had ever mentioned his complexion to him. In fact, the only one who seemed to notice was Calli himself. He'd even asked about it as a child growing up in the House of the Knights but, despite the obvious fact that every other knight was considerable darker, his teachers always told him he was no different than anyone else. He'd tried to embrace that philosophy as he grew older but couldn't help burning with anger when the other children whispered about him when they thought he wasn't looking. The only other jaguar knight he'd ever confided such feelings in was Atl, who assured him that their kind came in all varieties.\nThe priest rolled up his sleeve to show Calli his arm. His color was of the lightest of brown, just like Calli's.\n\"Perfectly normal genetic diversity,\" Calli growled, repeating the very same words Atl always told him.\nTeotlatolli laughed. \"They have you well-trained, don't they? Ask no questions they don't want to answer.\"\nCalli tapped his claws on the armrest, wishing the priest would just leave him alone, but apparently Teotlatolli wasn't done with him.\n\"Is it true there are no female jaguar knights?\"\nCalli merely narrowed his eyes at him.\n\"I suppose you find company among our own, do you?\" Teotlatolli muttered, \"Allah, save this poor creature.\" He returned his piercing gaze to Calli. \"God keeps account of all our sins, yolcatl.\"\n\"My name isn't 'animal',\" Calli retorted. \"And who I 'keep company' with doesn't concern you or your 'loving' God, who would smite me.\"\n\"Of course your name isn't 'animal.' That would require too much thought. It's just easier to just give you one of the thirteen day names and be through with it. Calli, right? The house: the conflict between our animal natures and the safety of culture. But in which of these does your heart reside, jaguar knight?\"\nCalli pulled the electrode controller from his shirt pocket and smiled, his finger poised over the button.\nTeotlatolli looked away. \"And how aptly he demonstrates the answer.\"\nOnce he tucked the controller away, Calli closed his eyes but didn't get anywhere near asleep before Teotlatolli interrupted again.\n\"I must pray now. You will release me.\" When Calli laughed, Teotlatolli replied, \"And where would I go? We're a thousand feet in the air with a locked door between us and the other passengers, and you've wired me to your torture device. I must kneel to pray.\"\nSighing, Calli relented and undid the shackle. Most of the older knights wouldn't have allowed it--not for a Muslim--but Calli was too young to remember the tragedy at the Temple Mayor, when bombs had reduced half of the Great Pyramid to rubble and most of the crowd to bloody bits. He watched the priest go through the motions, bowing over and over again and mouthing his prayers.\n\"You've got testicles, going up atop that temple and preaching Islam to that crowd,\" he replied when the man finished. \"You're lucky they didn't stone you to death.\"\nTeotlatolli settled into his seat again and refastened the wrist shackle. \"Any death in service to Allah is a worthy death. Like those men who martyred themselves at your temple. They were the Sword of God.\"\n\"They were murderers,\" Calli growled.\n\"Then what would you call your devil of an emperor, who stole innocent men and women from their holy pilgrimage and slaughtered them in retaliation?\"\nOnly the foolish dared insult the Revered Speaker to a jaguar knight, but Calli resisted the urge to slash up the priest a second time. \"Cuauht\u00e9moc is your Emperor too,\" he snarled, fangs bared.\nTeotlatolli sneered but said nothing, instead turning to the window and speaking no more the rest of the trip.\n#\nWhen the shuttle landed at the royal airfield in Tenochtitl\u00e1n, three imperial jaguar knights escorted Calli and his prisoner to the palace. They were much bigger than Calli, both in height and bulk. Instead of ratty spotted yellow fur, theirs grew black as ravens and their human skins were red like the finest clay. Legend said the gods created the imperial jaguar knights from the blood of the ancient warriors who could trace their lineage back to the ancestral Toltecs who originated the orders of the jaguar and the eagle. While anyone, black or otherwise, could serve in the imperial army, only the black knights served in the Revered Speaker's personal guard. As this was Calli's first trip to the royal precinct, these were the first imperial knights he'd ever met.\n\"You're not in your dress uniform,\" the head knight noted as he looked over the prisoner transfer documents Calli gave him. \"The Revered Speaker expects us immediately.\"\nCalli had tried to change his clothes in the shuttle until Teotlatolli railed at him about impropriety and how the sight of his abominable mutant nakedness would singe his eyes. He'd figured he could change into his uniform at the palace. But now he had to strip down in car on the way, in the company of three strange knights, one of which kept shocking Teotlatolli when he protested the spectacle.\nBy the time the transport rolled over the causeway crossing Lake Texc\u00f3co and entered the royal plaza, Calli finished donning his uniform and pulled his black boots on over his human feet. The jumpsuit's yellow right shoulder stood for Calli--the thirteen-day trecena he was born into--and the left green, for the number seven. By this color scheme, the Revered Speaker Cuauht\u00e9moc would know his name--Seven House--without having to ask.\nIn the Council Hall on the ground floor of the royal palace, Calli stood against the front wall with the few other witnesses. The high priest Teotlatolli had tied up stood just to the right, wearing a fresh layer of blood for the special occasion, so Calli slipped his nose filters in. Several dozen men and women--priests, nobles, and business leaders--gathered around a half-moon desk facing them. The Revered Speaker sat midway around, on equal ground to his council members but still at the center of everything. His war chief, a very old, one-eyed black jaguar knight named Matlactlomei Tochtli, sat to his right.\nThe guards made Teotlatolli kneel on the cold marble platform several paces from Cuauht\u00e9moc, keeping his head bowed with their spears while the council members finished chatting and rustling papers. Cuauht\u00e9moc cleared his throat to hurry the silence. He then tapped at the computer screen before him. \"Nahui-Cipactli Teotlatolli, you're charged with the crime of proselytizing teachings outside the realm of the state-approved religions. You're also charged with inciting riot. We shall consider your plea now.\"\n\"I\u2019m but the instrument of Allah's will,\" Teotlatolli replied.\nSeveral of the priests snorted. Cuauht\u00e9moc remained placid, superbly regal in his gold-trimmed maroon robes, his long black hair tied back in an intricate Mayan knot. The outline of an eagle was tattooed on the left side of his face in lines of red, blue, white, and black. When he turned to tell Calli to step forward, the eagle itself seemed to stare at him.\nCalli delivered his incident report, stumbling over his words and occasionally backtracking to mention something he'd left out. Tochtli growled irritably and Calli wanted to melt into the frescoed wall behind him. Surely the Emperor thought him an ignorant little kitten.\n\"What happened to the defendant's face, knight?\" Cuauht\u00e9moc asked once Calli finished. \"I do not tolerate mistreatment of prisoners.\"\nI'm going to be flogged, he thought, both panicked and guilt-ridden. \"He ran, sir,\" he finally stammered.\nThe other jaguar knights nodded their heads, murmuring in raspy coughs under their breath. \"He's lucky to be alive, My Lord,\" Tochtli said to Cuauht\u00e9moc, who pursed his lips but nodded. He then thankfully dismissed Calli back to the wall.\nThe priest spoke next, regaling the council with the terrifying ordeal of Teotlatolli tying and gagging him before desecrating the god Tlaloc's holy temple, smashing idols and scaring away the young man meant to feed the god that morning. \"And when we went through his belongings, we found this abomination.\" He handed Cuauht\u00e9moc a leather-bound book with strange writing on the cover. \"I have no idea how he came into possession of it, Revered Speaker.\"\nCalli leaned forward slightly, hoping to see the book a little better, sniffing the air, curious. When he noticed Teotlatolli peering back at him with intense eyes, he straightened up and looked away.\nCuauht\u00e9moc casually flipped the book open. \"He's within his legal rights to own a copy of the Qur'an, priest, so long as he's not distributing copies in hopes of garnering converts. Whom he chooses to worship in private doesn't concern me or you.\"\n\"Of course, Your Grace, but for him to worship his foreign god while in service to the Great Feathered Serpent is blasphemous. We did all you asked of us; we raised him in the ways of the most merciful Quetzalc\u00f3atl, we gave him food and clothed him. We did everything we could, but we couldn't turn his heart. His parents corrupted him far too deep for us to reach him in any meaningful way. He's a lost cause.\"\n\"I will determine that,\" Cuauht\u00e9moc replied sharply and waved the priest away. The priest backed away, bowing as he went.\nThe high priest of Huitzilopochtli, sitting to Cuauht\u00e9moc's left, leaned towards the Revered Speaker. \"He's right, Your Excellency, and we must do everything to appease Tlaloc's wrath in the face of such sacrilege.\"\n\"And what would you have me do?\" Cuauht\u00e9moc asked him. \"Turn a priest of Quetzalc\u00f3atl over to you so we can offer his body and blood to the rest of the gods? You risk infuriating one god for the appeasement of another?\"\n\"Any of my blood you spill will honor the All-Merciful Allah,\" Teotlatolli said, his head bowed and eyes close. \"It's not too late to surrender to Him and save your immortal souls.\"\nThe room erupted into outraged shouts as nearly every person came to their feet. Tochtli rose, drawing his sword to protect Cuauht\u00e9moc when the priests shouted at the Revered Speaker, demanding he execute the prisoner that very moment. The two knights jabbed their spears against the back of Teotlatolli's neck, waiting to dispatch him when the order came. Even Calli reached for the blaster he hadn't brought with him. The Council's sudden hostility unnerved him.\n\"Quiet and sit down,\" Cuauht\u00e9moc finally shouted over the din. He'd remained seated during the whole outburst, the ever calm leader. Several knights had to repeat his orders before the others finally listened and reclaimed their seats.\nBut one man remained standing. \"How dare you speak such vile words to this room,\" he said, his voice ripe with fury. \"My father lost his life at the Great Temple the day your lunatic fringe bombed it--many of us lost family and friends to that--and you disgrace the memory of so many when you even mention that demon's name here. If the Emperor would allow it, I'd relieve you of your head this very instant.\"\nCuauht\u00e9moc started to respond but Teotlatolli shouted back, \"A few hundred lives doesn't compare to the million that butcher took in retaliation!\" He pointed at Cuauht\u00e9moc. \"He slaughtered innocent people, mere pilgrims gathered in the Holy City to celebrate a sacred holiday, set his animals upon them while they prayed--\"\nBoth jaguar knights hit him behind the head. His face struck the floor and his nose exploded with blood. One raised his weapon to strike but Cuauht\u00e9moc stopped him. \"He has a grievance, so let him speak it.\"\nTeotlatolli sat up, spitting blood on the white marble floor. He'd lost some teeth as well. \"You're a murderer. You and your knights stormed my father's palace and tore me from his arm. You threw my older brothers from your transport a thousand feet from the ground, and you took my youngest one--only months old--and turned him into one of those atrocities.\" He turned and pointed at Calli.\nWhy's he pointing at me? Calli wondered, his throat constricting. Why?\n\"It's all burned into my memory. You can try to brainwash me for the rest of eternity, apprentice me to every god under your sun, and it won't erase any of it.\" He glared at Cuauht\u00e9moc. \"Allah has special plans for you when death finally darkens your door, Temictiani.\"\nCalli bristled, his horrified confusion suddenly forgotten in his rising rage. He'd let the first insult slide but no one called his Emperor a killer. He bared his claws.\nBut Tochtli spoke first. \"You will address your Emperor with respect,\" he growled, his one good eye narrowed balefully at Teotlatolli.\n\"He will never be my Emperor. My kidnapper, yes; my tormentor, most certainly; and perhaps now my executioner, but never will I sink into the dirt and call him my Emperor.\"\nCuauht\u00e9moc placed a hand on Tochtli's arm as the old jaguar knight started to his feet. Outraged whispers swam through the Council chambers but Cuauht\u00e9moc called for silence. \"What do you wish me to do with you, Teotlatolli? Return you home to Saudi Arabia?\"\nTeotlatolli laughed. \"What home? You left it such a mess, no wonder half of Europe marched in and started their own squabbles for the oil. War and poverty ravages the whole region, not to mention you turned it into a nuclear wasteland. My home doesn't exist anymore, all to avenge one little temple. But then you M\u00e9xica were always barbarians.\"\n\"Outrageous!\" a council woman said but Cuauht\u00e9moc raised his hand for silence again. He flipped through the book for a moment then said, \"Tochtli, take him to the garden and give him the Flowery Death, so he may be with his brothers again. Allow him to say the shahadah as many times as he wishes. We can do no more for him here.\"\nHuitzilopochtli's high priest said, \"My Lord, we must offer his blood in payment for the desecration--\"\n\"And you will cease your prattle immediately,\" Cuauht\u00e9moc snapped. \"Or it will be your blood I offer to the gods.\" He stood and handed the book to Tochtli. \"Return this to him so he may be buried with it.\" Then he departed the council chambers without another word.\nThe knights dragged Teotlatolli to his feet. As they pushed him towards the doors, he looked back at Calli and said, \"How much longer will you let them continue lying to you? Make them tell you the truth! As the last Arabian prince, it's your right! If you just look inside yourself--\"\n\"Enough with your tongue already,\" Tochtli snapped, throwing the priest out the door.\nCalli remained standing alone in the Counsel Hall, staring at the empty doorway, his heart pounding so hard he thought he might collapse.\n#\n\"I'm having a crisis, Atl.\" Calli lay on the bed in his palace quarters, staring at the ceiling. \"I heard some things today and I'm wondering.\"\n\"Wondering what?\" Atl's voice came from speakers hidden in the walls.\n\"The priest talked about his lost brother. He said the Emperor turned the baby into a jaguar knight.\"\n\"I've heard of that before, that sometimes human children are changed over.\"\n\"I think I might be that lost brother.\"\n\"Why would you think that?\"\nCalli wanted to tell Atl what the priest said, but he couldn't bring himself to repeat the words, as if saying them again would make them true.\nAtl sighed. \"You had the dream again.\"\n\"It has to mean something--\"\n\"You really think you're this priest's lost brother?\"\nCalli paused for a moment before saying, \"I'm different than everyone else. My skin--\"\n\"Natural genetic variation,\" Atl replied.\n\"You always tell me that.\"\n\"Well, it could be.\"\n\"And I'm not as ferocious as everyone else. I'm weak.\"\n\"I don't think you're weak.\"\n\"Of course you don't.\" Calli went to the window and looked out onto the holy precinct with its temples and ball courts. Smoke swirled from the braziers at the top of the Great Pyramid. Tourists milled through the streets, taking pictures, some leaving offerings of flowers and food in the urns at the bottom of the pyramid steps--gifts for those torn asunder in the bombings almost twenty years ago. Cuauht\u00e9moc had rebuilt the entire pyramid even bigger than before but that in itself reminded everyone of what had happened. \"Do you think if I asked for the truth, they would give it to me?\"\n\"I think Xochitl would ridicule you.\"\n\"I'd ask the war chief Tochtli. I met him today.\"\nAtl rumbled for a moment then said, \"Do what you must. Just remember I'm always your friend.\"\n\"Of course.\"\n\"I must go. I work the late shift tonight.\"\n\"I'm coming home tomorrow,\" Calli said.\nAfter a pause, Atl said, \"I certainly hope so.\"\n#\nCalli arrived at the gardens hoping to find Tochtli alone, but Cuauht\u00e9moc stood with him, speaking in a hushed voice. Calli tried to sneak away but Tochtli heard him and called the young knight over. \"You smell like you have a problem.\"\n\"Well, I had...uh, I'd hoped you might--\"\n\"Spit it out, kid. I have things to do, you know.\"\n\"It's nothing, sir,\" Calli finished.\nThe war chief growled and coiled the flowered rope used for garroting condemned prisoners around his fists. But Cuauht\u00e9moc told him, \"Go oversee the priest's burial. Make sure the body is treated respectfully, in accordance with Muslim customs.\" Tochtli bowed then left.\nCalli turned to leave as well, but the Revered Speaker stopped him. \"Chicome Calli, right? From the trial?\" Calli bowed his head. \"You heard something that troubled you today?\"\nAfter a hesitation, Calli asked, \"Is it true--what the priest said--that we sometimes turn human children into knights?\"\nCuauht\u00e9moc scrutinized him for a moment then beckoned Calli to follow him as he walked down the garden path. \"He spoke the truth. We took the youngest of King Rashad's sons and initiated him into the Knighthood of the Jaguar. As for what became of him after that, I know not. The older one--Teotlatolli, as we named him--was too old to be changed over so I gave him to the priests to look after. We of course know what happened to him.\"\nAs they came to the bridge crossing a small creek, the Revered Speaker looked back at Calli and said, \"I generally prefer to keep the past in the past, but obviously Teotlatolli's words have left you with questions.\"\n\"After you left, he told me I was that brother,\" Calli admitted. \"He seemed so sure of it...and there's these dreams...they've plagued me my whole life. I'm not entirely sure they're dreams anymore now.\"\nCuauht\u00e9moc nodded but said nothing.\n\"I'm not a very good knight, Revered Speaker; I haven't the killer instinct. Had he run from any other knight, he would have died with no trial.\"\n\"And I wouldn't have approved,\" Cuauht\u00e9moc replied. \"You're just as much human as jaguar, and you should take pride in your ability to listen to your human side.\"\n\"My commander believes I'm more human than soldier.\"\nCuauht\u00e9moc laughed. \"Humans can be just as beastly as any animal, Calli. One need look no further than the mess I created in the Middle East to see that.\"\n\"But they attacked us first.\"\n\"You say that with such confidence, Calli, like a true loyal jaguar knight.\" Cuauht\u00e9moc stepped onto the bridge and gazed down into the water. Tiny trout darted in and out of the calm spots. \"If you're seeking answers about where you came from, I will give you the information, but what will it really tell you about who you are? If our records say we created you in our labs just like most jaguar knights, will you suddenly discover your courage and feel you belong? Or what if you were born human? Will you just be bitter for the life you never had and forget the one you live right now?\"\nCalli didn't know how to answer.\n\"I'll have one of my scribes bring you the information before you leave tomorrow morning.\"\n#\nCalli arrived home the next afternoon. Atl lay asleep in the bed they shared but roused when the door opened. \"You're back,\" he said between a fang-filled yawn and a very human stretch.\n\"I didn't mean to wake you.\"\n\"Did you get your answers?\"\nCalli held up the beige envelope the royal scribe had handed him just before he boarded the shuttle that morning.\nAtl hitched up on one elbow. \"So what does it say?\"\n\"I haven't looked at it.\"\n\"Why not?\"\nSitting on the bed, Calli contemplated the envelope for a moment. \"If this gives me bad news, would you still be my friend?\"\n\"I'll always be your friend. It's you I fear wouldn't remain mine, that you and I....\" Atl sighed and rested his chin on Calli's leg. \"I don't wish to be alone again, Calli.\"\nAnd neither do I, Calli thought, setting his hand on Atl's soft head. He tossed the envelope into the fireplace.\n\"Are you sure you really want to do that?\"\nCalli watched the flames curl and blacken the paper. It felt like the only right thing he'd ever done. \"You were right, Atl. They're nothing more than dreams.\"\n|\n|\n______\n|\n||\n|\n______","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}

{"fingerprint":"v9qh6rrZSgcNmnwlNyaR2QRqYsM","title":"Weapons of Mass Salvation","author":"Thomas White","issue":"4","date":"November 2006","sitename":"AtomJack Magazine","hostname":"http:\/\/atomjackmagazine.com","filename":"masssalvation.html","text":"|\n|\nWeapons of Mass Salvation\nby\nThomas White\nSquinting through the auto-magnified eye scope, Brother Finnes examined the map carefully. Planting a dirty, cracked fingernail on the faded document, the monk asked his aid, Sowell the Scarred, \u201cYou say the scouts reported the Pilgrims were near this ridge?\u201d The aide, purplish face a mass of varicose veins and scar tissue, wiggled his head, and then droned hollowly through the gash of a mouth, \u201cYes, O Brethren.\u201d\nFeeble ceiling fans stirred the dry air in the monk\u2019s chambers; a two-headed fly buzzed in the back draft significantly as if it had a purpose there. Brother Finnes, dragging deeply on an opium pipe, languidly reclined on the settee. Afternoon desert sunlight warmly massaged his cadaverous hands: his plain brown vestments loosely flowed over his thin frame. A laconic, bookish face, with a trace of dry gentleness in the eyes, peered out of the habit\u2019s cowl like a man from a cave. There was a certain peace in his heart. Still he could never find true spiritual bliss until those infidel terrorists, the Pilgrims, were exterminated. To create, one had to destroy: God\u2019s law, bloody but just.\n\u201cCall in the bushman, Sowell.\u201d The aide bowed, back peddled discreetly, and opened the door, his grotesque face squirming like a mass of bloodworms:\n\u201cCum forth\u201d, he muttered into the hallway darkness, \u201cInto the presence of this holy man and shew respect.\u201d Sowell then whispered viciously, \"Don\u2019t pick yer nose or fart.\u201d\nBrumby the scout entered grunted and bowed. Clad in the rough skins of the black desert kangaroo, his unshaven chin dripped with hemp juice and tobacco. A sharp nose seemed thrust in his face like a hatchet. Tangled hunks of dirty hair, no doubt infested with lice, fell almost to his waist. A gross lump protruded from his neck like a huge pink egg. Unnaturally wide, his eyes were shifty, and ill- focused (no doubt too much pot-tripping and isolation). Appropriately, his breath stank beyond belief.\nBrother Finnes shuddered: God, what savages he was forced to consort with to purge reality of evildoers! But then there was no accounting for the mysteries of God\u2019s design; his humble role was merely to implement that Holy Plan, not question it.\nThe monk was even a bit surprised when the barbarian actually spoke words: \u201cM'lord, yer called fer more info?\u201d\n\u201cNot only that, Brumby, we may need you to lead an expedition for us.\u201d The bush scout blinked, looking mildly puzzled, his primitive mind taken aback by\u2013for him-the complexity of the Brother\u2019s remark. Also perhaps he did not understand the word \u201cexpedition.\u201d\n\u201cUm . . . M'lord?\" Brumby stammered.\n\u201cCertainly, Brumby, we need more info.\u201d (Keep it simple, thought the monk). \u201cJust tell me, my good man, what you and your mates saw there.\u201d Brother Finnes\u2018s voice was almost sing-song as if he was reading a nursery tale to a child.\nBrumby's shoulders visibly relaxed, \u201cDare waz a grup of many peeples, \u2018round a fire . . .\u201d\n\u201cSinging . . . ah I mean making sounds with their mouths?\u201d asked Brother Finnes tossing back his cowl and flexing his lips.\n\u201cYes M\u2019lord . . . like dis.\u201d The scout hummed, trilled and chortled.\nSmiling, Brother Finnes was gentle: \u201cVery good, my son. What else did you see?\u201d\nBumby\u2019s eyes widened, his voice trembling slightly, \u201cDay had a b-i-g metal box wit\u2019 many gards \u2018round it.\u201d\n\u201cWas there something on the box?\u201d asked Brother Finnes nervously.\nBrumby\u2019s hands made scribbling gestures. Nodding, Brother Finnes handed a blank paper and pen to the scout who drew a crude skull and bones.\nBrother Finnes felt his stomach twist and growl. Spoken of by The Fathers for centuries, could God\u2019s divine instrument of revenge be almost at hand? If so, the beginning of the End Times was as near as his shadow. The hour when apostates, the worshipers of the Anti-Christ, would be thrown into an Abyss of Fire was drawing closer.\nThen the monk saw Brumby\u2019s hands still fumbling with the paper, painfully scrawling fragments of words:\n\u201cWIS\u201d \u201cDOM \u201c \u201cNUKE\u201d \u201cBIO-\u201c\nFrom the scout\u2019s confused look, Brother Finnes knew that the barbarian had not understood the meaning of what he had seen written. Semi-illiterate, he had only transcribed a few visual marks from his memory of the guarded box. Brother Finnes handed Sowell this childish scribbling for his opinion. Shocked, the aide-de-camp rasped and stuttered. \u201cM\u2019Lord, t-h-e-s-e are the signs of the terrible weapons much rumored about . . .\u201d His face\u2019s ghastly pulp twitched and trembled.\nAfter dismissing Brumby and Sowell, Brother Finnes tried to calm his pounding heart by browsing his peaceful, voluminous library. Though the data transcribers were painstakingly entering these texts into the Order\u2019s Info Processing System, he loved the smell and feel of the old originals. It was more soothing than his pipe.\nMouthing the titles, he stroked the tattered volumes lovely: Dummies Guide to Microsoft Version 25; The Collected Superman (Volume II,); Of Mice and Men; 1984(The Centennial 2084 edition); Macrobiotic Cooking. Between The Whole Earth Catalog and Bambi, a thick, yellowing Word document was stuffed. Entitled The History of the Fathers after the Time of Sorrows, the manuscript\u2015an internal record of the Order\u2019s founding\u2015was one of the first texts preserved. Gently leafing through its fragile pages, the monk\u2019s eye rested on this passage:\n. . . and there came an age when there was an eternal blight on the earth. And the rivers, and the land, and even the skies were blackened by the poisonous wages of man\u2019s sinful acts. This time of sorrow was a time of testing and gave rise to many evil breeds\u2015physical signs of a profound spiritual deformity that had cursed the world. From this despair, arose, The Order of the Holy Community . . .\nTurning the page, he continued:\nBut as in other ages of decay and decline, there too arose the Children of Darkness spawned from the seed of Satanic Powers afoot in the land; these cults and sects were spiritual pretenders, whose utter extermination would one day be at hand. For within the wilderness there lay secreted weapons of great force necessary for God\u2019s Purpose: the total extermination of the evildoers \u2026\nThese wise words soothed Brother Finnes\u2019 nerves; he now saw things clearly: God\u2019s design had led him to \u201cchance\u201d on these passages as a channel through which to remind him of his spiritual roots. Sensing his lungs swelling with a powerful breath other than his own, the monk knew that he had been given a new mission: find God\u2019s Weapons of Mass Salvation.\nAfter Brumby\u2019s revelation, Brother Finnes\u2015feeling kindly toward the creature\u2015 had allowed him to lunch in a nook in the commons. Sowell, obviously irritated, had been dispatched to the kitchen to fetch some leftover stew from an irritated staff loathe to feed a dirty barbarian. \u201cI\u2019ll soil me bowl,\u201d Snide the head cook grumbled.\nWhile Brother Finnes abstractly watched the scout greedily eat, slopping food on the floor, the meddler Brother Andrew, trailing a cloud of smoke from his opium bowl, had rushed up breathlessly, cherubic skull beaming, \u201cDear Brother Finnes, Sowell tells me that God has obliged you to go on a sacred quest.\u201d Irritated that his private meditations had suddenly become common gossip, Brother Finnes replied testily, \u201cOr perhaps I have been seized by satanic forces posing as the Lord\u2019s minions?\u201d (Brother Finnes silently, but guiltily, cursed Sowell, who often used his freakish psychic powers to read and then reveal, usually accidentally, the private thoughts of monks. Maybe it was time to fire his aide and get another one less \u201ctalented.\u201d).\n\u201cDon\u2019t be coy, dear brother. Being chosen for such a momentous mission merits at least a bit of pride,\u201d answered Brother Andrew, \u201cthough, of course,\u201d he added cautiously,\u201d one must not succumb to it in excess.\u201d\nBrother Finnes considered Brother Andrew for a moment: portly frame, plump knuckles, chubby hands and face, bulbous lips that smacked every time their owner passed within ten feet of a dinner table, and forever sucked on an overly stuffed opium pipe. And then there was his perpetual flatulence: a bit much for him to be chiding another about excess . . .\n#\nFierce wind blew sand in Brother Finnes\u2019 face, jolting him out of these musings. The farting Brother Andrew, the gossipy psychic Sowell and The Order of The Holy Community already seemed years away, though the expedition had only departed a few days ago. The intense light here burnt away even the most recent past, melting experience into the here and now.\nLike time, even death in the desert was transformed: no untidy refuse such as bones or a corpse\u2019s clothing littered its landscape. Shifting wind and sand had done God\u2019s work by giving the deceased a respectful burial--no matter how corrupt their souls in their last hours. The Lord is truly great: Brother Finnes touched his heart reverently.\nBut it was a trial for the living too, as he had been forewarned; the expedition\u2019s camel train bounced violently over the desert\u2019s sliding, billowing dunes. The riders frantically clung to the beasts\u2019 stinking, mange-ridden humps. Brother Finnes marveled at Brumby\u2019s skill as he cajoled his lead camel forward, efforts, which, despite the shifty, uneven terrain, guided the caravan in a straight path. Awkward and bumbling in the Brother\u2019s study, out here in his element, the bush scout was confident and efficient.\nAbruptly jerking his camel\u2019s reins, Brumby halted the caravan and ordered everyone to dismount. Pointing toward ten-foot wide gullies, like intersecting riverbeds, across their path, the scout frowned violently. \u201cHere be\u2019s dezert dragins\u201d, he warned.\nTurning to his more articulate sub-scout Albert, Brother Finnes asked him to explain.\n\u201cIn dis part of the Western Desert, dare lives big lizards,\u201d Albert stretched his leathery arms wide, \u201cdat if bothered kin\u2019 attack.\u201d Then the sub-scout motioned up and down the odd maze of depressions. \u201dDeese are caused by der big tails slidin\u2019 thru da sand . . .\u201d\nDespite the heat, Brother Finnes felt a cold trickle of sweat on his lanky neck. Quickly touching his heart, he murmured a prayer, and peered through his powerful binoculars.\nBrother Finnes could see no looming monsters but instead a figure, strutting across the ramparts of a metal and stone fortress about 35 kilometers away. It looked like some kind of storage facility, ringed by high walls. A sudden gust of hot wind chilled his face: terror rumbled through his guts. Was this where the Weapons of Mass Salvation were stored? He again murmured a soft prayer.\n#\nJack O Crumpet\u2015the figure seen by Brother Finnes scrambling along the ramparts of the facility known as Fort Helix\u2015was also scanning the landscape, but instead was cursing, not praying. Furious, he had just finished a phone conversation with Ilkie, the driver--handler of a truck convoy--solar cells burnt out--broken down in the desert. Though the hermetically sealed life support freak pods\u2013Ilkie had quickly informed him\u2015were being charged by emergency power, still there was a danger that the weird meat might die in the heat.\nBugger! If there were a delay in production, his name would be dirt among The Brethren\u2015a loss of reputation made only worse by the loss of commissions. A hired project contractor for these bloody holy rollers\u2015whom he secretly detested\u2015he managed the genetic re-processing of (generally innocuous) transspecies into a savage army of assassins\u2015part of this religious community\u2019s battle against the unfaithful and the evil.\nJack O\u2015not interested a bit in holy crusades\u2015was looking only for efficiency because it meant quick cash, not victory over evil. How fast can the production lab convert harmless, freaks into heartless monsters? At Jack O\u2019s suggestion, the Brethren had set up production quotas: four killer freaks guaranteed per month counting the entire process from genetic re-processing to re-education to weapons training and final graduating exams. In fact, his wages plus commissions for meeting last month\u2019s production quotas should be sweet, he thought happily.\nAt the pleasant thought of easy money, Jack-O sidled, as quickly as his deformed foot would allow, toward the Fort\u2019s main gate where he could watch hopefully for the arrival of the shipment. Ignoring the sleeping guard Frood, whose slack, drooling jaw, piggish eyes and fawning chit-chat he detested, Jack-O slipped by the sentry hut and down to the edge of the stockade: he squinted through the spy-hole at the vast desert salt flats shimmering in the heat like an ocean of sparkling bone.\nAs a child, living in small towns on this desert\u2019s fringes, he had been haunted by the stories bush scouts often told of this wilderness. All manner of monsters lived here, according to the old tales: nomadic tribes of gaunt, gibbering, fanged Aboriginals, mobs of huge, shaggy-black killer kangaroos. Horrors supposedly lurked everywhere: travelers torn to shreds by vicious packs of Dingo Dogs, bands of multi-eyed religious crazies wandering in search of God and human flesh, lone monks, living in caves, waiting to snare and disembowel lone monks from other religious sects.\nWho could say for sure? Most scientific exploration of the Australian interior had ceased years ago so it was impossible to know if these stories were even half-true. During his rare travels, his convoy always clung to the tracks running to the distant urban east, protected on either side by a no-man\u2019s \u2013land of concrete barriers and barbed wire\u2026\nTraveling is what he wanted to do again, get the hell out of this eternal hell forever. Once he had copped enough bloody cash, he\u2019d put this waste land behind him, go back to Sydney, and buy a nice little piece of frontage in Neutral Bay along with a comfort woman, maybe a sexy freak with huge tits . . .\nHeavy, rasping breathing startled Jack O out of his daydreams of avarice and sex. Peeps the hunchback, newly promoted to his aide-de-camp, stood goggling his eyes, signing and heaving, apparently the creature\u2018s way of saying that he felt neglected and unimportant despite in recent promotion. Jack O smiled: Ok, he thought, Peeps mate, have I got a job for you. Then he whispered, \u201cPeeps, organize some of the dwarfs into a team, get them out there into the Bush . . . find the convoy and its weird meat . . . I\u2019m losin\u2019 money the longer they're out there.\u201d\nPuffing up his chest, the hunchback then dashed here and there like a mad rooster waving his stubby fingers. He bellowed: \u201cBust \u2018er hump boys . . . Hey Dango get da water bottles . . . You Frut go to da supply room \u2018n fetch da jump starter kit and soler \u2018sells . . . Also Thedo fetch der tow hooks . . . May need to pull the busted truck back \u2018ere in order to save bloody Ilkie and the freaks. You Twirdle drive da sand wagon out \u2018ere.\u201d\nExtremely tall for a dwarf, Twirdle scurried into the Fort\u2019s garage, and backed out the seven-foot auto-console of smoothly welded scrap metal, bobbing on old tractor tires. Twirdle clashed the gears noisily as his scrambling team mates leapt aboard with jugs of water, crates of replacement solar cells and coils of hauling cable and hooks. Spinning the rear wheels, Twirdle sped toward Fort Helix\u2019s opened gate, almost losing Dango who clung trembling to Thedo and Frut.\nRoaring through the flat terrain, the sand wagon sprayed showers of bone-like grit. Twirdle glanced at his land sonar dial for sand traps or obstructions ahead. His crew, popping on sunglasses, had finally strapped themselves into the rear compartments and seemed content, despite their nervous breathing. Scorching winds raged about them like invisible flames.\nAfter about 25 kilometers, Twirdle noticed little dust plumes on the horizon and pointed. \u201cFrut,\u201d he yelled, you \u2018n the boys use yer bi-scopes to check what dar is`on doze flats is.\u201d Twirdle heard frightened squeaks. Thedo\u2015spying Brother Finnes and his halted expedition, spectral and floating on the horizon\u2019s shimmering heat\u2015cried out, \u201cCaptin, I think it be\u2019s The Pilgrims!\u201d\nHell\u2019s bells, thought Twirdle, those foul poisoned toads are back in the neighborhood. About a year ago, they had come to Fort Helix demanding dwarfs, sex, narco and money. When Jack O Crumpet told them to piss off, their nutty leader Credo threatened the Fort, telling Jack O that his mob had weapons of mass destruction left over from the Old Days that \u201cwould cream the whole lot of them (meaning the Fort) into mush that even a hungry buzzard wouldn\u2019t eat.\u201d Nothing had come of the threats, and they had left.\nTwirdle knew the shadow of Satanic Powers when he saw them. For, even though barred from a vocation within the Brethren\u2019s ranks\u2015even half-dwarfs were considered spiritually inferior\u2015he had managed to peek at snippets of various sacred texts that a helpful servant occasionally smuggled out of the prayer rooms. The Pilgrims were repeatedly condemned in these texts as \u201cbearers of The Devil\u2019s Night Soil,\u201d and the \u201cUnspeakable Servants of Darkness.\u201d The same texts also recounted blood-curdling stories of raids, replete with dwarf stealing, rape and other atrocities committed by The Pilgrims, including the sacramental consumption of both human and multigenetic flesh.\nApparently, the demented Pilgrims labored under the twisted belief that their band of outcasts was destined to create, through intergenetic mating and cannibalism, a new super-race, forged from the bodies and minds of both normals and freaks\u2015a \u201chealing\u201d process ushering in a new era of harmony between species. In other words, fucking and eating flesh would lead to world peace. The Fort Helix Brethren, who had foresworn all forms of sex except the occasional, furtive act of masturbation, dismissed these ravings as mere criminal insanity and spiritual disease.\n#\nBrother Finnes had nervously watched the approach of the sand wagon, swarming with vicious looking dwarfs. A Pilgrim spy mission? Or worse yet maybe an impending Pilgrim suicide attack. His expedition could be in immediate danger.\nIn his library, Brother Finnes possessed a tattered plastic-sealed document found by fellow monks while hunting in the wilderness near the Order\u2019s monastic grounds. Apparently, left by accident near a camp site used by The Pilgrims, it was some kind of religious rant; he now recalled its chilling words, a credible direct threat against the Order by the Pilgrims:\nThis world burns with the hot stink of spiritual corruption. Only a greater fire than the apostasy of our times can destroy this rotting corpse that fuels the flames of evil. In annihilation lies purification. Total destruction leads to rebirth. The blessings of mass salvation are thus bestowed through the weapons of mass destruction.\nAll those who oppose the sacred beliefs of The Pilgrims are worms and maggots. Foremost among these parasites is The Order of the Holy Community and its agents, acolytes and operatives; only the divine sword of The Pilgrims can slaughter these infidel wretches . . .\nBrother Finnes bellowed: \u201cMy children, blast those little messengers of evil\u2015they\u2019re Pilgrim scum of the desert, tools of Satan himself . . .\u201d Brumby and Albert ordered the other scouts to fire their lasers. They scored a direct hit, the sand wagon exploding into flames, hurtling the shrieking dwarfs into the air like little blazing balls; it was now, God willing, up to the sand and the wind to give these unholy terrorists a proper burial.\nGrabbing his cello-phone, Brother Finnes rang Brother Andrews: \u201cWe have destroyed a mob of satanic dwarfs trying to attack us. Also there is a fort about 35 kilometers from here . . . I think we have discovered the Pilgrims and where their weapons of mass salvation are hidden . . .\"\nBrother Andrews\u2019s voice trembled with awe: \u201cI feel the spirit of the Divine in your words, Brother.\u201d Ecstatic, Brother Andrews sensed the exciting birth of a warrior in his fellow beloved monk\u2019s soul. Was this shy holy man, an endless idler in his cloistered library, leaving comfortable theological meditations for dangerous spiritual actions? And high time, too. The Order was getting decadent and soft\u2015he self-consciously touched his own ample girth\u2015and a new crusade to energize the faithful and unfaithful alike was way overdue. Too long had his brethren just drifted along, going through the motions of verbally denouncing evildoers but never taking actual risks in the War against Satanic Terror. Brother Finnes was finally showing the way. He would lead them bravely to the Weapons of Mass Salvation, purifying the world of the ungodly. Brother Andrews whispered a fearful prayer: the End of Days may be at hand. Protect us. Save our souls, O Lord. Amen.\n|\n|\n______\n|\n||\n|\n______","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}

Campbell\nThis morning, I found the building I live in spray-painted with colorful, cryptic messages: gang signs. I could only stare at them in disbelief. Gangs today aren\u2019t what they used to be. Not even close. Carol Rodgers, a lady that lives in my building, was outside in her nightgown going completely hysterical. I told her she had nothing to worry about, and I meant it. In fact, waking up to that sloppy, red paint almost made me feel good. I knew it would wash right off. When I first heard crazy, old Carol screaming in the hallway about gangsters and whatnot, I instinctively shot up in bed; that word awakened and alerted every fiber of my being to the most urgent promise of danger. But sometime after rocketing out of bed, clumsily kicking my feet into my slippers, and rushing toward the door, I remembered that it was no longer the Roaring '20s.\nThe kind of gangsters I imagined had mostly faded out by now, along with speakeasies and silent movies. Sure, we\u2019ve still got gangs, but you'll have to excuse me if I don't run and hide at the sight of some minor vandalism. Don\u2019t get me wrong. Urban street gangs and the mafia are huge problems, but nothing can compare to the unstoppable machine of organized crime in the early decades of the 20th century. The 1920s and '30s gangster -- now that is something to fear. Believe me, I know. I was one of them. My brother Leo and I both had gotten into organized crime at an early age. Our elevator ride into the underworld makes an interesting story, but I\u2019ll reserve that for another time and place. This is the story of how I got out of organized crime and how I devoted my life to fighting it, along with dangerous criminals of all types, organized or not. This is my story. Me, Vincent Centuori. Gangbuster.\n#\nDEATH WORKS LIKE GANGBUSTERS\n#\nIt was early October, and our empire of crime towered high above Kansas City, rising far above the cops\u2019 heads, untouchable in the clouds. Figuratively speaking, of course. But just as you would imagine the life of a man who lived in a castle in the clouds, mine was equally good, or so I thought. I believed I was happy for awhile, but the ugly truth was that those clouds were storm clouds, dark and ominous. They continuously rained down on the city and its people, drowning their hopes and dreams and casting a cold, black fog over everything. It took me too long to see this. I was partly enshrouded in the fog myself, and by the time it had cleared, and I had shot my mouth off to everyone, it was too late. The others in the establishment didn\u2019t want to hear another word out of me. What we did was never questioned. I could almost see a cold night\u2019s slumber with the fishes hinted at in their eyes.\nThen one night in our warehouse, it was eerily still, not the usual cigar smoke-filled hangout, where we laughed and counted our money. This night was dead quiet, and there was only enough light for me to occasionally spot shadows of my fellow crooks creeping around. A clandestine meeting was taking place in the office. I could hear their hushed voices. I edged in closer, hovering in the darkness. I felt like a little boy who overhears his parents talking about him and suddenly realizes the seriousness of their discussion.\nOut of the little room, I heard a familiar voice say, \u201cDay after tomorrow, that\u2019s when I\u2019ll do it.\u201d The voice was from Sammy \u201cOne Gun\u201d Getty, and it didn\u2019t take much guessing to figure out what he was going to do and who he was going to do it to. Knowing when you\u2019ll be killed is an advantage most people never have. I also knew with what. Sammy was called \u201cOne Gun\u201d for a reason: he actually only had one, and I knew where he kept it. Everyone did. He never carried it on him unless he was going to whack somebody. So, I formulated a plan. One that didn\u2019t leave much room for failure, but was all I had. It went beyond temporarily saving my own life. After all, if I\u2019d wanted to skip town in the middle of the night with my wife and kid, fleeing to the far end of the world, I could have. But that wasn\u2019t my style, and it was no way to live. My plan was deeper and more complex, but I had to work fast.\nI knew a friend that worked in a new ammunition plant in Cape City, where they were making blank rounds for the talkies out in Hollywood. I was able to get my hands on a few. The night before I was supposed to be offed, I sneaked into our warehouse when the boys were doing business elsewhere. Except, I didn't plan on my brother being there. He had stayed behind, sleeping off his drunk. I told him I had forgotten my hat. He rose up on the couch, his black hair wild and his eyes bloodshot. We were twins, indistinguishable to everyone who didn\u2019t know us well (and sometimes to those who did). He seemed distraught, like he\u2019d just woken up in hell. He didn't say anything, just stared at me. I could tell he wanted to tell me something, though. It was itching at him, but he wouldn't let it out.\nI casually walked around the corner, out of his line of site and found Sammy's loaded gun (under his \"whacky hat,\u201d an oversized novelty in the Mad Hatter fashion) and replaced the bullets with blanks. When I came back, my brother was still sitting up on the couch, looking like a confused toddler who just woke up from a nap. Then he started to cry. I came closer to him, if only to see if it was true that a Centuori could cry. He suddenly grabbed me by my shirt collar and pulled me next to his beet-red face, still criss-crossed with lines matching the pattern on the couch. His breath was thick with bootleg.\nHe finally spoke, \"They're gonna whack you, Vincent.\" I told him that I already knew. Then he wiped his eyes as fast as he could, as if each tear was acid on his face. He sighed and slouched over, lost in thought. I could see a great weight had been lifted from his shoulders, and I almost felt like I should have told him my plan. But I didn't. He was too deep in the world I\u2019d be leaving tomorrow. When I left that life, I would leave him, too. He was lost.\n\u201cI found my hat,\u201d I said as I walked toward the door. \u201cBy the way, how\u2019s that new Tommy of yours?\u201d\n\u201cWorks like gangbusters!\u201d he said. I was just about out the door, when, from behind me, I heard the tatatat of that gun and saw the final, sober slump of my brother on the couch. He was lost, but he found a way out. I wanted a better way out.\n#\nA SCARECROW IN THE FIELD\n#\nThe next day, I found myself riding in the back of a car with Sammy and a couple of his bozo cronies.\n\"Yeah, Tony said to meet out here in the middle o\u2019 all these fields,\u201d Sammy said. \u201cCan you believe that? In the fuckin' fields, Vincent.\" Sammy was always a bad liar.\n\"Hey, Vincent,\" said one of the bozos, leaning back. \"Where's your brother? He was supposed to meet us for breakfast.\"\nSammy answered for me, \"Hey, you know Leo. Probably got sloshed and slept in some alley. You never know where that guy's gonna pass out. Hell, he could be sleepin' out here for all we know. You hear that, Vincent? Your drunken brother's passed out in the middle o' these fields like a scarecrow!\"\nThis all got heavy laughter from the others, but it sputtered out abruptly as we turned onto a gravel road. We traveled about half of a mile in silence, except for the terrible, bone-crunching noise of the tires grinding against the rocks. Then the car suddenly stopped, and we all got out.\n\"Tony says to meet him out here,\" Sammy said as he pointed to the middle of a great field. How stupid did he think I was? Or maybe he just didn't care. I led the way, crushing through the autumn grass. I could feel the rest of the gangsters\u2019 eyes burning a hole in my back. Just when I thought we had walked for a hellish eternity, I heard Sammy finally say, \"This is far enough.\" I turned around and saw that Sammy already had his gun out, pointed at me. He was giggling as he put on his \u201cwhacky hat.\u201d I always thought that hat was his desperate way of making murder fun and easy, as if the hat protected his emotions. Or maybe he just liked the mercury buzz. \"Ho, ho, it's whackin' time,\" Sammy chuckled.\nHe narrowed his already squinty eyes, aimed the gun at my chest (never in the face; it was the rules. At least they gave me that much), and fired. I cried out and gripped my chest, at the same time splashing blood (my brother's blood) over my shirt. Then I fell over dead. He was none the wiser. I was dead to them, dead to organized crime, dead to everything...except vengeance.\nBut that would come later. Right then, my only concern was being dead. I knew my plan wasn't foolproof. It was only a matter of time before Sammy figured out the bullets in his gun were kind of screwy, but it would be enough time to hide out and think of what I was going to do next. I thought the least I could do was leave them a body. That night, I went back to the field and laid my brother down where his blood had already stained the grass. They were right; my brother was sleeping out in the fields...like a scarecrow.\nOver the next few days, I hid out in old warehouses. Memories of my brother kept haunting me. I couldn't get his last words out of my head: \"Works like gangbusters.\" I called a few people I trusted to see if anybody had caught on to my trick, but I shouldn\u2019t have worried. Word on the street was that Sammy and his gang had gotten on the wrong side of a shootout with an Irish gang. Sammy and his boys got shot up like Swiss cheese and dumped into the Missouri River. That's the last anyone ever saw of Sammy \u201cOne Gun\u201d Getty.\nAfter that, I decided to pack up and leave town. I took Leo's Tommy gun and left my past behind me. Started over new. I found myself in Cape City, a fresh, booming metropolis whose black clouds weren't as thick as in some of the other cities. But it would happen sooner or later. My job was to make that later, or never, if possible. I had seen first-hand what organized crime did to a city, to democracy itself, and I was determined to cripple it at all costs. That\u2019s when, remembering my brother\u2019s dying words, I started calling myself \u201cGangbuster.\u201d\nAs it turned out, I wasn\u2019t alone. There were a few of us starting to surface here and there: superheroes. That's what they called us. But we didn\u2019t see ourselves as superheroes. We didn\u2019t even see ourselves as heroes. We were just crazy people who had snapped under the weight of out-of-control crime. There wasn\u2019t a single one of us whose eyes didn\u2019t reveal a touch of madness. It was the media and the people who labeled us as heroes. They only knew what they saw and felt. The time was right for superheroes. It was a crazy time that called for crazy people. I teamed up with a few of them every once and awhile, including Speakeasy Sasquatch, Fast Finger Freddy, and the original Skyscraper. We had our fun, and I'd like to think we made a difference. I\u2019d like to think the dark clouds above the city were thinning.\n#\nFOSSILS FROM THE PAST\n#\nFor many years, I brought down villains and busted up gangs. Being a costumed crime fighter had become a normal way of life for me. I dressed as I always had: a charcoal-gray, pinstriped suit and a fedora. But I also added an eye-mask to hide my identity. Together with my Tommy gun, a host of hi-tech gadgetry, and some key contacts on the inside, I usually managed to stay one step ahead of the gangsters.\nNothing came as a bigger shock to me, though, then the day when I learned from a contact that Sammy hadn\u2019t been the one who ordered my death back in Kansas City. He was just a pawn, but being the scum that he was, he eagerly went along with it. The real double-crosser had been my closest confidant and trusted partner, Lorenzo Draconi. I still can\u2019t believe it to this day, but it was true. By the time I learned this, Lorenzo, like me, had moved his base of operations to Cape City, where he got cozy with the arms manufacturers that were popping up all over that town.\nHe no longer went by the name Lorenzo, but was calling himself \u201cFossil\u201d. Apparently, he\u2019d started to identify himself as a super-villain, which he undoubtedly was in every way. One day, when he was doing some business at a factory (ironically, in the same place that had manufactured the blanks that saved my life years earlier), the place \"accidentally\" caught fire, and the whole thing blew sky-high. It was a terrible disaster, killing hundreds. Lorenzo survived, but was horribly deformed from the neck up.\nThe story goes that soon after the explosion, his right-hand man, Jimmy Jesky, when seeing his boss for the first time, said, \"Geez, Boss! You look like some kinda fossil from, like, the Jurassic times.\" They say Lorenzo was so infuriated by this remark that he stabbed Jesky 123 times and threw him into Lake Inferior, where -- who knows? -- someday millions of years from now, Jimmy Jesky himself might become a fossil. As hard as Lorenzo fought it, the name stuck, and he eventually learned to accept Fossil as his sole identity. Like me, Lorenzo Draconi was dead, and Cape City would from then on fear the name of Fossil. And indeed they did!\nIn time, Fossil would become my arch-nemesis. We fought hard for many years with some victories and failures on both sides. He didn't know that I was actually Vincent Centuori, come back from the dead. He just hated Gangbuster. Shortly after the stock market crash in '29, we had our final battle. I remember it like it was yesterday. The whole country had come apart at the seams, and Fossil, disturbed as he was before, was now categorically mad. He and his loyal army of thugs broke into the Cape City Museum of Natural History and started shooting up the place, killing people left and right.\nSkyscraper and I were on the scene the minute we got the call. The place was already surrounded by police cars, and Detective-Captain Max McGurk flapped his mouth and waved his tin in our faces, but eventually let us through. He knew this wasn't his fight. Within seconds of entering the museum, I unclogged some goons' pores, while Skyscraper slapped some skulls together. He was easily the tallest man on the planet, towering over 9 feet high. And like most giants not of fable, his height was a result of an overactive growth hormone, and he suffered from health problems. But not as much as villains did when they got in his way. He had fists the size of kettlebells and could intimidate anything that was considered alive. Probably anything that wasn't alive as well (bullets often seemed to turn tail in midair).\n\u201cI'll get this floor; you take the second,\u201d I said. The former circus sideshow freak nodded and lumbered up the stairs, shaking several displays with each step. He was almost at home among the colossal dinosaur skeletons haunting the museum. Fossil, however, had already kicked his shoes off and was calling them family.\nWhen I found him, he was bruising up some gal who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. A mounted Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton reigned over him and his henchmen. More than any other dinosaur, Fossil resembled T-rex, suited up in dark tweed. His eyes peered out angrily at me from deep hollows and then, moving that muzzle of his, he sicked his boys on me. I mowed through them pretty quick, avoiding their bullets by sacrificing a petrified tortoise shell, which seemed fit for a shield.\n\u201cDrop the Tommy,\u201d said Fossil, poking the poor lady's face with his own gun's barrel.\n\u201cYou need help,\u201d I said.\nA smile tore across his leathery face and revealed a wide chasm of splintery teeth. \u201cI need help not laughing at your idiocy. I can't be cured, Gangbuster. If you had lived my kind of life, you would understand.\u201d\n\u201cI believe a man can be rehabilitated, Lorenzo.\u201d\n\u201cThat's name calling! And it's not fair unless you tell me yours. Now, drop the gun and slide it over.\u201d I did like he told me and kicked my gun across the linoleum. \u201cAttaboy!\u201d he said. \u201cNow I'm going to kill the g --\u201d But he must of seen my brother's initials that had been scratched onto his old Tommy gun.\nThe T-rex skeleton started shaking; a bullet must have loosened it up during the last gunfight. Before it came crashing down, the gal had time to run to safety, as did Fossil. Had he wanted to. He just stood there staring at me, and I think he finally knew who I was. He didn't move, and the complete skeletal structure collapsed and showered bones down on him. He was smothered and crushed, and he died instantly.\nI left Leo's gun buried with Lorenzo and joined Skyscraper on the second floor. He had already pounded the remaining goons, and they were piled together in a giant heap, waiting for the cops. We walked out the door with a dozen or so rescued citizens, happy we hadn't become Fossil fuel.\n#\nNEW THREATS FOR NEW DEALS\n#\nThroughout the '30s, as America continued to sink into the Depression, I continued my crusade against crime, both organized and unorganized. Murder and corruption were still rampant, but I felt better knowing I was doing something about it.\nAt that time, the man whose name everyone knew and feared was Baron Khan. The baron was not just a threat to Cape City; he was a threat to the whole world. Not a single animal, mineral, or vegetable was safe as long as he was out there. And as much as I hated to admit it, he was out of my league. Besides, by now, there were superheroes galore. Some with superpowers so amazing, so awesome, that it made the rest of us feel like small children who wanted to help out, but just got in the way.\nMore super-villains came too. Ones with equally staggering powers. I knew my place and let the big boys, like The Crimson Fist, handle most of them.\nSomeone like The Frog was more on my level. He was someone that I could fight and still feel I was accomplishing something. In fact, he was sort of a petty criminal caught up in the super-villain mentality, who never would have amounted to much without Baron Khan. The baron supplied The Frog with an experimental nerve gas, which he used to kill nearly 300 people on the new Hi-Lo mass transit system in 1935. So, in a way, I was fighting Baron Khan.\nThe last time I saw The Frog, he had just pulled off a daytime jewelery heist. I spotted him hurriedly toddling down an alley on his flippers, toting a jingling pillowcase. When he saw me, he leaped at least 30 feet into the air and landed on a rooftop. All I had was a hookshot. I fired it into the sky and was whizzed up within seconds. As I struggled to unhinge the hook, The Frog was already making his way towards another building. I dashed across the roof and tried to tackle him, but his slippery wetsuit prototype made it impossible to get a grip.\n\u201cThis is none of your beeswax, Gangbuster!\u201d he shouted and then hopped onto the next building's rooftop, which was several feet taller. I managed to yank the pillowcase full of stolen jewelery away from him as he flew up, but the effect was similar to what happens when one tug-of-war opponent suddenly lets go of his side of the rope. I tumbled backwards and through a skylight, landing in the attic's insulation. Then, like pink cotton candy quicksand, it swallowed me whole. I sunk down, crashing through the ceiling and onto the ground floor.\nRunning out the building's front door, I tried to follow The Frog's rooftop retreat from streets below. I saw a green shimmer streak across the sky, onto the Swann Hotel. Unfortunately, my hookshot wasn't long enough to reach the roof, so I was forced to take the building's elevator. Rushing past a frightened porter, I ordered the operator to take me to the top floor. From there, I darted up the stairs, shedding fiberglass, and burst through the door to the roof.\nThe Frog was still there, finishing putting on his new rebreather gear. He saw me, and once again, took off. I knew he was headed for Lake Inferior, and I knew that if he was allowed to reach it, I didn't have a snowball's chance in hell of capturing him. As he bounded away onto the top of the Farqwater building, I shot my hook, hitting him, but it didn't catch. After firing again, I latched on to a gargoyle, which didn't look very happy to be my anchor, but stood sturdy long enough for me to eventually be reeled up.\nOn the roof, The Frog was stumbling around like he'd had one martini too many. My only guess is that when I fired my hookshot at him, it had hit the regulator of his rebreather, messing up the mixture of oxygen and whatever breathing gas he was using.\n\u201cGo away, Bang Guster!\u201d he slurred out, his voice unnaturally low. He made his way to the edge and dizzily contemplated diving into the lake, over 100 feet below. \u201cThass nothin' I...can do that.\u201c\n\u201cYou'll die,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI showed you to shut up, Gangbanger!\u201d He pointed his little peashooter gun at me and fired, missing wildly. I could have shot him then, but I felt sorry for him and felt I was in no immediate danger. \u201cGraybadger...heheheh...iz 'at your name? Hey! You kinda look like a gray badger. Hey...badgersss...don't wear hats!\u201d He eyed the lake again.\n\u201cDon't do it, Frog.\u201d\n\u201cS'nothin',\u201d he said and then awkwardly stumbled off the roof's edge, his body tousling in the wind as he fell. Near the end, he sort of formed a half-assed diving position before he slammed into the frigid water. He was never heard from again. Although he most likely died as a result of the fall, or not being able to swim in his mental state, some people still credit it as the work of Natiakah, Cape City's very own lake monster.\nAfter the decade came to a close, and the depression began to end, World War 2 suddenly ignited, and hysteria spread like wildfire. The world became preoccupied, watching the flames in the distance, wondering when we too would plunge into the inferno. All over the city, everywhere you turned, people\u2019s faces would be masked behind the black and white of the papers, but their expressions were clearly spelled out in the headlines. And when America sent her boys overseas, the term \u201csuperhero\u201d suddenly seemed facetious. Here they were vaunting around with their self-proclaimed, ostentatious titles, while normal people with normal names, like Jonathon McDonald and Charles Arnold, were being shipped off to the most dangerous and noble of all causes. The crazy people that had blossomed two decades earlier into a roaring chaos to be worshiped like gods were now seen as pests or threats to the order America so desperately sought. The popularity of the superhero had nose-dived to just above a German-speaking Jap.\nIt was then, in the early '40s, that I decided to call it quits. Not because I got caught up in the anti-superhero fervor of the time, or I had stopped believing, but because, quit frankly, I was getting old. And it wasn\u2019t just physically either. Everything about me was antiquated. Younger, more modern superheroes with superhuman strength and other abilities were beating me to the action. After the National Firearms Act of 1934, it got harder and harder to get my hands on Thompson submachine guns and doing so made me feel like just another criminal. This was all part of the changing times; people tried to forget the violent decades that preceded them and looked to a more civilized future. I too was tired of all the violence and war and wanted nothing more than to hang my hat up and finally let my knuckles heal.\n#\nMY TWO CENTS\u2019 WORTH\n#\nWhenever I was asked my name as a child, I always gave the same witty reply: \u201cVincent Centuori, and that\u2019s my two cents.\u201d If they got it, they usually laughed. But as I got older and became a troubled adolescent, it became sort of an inside joke for those who knew me. It was ironic, because I never had a \u201ctwo cents\u2019 worth\u201d about anything. I never had a strong opinion, never had anything to stand behind and believe in. It was because I didn\u2019t care. So it is with more great irony that I should find myself, today, telling this story. Not only would I make my opinions known, but I realized that I actually stood for something; I was a symbol of my beliefs during the more than two decades I fought crime. As I put on my eye-mask for the first time and stepped out onto the grimy streets of Cape City, I finally had something to believe in.\nThis afternoon I took a walk down Main Street. I don\u2019t get around as well as I used to, but I still like to walk the streets of this city I\u2019ve come to call home. It turned out to be a rainy day; the sun was trapped behind a thick layer of dark clouds and gloom hovered in the air like stale smoke. But I had come to see something I hadn\u2019t seen in a long time: an 8-foot statue of me, erected in 1977. It stands at the southeastern end of Pavilion Park on Main and Rank Avenue, downtown. I don\u2019t know why, but it was just something I needed to see. Maybe because I look so proud in that statue, hands pressed firmly on hips, projecting such a youthful confidence that I\u2019ve lost over the years. That\u2019s what I had come for, I guess.\nI sat down on a park bench next to the statue and just stared at it through the rain. It too had been covered in gang signs (you don\u2019t think a gang would pass up trashing a statue of some old-timer called Gangbuster do you?), but they weren\u2019t recent and had started to fade. As I was looking at them, I noticed something that I had forgotten all about. Walking over to the statue, I saw the shiny, metal plaque at its base. The rain had washed away all the bird droppings and had pushed the vines away. I now could read the words:\nGangbuster\nAn original Cape City hero whose tireless campaign\nagainst organized crime helped keep the city safe and realize its dreams\nI don\u2019t know how long I stood there looking at that plaque, but when I finally looked up, I noticed that it had stopped raining. I gazed up into the sky and saw that the sun had finally broken free. The dark clouds had thinned out and, at last, dissipated altogether. And I knew I truly had made a difference.\n|\n|\n______\n|\n||\n|\n______","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}

After she\u2019d had an affair with a Spanish waiter he\u2019d wiped any archived memories and left the rest on scratch to be recorded over with tomorrow's sunset. She bounded up to him and threw her arms in an encircling embrace.\n\u201cMartin, Martin, it\u2019s so good to see you. How are you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know who you are.\u201d Martin stood statue still waiting for the hug to loosen, a look of bemusement on his face.\n\u201cMartin, it\u2019s me. Don\u2019t tell me. Oh please. You didn\u2019t archive our time together? What about all the good times? I\u2019ve never deleted you from my favourites list and I keep some of the best times in head all the time. And here,\u201d Sevet pulled her purse out of the bag she was carrying and removed a small memory card. \u201dThis is the whole year, never far from my heart.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know you. Please, I have to go.\u201d Martin tried to move around Sevet.\n\u201cNo, Martin, please, please just remember this,\u201d she held up the card. \u201cPlease.\u201d Martin\u2019s mother had always told him never to take memories from strangers, you never knew where they\u2019d got them from, and yet he felt compelled to do so. He wasn\u2019t torn for long and he reached out to take the card from an emotional Sevet. He jacked in his MemoryMan and inserted the card. It all came rushing back at once, the joy, the pain, the love. He copied the card to scratch, losing most of the day in the process, he needed more time to remember. He sat on the floor and started crying. He remembered it all now.\n#\nMartin and Sevet sat opposite each other in a small cafe off the main town square. The cafe was crowded and noisy, giving each table a semblance of privacy despite the close proximity to other people. Martin gazed out of the window they were sat beside, watching the lunchtime crowds cross the square.\n\u201cSo tell me, Martin, how are you?\u201d\nMartin turned back to to face Sevet, \u201cI was okay until today. I\u2019d forgotten you, I was fine.\u201d He left the implication hanging. Seeing Sevet, rather remembering Sevet, had thrown his world into disarray. He remembered her long dark hair, her deep blue eyes, her smile. It was too much.\n\u201cHow are things at work, Martin?\u201d\n\u201cOh okay,\u201d his mood seemed to lighten at the mention of work. \u201cI\u2019m doing fewer hours now, just three days a week.\u201d\n\u201cI find that hard to believe,\u201d Sevet smiled and the smile was reciprocated by Martin.\n\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m the chairman now; I can take a back seat knowing that the hard work has been done.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you miss it? How do you manage working just three days a week?\u201d\n\u201cI manage okay, the shares have just kept going up so I don\u2019t have to worry about money anymore. The company has three hundred employees now.\u201d\n\u201cWow!\u201d Sevet looked surprised. \u201cA bit of a change from a three man band in a garden shed. It must feel great\u201d\n\u201cWell it\u2019s more important to me that we\u2019ve done something worthwhile, although it\u2019s easy for me to say that. Money is just the means to the end and not the end. We\u2019ve helped a lot of people, and I feel good about that.\u201d Sevet smiled and sipped her coffee. \u201cI made the top ten most powerful men in the world.\u201d Martin laughed at Sevet\u2019s shocked face.\n\u201cReally? Wow, Martin, that\u2019s fantastic.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t take the media stuff too seriously.\u201d\nSevet smiled and then gently let her expression turn more serious. \u201cMartin, don\u2019t you think that we deserve another chance?\u201d She reached out for his hands which were entwined around a mug of tea. He removed them from her touch and looked up out of his mug into her eyes.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d His mood sank back to the lowest depths. \u201cAfter you and that guy. Why should I even speak to you again?\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the good times though, Martin? They were so good.\u201d\nMartin started as a realisation suddenly dawned on him. \u201cHold on a minute, how did you get hold of my memories?\u201d His voice raised in volume as he said this and Sevet nervously glanced around to see if anyone was looking. Martin had suddenly realised that the memories on the card she had given him were his, not hers. It hadn\u2019t occurred to him before as it was so natural, he would have been startled if the memories were Sevet's, not his.\n\u201cMartin, calm down, listen,\u201d she reached out for his hand again, \u201dI can explain. It\u2019s quite embarrassing, it\u2019s just that, well...\u201d Sevet seemed to flush, her cheeks turning red. \u201cI used to enjoy your memories from when we made love, I used to like watching myself...\u201d\n\u201cSo how did you get the memories then, Sevet? How did you manage to extract them from my head exactly?\u201d Martin's look was piercing, not even loved ones stole memories.\n\u201cI used to download them while you were asleep. I\u2019m sorry, I just couldn\u2019t tell you, it was too embarrassing.\u201d\n\u201cThere was obviously a lot of understanding in our relationship. A lot of trust. A lot of love. How could you do it, Sevet?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Martin; please forgive me.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Sevet, it\u2019s too late. Relationships end for a reason, we\u2019re not meant to be together. I wish I could say that it was nice remembering you. Goodbye.\u201d He rose from the table and headed from the caf\u00e9 door.\n\u201cMartin, please.\u201d Sevet was trying not to shout but she still had gained the attention of most of the caf\u00e9, \u201cMartin,\u201d she was pleading now.\nMartin glanced back at her. \u201cGoodbye, Sevet.\u201d He headed out the door, hoping that this time it was for good.\n#\nMartin awoke to the sound of curtains being opened and the warm feel of sunlight drifting into the bedroom. With his eyes still closed he reached out to his left only to feel an empty bed.\n\u201cWakey wakey, lazy bones, breakfast.\u201d Her voice was over by the window. He kept his eyes closed, letting the smell of bacon drift into the bedroom and give his body that little extra wake up kick. He heard her move to the the bedside and place a cup down. Coffee, he could smell it. Suddenly Martin reached the state of awake and his brain kicked in with the reminder that he should be doing something. He opened his eyes and was greeted by a smiling Sevet in her dressing gown. She sat down beside him and stroked his hair.\n\u201cI should be at work, what time is it?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s nine thirty, a lovely sunny Sunday morning. Why don\u2019t we go for a walk along the beach?\u201d\nMartin gazed out of the window at the azure blue sky, he could just hear the seagulls crying outside.\n\u201cNo, sorry, I\u2019ve really got to work, we\u2019re so close now I can feel it.\u201d\n\u201cMartin, please, I hardly see you these days. We\u2019ve got lots to sort out as well, bills are unpaid, the life assurance is up.\u201d\n\u201cI thought I told you to pay the bills?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you before, I don\u2019t have the money in my account and I can\u2019t pay it from yours. I really do think that we need a joint account.\u201d\n\u201cLook, Sevet, all this can wait but my work can\u2019t. The virus is spreading fast, people are getting worse, if we don\u2019t crack it soon no one will remember that we owe bills.\u201d Martin was sitting up in bed now, fully alert.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that a bit melodramatic, Martin? A few people have it, so what?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Sevet, no. We can\u2019t think like that. The virus spreads so fast and we don\u2019t even know the mechanism. The search for a cure has been hopeless so far, it could take years to come up with a vaccine. In the meantime we have to come up with a work around. We\u2019ve got to try and give these people back some normality.\u201d\n\u201cNormality!\u201d Sevet laughed as she stood up. \u201cNormality! Do you call storing your memories in some computer normal?\u201d\n\u201cSevet, you\u2019re simplifying things again, it\u2019s not a computer.\u201d\n\u201cWell, whatever, putting your memories in some black box is not normal as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d\n\u201cWould you rather have them unable to remember anything? Unable to function because they can't even remember their name, let alone how to make a cup of tea, or who they saw yesterday.\u201d Martin sighed and flopped back down onto the bed, they\u2019d had this argument a hundred times, and Sevet just didn\u2019t agree with him. He felt that she was such a product of their capitalist society, she never seemed to care about anyone else. Sevet knew what he was thinking.\n\u201cLook, Martin, if it was up to you we\u2019d still be living in a grotty flat saving up to get married. Look around you, Martin, look at this beautiful house, you get this by caring about yourself, not others.\u201d\n\u201cTell me then, Sevet, what happens when you lose your memory, who will look after you? Who will want to after all this time of looking after yourself? It\u2019s a state of mind, Sevet. A caring state of mind.\u201d\n\u201cWell perhaps you should just upload that state of mind into everyone then? Is that what you\u2019re after?\u201d\n\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d Martin sighed, he knew that it was no good trying to win this argument so he let the discussion drift away. \u201cAnyway, what were you saying about those bills?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, come on, lazy bones, let\u2019s go for a walk then open a new account for those bills.\u201d She smiled, letting the argument disappear without a trace.\n\u201cThen they haven\u2019t cut off the TV yet?\u201d Sevet reached down and hugged Martin.\n\u201cNo, they haven\u2019t cut us off just yet\u201d\nMartin got up and walked to the window. The blue sky reached down and kissed the horizon. The sea was calm and still, gently lapping the beach. The sun was bright and small, the glare of the sea made him squint. The gulls floated to the sea line pecking for food, and a man and his dog left footprints in the damp gold sand along the shoreline. He could see the footprints stretching back towards the lighthouse at the end of the bay. Yes, he thought, a walk would be nice.\n#\nHe knew that his name was Martin, but he didn\u2019t know his last name. He pulled his coat tightly around himself to try and keep out the draft. The underpass seemed to channel a breeze into a gust. Some warmth made its way to him from the nearby fire but not enough to stop his shivering. The road overhead kept the rain away from him, but the tarmac beneath was cold. He tried to wrap some of the cardboard boxes around himself to add some extra protection, glancing around at the other people nearby as he did so. There were about ten of them, some men, some women, all in dishevelled clothes, all trying to gather some warmth from the fire. He couldn\u2019t remember their names, somehow he felt that he should, but no one was aggressive towards him. Just then everyone started, looking out from beneath the underpass into the torrential rain beyond. Two figures were approaching, both carrying boxes. No one around him seemed to recognise them, he certainly didn\u2019t.\nThe figures reached the edge of the underpass and paused as they stepped out of the rain. They shook themselves to dislodge some of the water from their long raincoats, one of the men placed the box he was carrying on the floor and smoothed his hair back with one hand. He picked the box back up again and the two men continued. Martin couldn't hear the footsteps due to the roar of the traffic overhead. Within a minute, the men were a couple of metres away from him.\n\u201cHello, everybody,\u201d said one of the men. \u201cMy name\u2019s Grant, and this is Ricky, we\u2019re here to give you all some food.\u201d They opened the boxes and started passing out parcels to the dishevelled people.\n\u201cHello, Martin,\u201d said the man who called himself Grant. Martin jumped with shock.\n\u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d\n\u201cWe met last week Martin.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t I remember you then?\u201d\nThe man called Ricky sighed loudly, \u201cGrant, do we have to go through this conversation every week?\u201d\n\u201cYes Ricky, have patience.\u201d\n\u201cLook Grant, I\u2019m not here because I feel sorry for these guys like you. I\u2019m here because some judge said I had to be. That same judge said that if I didn\u2019t do my community service, I\u2019d end up with a tag and just a day's headspace, okay?\u201d\nGrant turned back to Martin, \u201cSorry, he gets a bit irate. Still, he\u2019ll learn in time. Fancy some shepherds pie?\u201d Grant produced a foil container from within one of the brown boxes, steam was rising from it. He pulled off the lid revealing a golden brown pie and handed it to Martin with a fork. \u201cTuck in.\u201d\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t I remember, Grant?\u201d Martin looked at Grant and then ate a mouthful of the pie.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t remember because your headspace isn\u2019t big enough, and you don\u2019t have an external system.\u201d\nMartin looked up from the pie, \u201cWhat\u2019s headspace?\u201d\n\u201cWell, headspace is like RAM in your head. Sorry, let me try again, headspace is the hardware in your head that stores your memories. It\u2019s like a bottle, and the memories are like wine\u2014it can hold so much, and then it overflows, and that\u2019s when you forget.\u201d\n\u201cBut I can remember yesterday, Grant, and the day before.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re very lucky, Martin, I\u2019d keep quiet about that. Most of these people have no headspace at all. You must have a pretty nifty amount of hardware in there to remember that much without an external system.\u201d He tapped Martin\u2019s head making him flinch.\n\u201cWhat about you, then, how much headspace do you have?\u201d\n\u201cOh, not much, I\u2019m afraid that social workers don\u2019t get paid an awful lot,\u201d Grant smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s why I have this.\u201d He held up a small black box which he had taken out of his pocket, \u201cIt interfaces by this socket,\u201d he pulled back his hair to reveal a lead physically plugged into a socket in his head. \u201cNot very elegant, or very cool, but cheap.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do we need these things, Grant? It feels strange needing these things.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s because of the virus.\u201d Grant looked down at the floor, sighed, then looked back at Martin smiling. \u201cEnough of this depressing talk Martin, how are you? Have you thought about trying to get a job? Then you could get a cheap system, save some money, get some more headspace. What do you think?\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember you. I can\u2019t remember ever thinking about getting a job.\u201d\n\u201cI gave you a piece of paper, Martin, it had details of what to do.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t have it.\u201d Martin held the hot pie in one hand and patted his pockets with the other. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have it.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay, here\u2019s another one,\u201d Grant handed Martin a piece of paper. \u201cIt has instructions on how to get a job, and why you should want to. Follow the instructions, and go to the address, they'll help you to get a job. Okay?\u201d\nMartin read the piece of paper quickly, \u201cUh yeah, okay.\u201d\n\u201cGrant.\u201d Ricky was stamping his feet with his hands deep in his pockets. \u201cCome on Grant, we'll never get the rounds in before lunch.\u201d\n\u201cComing, Ricky,\u201d Grant turned back to Martin, \u201dTake care Martin, I have to go now, try and remember about that job, really try.\u201d Grant stood up and looked down at Martin. \u201cTry. For yourself. Goodbye.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, Grant, goodbye.\u201d Martin watched Grant walk away puzzled by the emotion in Grant's plea. He could just hear Ricky talk to Grant above the roar of the traffic and the rain.\n\u201cWhy do you care so much Grant? They\u2019re just no-spacers.\u201d\n\u201cBecause I know how it feels, Ricky, I used to be one of them.\u201d\nMartin watched the two men step into the rain and disappear into the distance, then he looked down at the piece of paper and read the title again, \u201cIMPORTANT. PLEASE TRY TO REMEMBER.\u201d\n#\nMartin looked down at the piece of paper in his hand and then back up at the street sign, both said New Street. He continued to walk down New Street closely watching the numbers on the shop fronts. The crowds had thinned somewhat as the street was heading out of the town centre. He\u2019d made it through the centre okay, but the sheer number of people made him nervous, now he was feeling much calmer. He read the piece of paper again, \u201cGo to the following address and ask for a job. A job will enable you to buy a cheap system and remember more. Try to remember this. The address is Jobs4Everyone, 45 New Street. When you get there ask for Dave Terry, he'll look after you.\u201d\nMartin sighed and continued looking for number forty five. Then he saw the sign Jobs4Everyone just past the caf\u00e9 with the tables in the street. The street was pedestrianised so people passing through walked in the middle of the street, and many of them seemed to do this to avoid Martin. He arrived at the door of the Job shop, straightened his coat and looked at his reflection. Martin knew that he didn\u2019t look like the other people around here, he had a straggly beard, unkempt hair, and his clothes were dirty, but this was the only way that he could ever remember looking. He entered the shop and approached the man sitting behind the desk. The man, whose name badge read Gordon, looked up from the screen that he was staring intently at.\n\u201cYes?\u201d Gordon's tone was contemptuous.\n\u201cHello,\u201d Martin glanced nervously at the piece of paper. \u201cI\u2019ve come for a job.\u201d\n\u201cI see. Have you filled in the necessary forms?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I...I\u2019m supposed to see this man,\u201d Martin handed the piece of paper to Gordon, which he read and then stood up.\n\u201cOne moment, I'll fetch Dave.\u201d\nGordon walked through the door at the back of the office. Martin could hear two people talking but couldn't make out what they were actually saying. Eventually Gordon emerged with another man.\n\u201cHello, I\u2019m Dave. Pleased to meet you.\u201d Dave extended his hand towards Martin and Martin reached out to shake it instinctively. \u201cI see you haven't forgotten everything then. Right let\u2019s see if we can find you a job, Martin, and you can start saving for some headspace,\u201d Dave smiled at Martin. \u201cPlease sit down,\u201d he gestured to the chair by the front side of the desk. \u201cFirst of all, can you tell me anything about yourself?\u201d\n\u201cI know that my name is Martin. I\u2019ve come from beneath a road some way away.\u201d\n\u201cI see, and why did you decide to come here today?\u201d\n\u201cI found that piece of paper this morning so I did what it said. I want to be able to remember more.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, first of we\u2019ll grab a retina scan to see if you\u2019re on record and then we need you to do a test to see what type of job we can get you. Okay?\u201d Martin nodded and Dave produced a black box the size of a fist from the drawer in his desk. \u201cLook into this, Martin, that\u2019s it, lovely.\u201d Dave plugged the box into a socket in the desk and clicked a button. \u201cRight, while that\u2019s doing a search for you I\u2019ll take you into the back room to start the test.\u201d\nMartin was starting to feel a little overwhelmed but the compassion in Dave's face stopped him panicking. Martin was lead through the door into the back office and told to sit at a desk with a screen.\n\u201cThe screen will tell you what to do, Martin, it\u2019s a touch screen so you can just push your finger against the screen like this.\u201d Dave touched the screen and the Jobs4Everyone logo disappeared to be replaced with the words \u201cAptitude Test\u201d.\n\u201cOkay, Martin, I\u2019ll let you get on with it, call if you need anything.\u201d\n\u201cYep, fine, okay.\u201d Martin read the screen and started the test, deciding which shape fitted which pattern, which word means which description and a variety of mathematical problems, none of which Martin struggled with, all the answers came to him instinctively. Martin lost track of the time and engrossed himself in the test. He started when the door opened and in walked Dave with a uniformed man.\n\u201cMartin, you can stop the test now, this man wants to talk to you.\u201d\n\u201cOh, okay, Dave, I haven\u2019t quite finished yet though.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay, Martin, this is more important.\u201d\n\u201cMartin,\u201d the uniformed man stepped forward. \u201cMy name is Detective Julian Gomez, I work in the memory crime division of the police.\u201d\nMartin smiled at the man, \u201cHello, how can I help you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I have some bad news for you.\u201d The policeman looked down at his feet awkwardly.\n\u201cBad news?\u201d Martin could only think that he wasn\u2019t being allowed a job. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\nThe policeman looked back up at him, \u201cI\u2019m afraid, sir, that you\u2019ve been hijacked.\u201d\n#\nMartin rose from the sofa to answer the door, it was Detective Gomez.\n\u201cGood morning, Detective, do come in, would you like some coffee?\u201d\n\u201cHello, Martin, good morning, no coffee for me thank you. I\u2019ve come round to bring you something back,\u201d Martin raised his eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019ve got your memories, Martin.\u201d He offered the black plastic briefcase he was holding. Martin opened it to reveal at least a hundred memory cards, all neatly stacked and encased in hard foam.\n\u201cWell, Detective, I\u2019m speechless, thank you. Where did you find them?\u201d\n\u201cThey were in her apartment, not too bright a criminal, I\u2019m glad to say.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but she was clever enough to suck me in to start with.\u201d\n\u201cNothing to be ashamed of, we reckon that this is the third hijacking she\u2019s committed in two years. It\u2019s just that you\u2019re a bit too high profile to go unnoticed. I\u2019m afraid that we had to scan the memories for any evidence but the detectives will be wiped once we\u2019ve concluded the case.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Detective, I understand. Did you find anything?\u201d\n\u201cI think that we\u2019ve got enough to convict her, we\u2019re still going through her memories, and that should give us some more. Has anyone filled you in on what happened? What can you remember?\u201d\n\u201cWell, since your guys released the block on my headspace I can remember meeting Sevet, or whatever her name was, opening our joint account, then nothing until I was living underneath the overpass and then getting picked up by you.\u201d\n\u201cYou can count yourself lucky Martin, we\u2019ve seen people who have had their headspace surgically removed, not just blocked programmatically. We\u2019re still after the guy who hacked your headspace, he was definitely a pro.\u201d\n\u201cThe thing that confuses me Detective is how she managed to get those memories of me and her when I\u2019d never met her before?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that there\u2019s some clever people out there. If you\u2019d have had time to dwell on them then you might have realised that they were someone else's memories, but all of them rushing back into your head at once, you just can\u2019t cope. What about your company? Any damage done?\u201d\n\u201cWell, we may have lost some ideas, but all the shares and money are recoverable.\u201d Martin leaned back against the sofa and let a smile cross his lips.\n\u201cSomething funny, Martin?\u201d\n\u201cSorry Detective, I was just remembering something. We take it so much for granted, but when you lose it for a while it\u2019s so joyous remembering.\u201d\n\u201cRight, well, I think I'll leave you to it then, I'll see myself out.\u201d The Detective stood up to leave, moved to the door and turned back to look at Martin. \u201cOh and next time Martin, don\u2019t take memories from strangers.\u201d\n#\nMartin woke to the sunlight streaming through the curtains and the sound of gulls crying over the background noise of the surf washing against the shore. He rolled over onto his back and slowly opened his eyes, blinking in the bright light, then swung out of the bed and shuffled to the window, parting the curtains. He watched the sunlight glinting off the surf and remembered the good times spent walking down there on the beach. Squinting against the sun to see the lighthouse, he remembered the bad times spent arguing in it\u2019s glass dome. Martin smiled, oh to remember.\n|\n|\n______\n|\n||\n|\n______","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}

First run in the Martian Olympics of 2240, the race commemorates the famous run of Anatolia Shrlenko who outpaced Terran ops to warn Martian forces of an impending attack.\nRITUAL\nIt looked like a marble, a fuzzy marble that changed colors before your eyes. Or maybe it was just that he began to notice that there was color there, an orangey-pink, where seconds before he saw only white. And then the polar cap appeared like a lopsided beanie and a darkish area grew in the middle. Perhaps more features would have appeared, like the Valles Marineris or the grand canals themselves, had there been more time, but after ten seconds, the fuzzy pink marble passed quietly out of the eyepiece and Eric\u2019s turn at Lowell\u2019s eighteen-inch reflecting telescope was over.\nOn the long drive home, Eric was quiet and thoughtful. \u201cDad,\u201d he began. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d\n\u201cWhat was what, son?\u201d\n\u201cWhat was that thing I saw in the telescope?\u201d\nMarcus smiled. \u201cThat was Mars, son.\u201d\n\u201cMars?\u201d Eric echoed incredulously, his six year-old mind unable to connect the massive red planet that he had seen on the posters outside the observatory with the little pink dot in the telescope. They\u2019d waited in line for three hours and stayed up until two in the morning to see a pink dot in an old telescope. It didn\u2019t seem to make sense.\n\u201cWhy did we come here?\u201d\n\u201cTo see Mars.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I know, but\u2026\u201d Eric yawned. \u201c\u2026couldn\u2019t we see it on TV?\u201d\n\u201cI wanted you to see where you were going. I wanted you to see it with your own eyes so that you would know that it was real.\u201d\nIt was the last and clearest memory Eric had of being on Earth with his father. The only other memories were vague impressions like half remembered dreams.\nSHOCK\nWhy the Martian Marathon is 2.5 times longer than the standard Terran Marathon has as much to do with the theoretical limits of human athletic performance as it does to do with geography. As Martian gravity is 40% or two-fifths that of Earth, the theoretical gain in sports performance is 2.5 times. High jumpers on Mars can jump 2.5 times higher than jumpers on Earth, 6.23 m being the current Martian record. Martian baseball players can hit 2.5 times farther, or about 700 meters, even more with a corked bat. It follows, then, that a Martian marathoner should be able to complete 65 miles on Mars in the same amount of time that it takes a Terran marathoner to complete 26 miles on Earth. Nothing, however, could be further from the truth.\n\u201cMom,\u201d Eric began heedless of the soy chunks still in his mouth, \u201cwhy is Mars smaller than Earth?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why it\u2019s smaller. It just is. Why do you ask such questions?\u201d\nEric thought for a moment and then began to cry. \u201cMars should be bigger than Earth.\u201d Eric was crying a lot lately, crying because the sky was pink instead of blue, crying because there were two small moons instead of one big one, crying because he couldn\u2019t see his father anymore.\nAnatolia shook her head and made a tsk tsk noise. Then she got up and began to rinse the ceramics. She looked out the window. \u201cMars may be smaller than Earth, but its days are longer.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I know, but not much longer. Only thirty-eight minutes.\u201d Eric wiped his tears.\n\u201cAnd its year is almost twice as long as an Earth year.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cAnd its mountains are much bigger. Olympus Mons is three times bigger than the biggest mountain on Earth.\u201d\nEric was clapping his hands and giggling. \u201cHurrah for Mars!\u201d\n\u201cYou think that\u2019s something? That\u2019s nothing compared to this.\u201d Anatolia wiped her hands on the dish towel and pulled back the kitchen curtains. \u201cYou see that?\u201d\nEric ran to the window and looked outside.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the biggest hole in the solar system. It\u2019s bigger than the Grand Canyon. It\u2019s bigger than all Earth\u2019s valleys put together, and we live right in the middle of it.\u201d\nEric stared at the towering red cliffs of the Valles Marineris and walls of Red Town far in the distance. It was a view he had seen every day for the past two years, but now he saw it with new eyes and he felt something he had never felt before; he felt pride, red Martian pride.\n\u201cWow!\u201d\nDENIAL\nIf a sprinter on Earth can run one hundred meters in 9.25 sec, as Arelios Franchetti did in 2180, then he should be able to run 250 meters on Mars in the same time or better, except that he can\u2019t. The best Martian 250- meter-sprint to date is still over ten seconds. Similarly, the Terran marathoner, Luke Xia Zulu, should have been able to run a Martian Marathon in 1:56:43, the same time it took him to run the 26 miles and 385 yards from Marathon to Athens in the 2238 Olympic Games, except that, he can\u2019t, or couldn\u2019t. In fact, in the inaugural 2240 Martian Olympics, this Terran favorite would have finished in just over three hours, far behind the pack, if he hadn\u2019t walked off the course midway, vowing never to run on Mars again.\nAnatolia was waiting for her husband at their usual rendezvous, a lonely stretch of road just outside of the Martian city of Carter. She\u2019d been waiting for over an hour, and her sense of panic was growing with every minute. She knew something was wrong, and that she should leave, get out of there before it was too late, but she could not. It had been over a month since she\u2019d seen her husband, and her heart longed for him.\nEight years ago, she had met Marcus Rideau at the Martian embassy on Earth. He was a handsome young officer and she quickly fell in love with him. Shortly thereafter, Anatolia bore him a child and the family lived together in quiet anonymity. But when political tensions erupted on Mars, Anatolia was recalled. Her marriage became a matter of the direst political sensitivity. She was a Martian ambassador, after all, and could not maintain relations with the enemy.\nReluctantly, she returned to Mars with her questioning six year-old son in tow. Unbeknown to her, Marcus enlisted in the Terran ops so that he could follow his wife to Mars, and for a while, they were able to arrange the occasional clandestine rendezvous and keep in secret contact. But now, something had gone wrong, and Marcus was late.\nThe rover\u2019s radio erupted in static and with a sigh of relief, Anatolia answered it. \u201cMarcus, where are you? What has happened?\u201d\n\u201cLeave, Anatolia, leave!\u201d The voice, although panicked and desperate, was undeniably her husband\u2019s.\n\u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re attacking! Leave immediately.\u201d\nAt that moment, as if to punctuate her husband\u2019s warning, an explosion shook the rover. Anatolia screamed. Out the rover\u2019s back window, she could see the city of Carter bursting into flames.\n\u201cAnatolia, are you there?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m still here.\u201d\n\u201cThey can track your rover and radio from orbit. You\u2019ll have to go on foot. Make for Red Town and run. Run faster than you\u2019ve ever run before.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Marcus.\u201d Anatolia was crying. \u201cWhat about our son?\u201d\n\u201cPlease, Ana. You must go now!\u201d The radio suddenly turned to static.\n\u201cMarcus! Marcus!\u201d Anatolia screamed into the rover\u2019s radio. She tried changing the frequencies, but it was no use. It was as if an invisible blanket of snow had fallen over the planet. If it was an invasion, the first thing the Terran forces would do would be to jam communications. Red Town would have no warning of the imminent attack. Her mind raced with a million thoughts at once. She had to make it to Red Town before them. She dropped the radio. She didn\u2019t remember leaving the rover, but she must have. She felt the heat of the burning city on her face. She took two steps into the forest before being thrown violently to the ground by another explosion. Anatolia looked back through the trees to see her rover consumed in flames. With tears in her eyes, she turned towards Red Town and ran.\nISOLATION\nMany factors may contribute to the discrepancy between the theoretical athletic performance and the actual performance of the Martian marathoner. The Martian atmosphere is not yet identical to Earth\u2019s. Average temperature is ten degrees lower, although some tropical low points, like the Valles Marineris, are quite comfortable. Air pressure is ten to fifty millibars less and carbon dioxide, oxygen and nitrogen levels seem to fluctuate daily. Martian dust, or fines, is also a factor, causing violent electrostatic storms and clogging airways and pores even at the microscopic level. Synthetic lung veils and dermablock creams, about as invasive as sun tan lotion, boast 100 % filtration, but runners are not entirely convinced. Apparently a century of terraforming and a Martian health care system next only to Sweden\u2019s, has not yet been enough to overcome four and half billion years of areology.\n\u201cWake up, Eric.\u201d\nIt was his father\u2019s voice, a voice he hadn\u2019t heard in over a month. Eric was immediately filled with joy. He struggled to wipe the sleep from his eyes. He was vaguely aware of voices in the distance and a bright, hot light outside his window. His father was carrying him into a helicopter. Eric saw the blades whirring above his head. Eric saw his dad turn to the pilot and say something. He seemed angry.\n\u201cDad?\u201d\n\u201cYes, son. It\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\u201cDad? I was dreaming.\u201d Eric yawned. \u201cI was dreaming I was back on Earth, living in our old house. But dad, I couldn\u2019t move. My legs, my arms, everything was so heavy and I was so weak. The kids made fun of me like they did when we came to Mars.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a dream. Nobody will make fun of you anymore. Try to go back to sleep if you can.\u201d Eric\u2019s dad seemed distracted. He kept calling mom\u2019s name into the radio, but there was no answer. Eric felt the helicopter lift off the ground and there was the sound of fire crackers outside.\n\u201cDad, where are we going? Where\u2019s mom?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to meet her. You\u2019ll see. Go back to sleep.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t. It\u2019s too noisy.\u201d\nMarcus turned back to the pilot. \u201cFly low over the Marineris and drop me about ten miles west of Red Town.\u201d\n\u201cLook, sir,\u201d the pilot called back over the sound of the whirring blades and the fire crackers, \u201cthis is highly irregular. We are way out of mission parameters here. If you continue in this course, I\u2019ll be forced to assume command and hold you under arrest.\u201d The pilot drew his pistol.\nMarcus knocked the pistol onto the floor with the butt of his rifle. The pistol went off harmlessly but deafeningly loud. \u201cBlast it, sergeant. How many scrapes have I pulled you out of? I\u2019m not asking you to give up your career. Just drop the boy off somewhere safe and forget you ever saw me.\u201d\n\u201cBut sir\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s my family, John. What wouldn\u2019t you do to save your family?\u201d\nThe pilot went silent. He nodded and the helicopter accelerated. Marcus looked back at his son. Eric was shaking from the night air. He couldn\u2019t help it. He felt his father wrap a silver blanket around him and hug him tight.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to leave in a minute or two,\u201d Marcus said into Eric\u2019s ear.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Sergeant Bolton is going to fly you to Burroughs, you remember, where aunty lives. She\u2019ll take care of you for a while. You\u2019ll have a little vacation with your cousins, ride their horses. You like that. And then mom and I will come get you.\u201d\n\u201cDad?\u201d\n\u201cYes, son.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a Terran from Earth.\u201d Eric could feel the warmth returning to his fingers and toes. \u201cAnd mom\u2019s Martian, but what am I? I was born on Earth, but I can\u2019t go back, and I\u2019m not Martian, not really, not like cousin Argyre and Hellaspontes. I\u2019m nothing.\u201d\nMarcus rocked his son gently. \u201cYou listen to me, son, just in case I don\u2019t get to tell you this again. You\u2019re Martian through and through. From the moment you stepped your bare foot out of that orbiting elevator into the red Martian soil, you belonged to Mars.\u201d\nEric smiled. A moment later, his father was gone and he was alone in the back of a cold helicopter.\nDESPAIR\nThe single most important factor for a Martian marathoner will always be gravity. The same 2.5 multiple that turns high jumpers and baseball players into supermen, turns marathoners into stumbling, awkward, uncoordinated fools. The frustrated Franchetti likened running on Mars to skating underwater. It just wasn\u2019t natural. Somehow, Martians were going to have to learn how to take this Olympian body, born and bred for millennia to run in one G, and turn it into a 0.4 G running machine. And this was going to take time, about a Martian century, in fact.\nFifty-three miles outside of Carter, about ten miles to Red Town, the Valles trail veered from the shore of the Marineris River to follow a dry creek bed next to the canyon wall. It was a lonely stretch, an ancient place where the evidence of the lifeless ages of Mars lay bare on the canyon walls exposed by mass wastage and intermittent periods of cataclysmic erosion. Just off the road, talus and river rock lay strewn together all around in a jumble of Noachian and Amazonian confusion. It was here that Anatolia found herself exhausted, bewildered and alone.\nShe was fighting the pain that had started in her lungs and had spread like cancer through every cell in her body. Having pushed herself beyond her limits, she faced doubt that she would ever make it to Red Town. She was a frightened animal that would run itself to death. She searched desperately for some last ounce of courage that could keep her going, but she could not find it.\nThere was a rustle in the bushes, and with a sigh of relief, Anatolia saw her husband emerge from the forest. He was fully dressed in Black ops regalia, complete with assault sniper rifle and stun grenades. It had always scared her seeing him dressed like that, and in her haunted dreams she had even seen him pull the trigger and kill. But she never asked him about it. Whatever he had done, she knew that he\u2019d done for her and for their son, to be with them as a family.\nAnatolia ran up to her husband and hugged him. \u201cMarcus, what\u2019s going on? What\u2019s happening?\u201d\nMarcus squeezed her even tighter, holding her breathless for a long moment, and then pushed away roughly. \u201cIt\u2019s the war, Ana. You must make it to Red Town. Run with everything you have left, and don\u2019t look back. I\u2019ll hold them off as long as I can.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I won\u2019t leave you.\u201d Anatolia clung onto Marcus with desperate strength. \u201cI can\u2019t do it, Marcus, not without you.\u201d\nMarcus tried to drag his wife away, but still she held on. \u201cAnatolia, there\u2019s no time. They\u2019re right behind me, a mile, maybe less. They can hit us from here.\u201d\nAnatolia buried her head in the slick poly-plastic of Marcus\u2019 armored chest. Marcus said nothing for several seconds. Gently, he held her head in his hands. At last, Anatolia surrendered to his gentle grip.\n\u201cAna, you must trust me. Eric will be safe in Burroughs with your sister. When this is all over, you can . . . we can go get him. But you must go now. Run to Red Town, and don\u2019t look back.\u201d\nAnatolia looked at her husband for the last time. There were tears in his eyes. Bravely, she turned again towards Red Town and ran.\nNot far behind her, she could hear the occasional sounds of gunfire. She wondered if one of those sharp blasts had come from her husband\u2019s sniper rifle and if the bullet had found its mark in the soft flesh of another human being. She shuddered at the thought, but then a more horrible thought struck her. What if they were hunting him now as they were hunting her? Surely they were. It did not matter that he was protecting the woman he loved. He was a traitor to his own people, to his own planet. They would find him and kill him, just as they would soon kill her.\nAnatolia felt a new strength well up from deep within her. It wasn\u2019t fear. It wasn\u2019t rage. She would never find a word for the feeling she had at that moment, but whatever it was, she would not stop running and she would not look back. This was a race that she simply had to win.\nAFFIRMATION\nDuring the rebellion of 2230, Carter was attacked by Terran special ops under cover of a Phoebus\u2019 eclipse, but one Martian woman, Anatolia Shrlenko, who had been out in her rover at the time of the attack, escaped. Abandoning her rover (which was fortunate as it was tracked by satellite and bombed minutes later), Anatolia began running due East along the Marineris River to the rebel controlled Red Town. It was also fortunate that Anatolia was such an accomplished Martian runner as she reached Red Town a full ten minutes before the Terran special ops, who were also on foot. As it was, the Terran forces were ambushed at Red Town, held for ransom and the rebellion played out largely as it is described in the history books \u2013 bloody, cruel, inevitable.\nThe train ride from Burroughs was long and boring \u2013 nothing to see but orange cliffs and the river. Eric\u2019s mom hardly said a word the whole trip. Eric had been on his cousin\u2019s horse when mother came to get him. He\u2019d been having fun. At first, he was happy to see her. He hugged her and kissed her like he always did, but he didn\u2019t really want to leave. He\u2019d been living with his cousins in Burroughs for nearly a year, and he liked it there. Aunty even said that she would buy him his own horse one day. And now mom was taking him away. It didn\u2019t seem fair. Eric put up a fuss, even started to cry. It wasn\u2019t until mom said they were going to see dad that he finally gave in. But that was more than two hours ago, and now he was tired and hungry, but mostly bored.\n\u201cAre we there yet?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re almost there, dear. Just a few more minutes.\u201d\nIt was a lie. The train didn\u2019t stop for a long time after that, and when it did, Eric suddenly realized he had to go to the bathroom.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go before when the train was moving? We have to get off now.\u201d Mother groaned and pulled on Eric\u2019s arm so hard he thought it would come off. \u201cCome on.\u201d She struggled through the crowded train of exiting passengers and Eric thought of the salmon he\u2019d seen swimming the wrong way up the Marineris River. They were like two salmon, he and his mother. He wished dad was with them. He could push his way right through that crowd of strangers. Eric had never seen his father do anything like that, but he knew he could.\nFinally, they reached the back of the train car, but just as mother was opening the bathroom door, a man in a bright blue uniform and hat stopped her.\n\u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am, but all passengers must now exit the train.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand. My son really has to use the bathroom. He\u2019ll only be a minute.\u201d\nThe man stepped in front of the door. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s impossible. This train runs on a tight schedule. If we\u2019re late in Red Town, we\u2019ll be late all the way down the Marineris Line. You\u2019re son will have to wait until he gets through the term\u2014\u201c All at once, the man stopped talking. His face became strange and he was looking straight at Eric\u2019s mother as if she were Santa Claus.\n\u201cI beg your pardon. Are you . . .? Are you Anatolia Shrlenko?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d mother said simply.\nThe man suddenly looked much smaller than he had a moment ago. He put his hands together as if he were about to pray. \u201cPlease accept my sincerest apologies.\u201d\nMother motioned towards the bathroom door. \u201cCan he . . . ?\u201d\n\u201cOh, of course. And don\u2019t worry about a thing.\u201d The man pressed the communicator button on the wall. \u201cI\u2019m calling the engineer right now. He\u2019ll hold the train.\u201d\nEric went into the bathroom, but he could still hear the man in blue talking to his mother outside. \u201cYou take all the time you need. I\u2019ll call down the line and tell them we\u2019ll be a little late. Can I get somebody to take your bags? Here, let me take that.\u201d\nEric\u2019s mother never said anything about the incident as they walked through the train terminal into Red Town. She acted as if the whole thing was pretty much normal, and so Eric took it to be just so. However, he did wonder how the man in blue knew his mother\u2019s name. Did the man know his father too?\nLater that afternoon, after they\u2019d dropped off Eric\u2019s bags in the rust-colored apartment that was to be his new home, Eric and his mother took a taxi to a large stadium in the middle of town. He\u2019d already asked his mother a dozen times when they were going to see dad. She always answered with the same lie: \u201cWe\u2019ll see him soon, dear.\u201d But now when he asked her, she said nothing. There were tears in her eyes.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, mommy?\u201d Eric took his mother\u2019s hand.\nAnatolia went down on one knee and looked into her son\u2019s eyes. He was crying too, although he didn\u2019t know why.\n\u201cI wanted to show you something, Eric. I wanted to try to explain something to you, but now I don\u2019t think I can.\u201d She wiped her eyes with the back of her hand. \u201cYour father . . . the man who was your father died while saving my life and yours.\u201d\n\u201cNo, mommy.\u201d Eric wanted to argue with his mother, but he was crying so hard that he couldn\u2019t speak. His mother hugged him tightly.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, dear. I wanted to tell you before, but there was so much suffering. I just couldn\u2019t bear it. I should have told you a long time ago. I\u2019m so sorry, baby.\u201d\n\u201cNo, mommy.\u201d Eric found his voice at last. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, mommy. I love you.\u201d They cried together for a long time after that, and then Anatolia brought her son to a memorial statue in front of the stadium. There stood his father, the soldier, cast in solid iron forged from the iron mines of Red Town. The plaque beneath told his story \u2013 the story of a Terran traitor, and a Martian hero.\nRENEWAL\nRitual, shock, denial, isolation, despair, affirmation \u2013 these are the first six stages of a marathon. The seventh and final stage is renewal, without which no great human undertaking, whether national or personal, has any meaning. Mars is currently undergoing a cultural revolution of sorts, boycotting Terran Corporation products, forming new Martian political parties. Some are calling it the second rebellion, but it is hard to nail down what they are rebelling against. There is no violence, yet, and no overt lawlessness. There haven\u2019t even been any significant demonstrations. It is almost as if a few Martians have rediscovered some latent gene of self-control and are telepathically transmitting it to the rest of the Martian population. There is very little the Terran multinationals and their puppet governments can do about it. After all, if a Martian suddenly decides that he can go through life without the latest fashion or gadget from Earth, there\u2019s no law that says he has to buy it.\nThe Martians waited for the sunrise that would strike into the Valles Marineris like dragon fire. They waited, as they had done hundreds of times, for the behemoth gecko to peak its massive eye over the Valles wall and lick the red Martian rocks with light. They never spoke in the timeless pause before dawn \u2013 a silent ritual chiseled from ten long years of Martian planetary conflict, but the runners\u2019 minds raced with jumbled anticipation.\nIn moments, Eric would be running again. His breathing would regulate and his pores would break into a gentle sweat. He would pass like an insect by fifty-foot boulders and thousand-foot rock arches that jutted from the canyon wall. He would run over grassy wildflower meadows and through pockets of pine forest. Another twenty minutes of hard running and he would reach the rocky shore of the Marineris River and the torrential noise of ninety thousand tons of flowing water. Here the trail followed the man-made Martian waterway for fifty miles as it pounded relentlessly through the gaping wound in the side of Mars, the only real Martian canal visible from Earth.\nDeep into the heart of Mars his paces would take him, rhythmic sandy footfalls, undulating over the same dusty red trail his mother had run a decade ago. In the final leg, the route would veer from the river to the canyon wall and time would stop until the walls of Red Town would spring up to greet him. He would enter the New Tyrr Stadium with its polyfab walls nano-dyed in rustic Martian red, and the sound of the spectators would be deafening, unlike anything that had ever filled an arena, hippodrome or Olympic stadium on Earth. It would be as if the entire Valles Marineris, all 3500 kilometers of it, were a colossal, natural amphitheater broadcasting the epic contest to the four corners of the Martian globe. This was the Martian Marathon, the most famous stretch of red dust on Mars and the most important annual event on the face of the planet.\nAs he waited in the shadow of the canyon wall, he thought again of the personal tragedy that had spawned a new culture, a new nation, a new world. He thought of his parents \u2013 two ordinary people who wanted nothing more than to live a quiet life with the ones they loved. He thought of the hopes and dreams of the thousands of others that had died since them, and the final peace that was forged in their blood. He knew in that moment that it was worth it. It was all worth it.\nThere was a flash as bright as lightning, and dragon fire burst out upon the canyon walls, painting the darkness with luscious, golden color, and descending in seconds to the green valley and raging Marineris below \u2013 a drop of nearly four vertical miles. This was the awesome power of the Martian sublime that dwarfed anything seen on Earth. This was what got Eric up at four in the morning, what gave him the strength of mind and body, gave him the faith that a world could be made and that he could make it. This was what made him one with Mars. He stood on hallowed ground, and he was not alone.\n|\n|\n______\n|\n||\n|\n______","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}

The Leutnant used a leather truncheon to lift his chin.\n\"Waars jou pass, jong?\" he growled in Amerikaans.\nWelcome to the VSA, thought Chadwick.\nThe Leutnant repeated his question in English.\n\"Where's your pass, boy?\"\nThe Pass Laws were an important way the white minority regime controlled the Coloreds--the formal term the government used was Negroes, or Zwartzen in Amerikaans--by requiring them to live in the squalid outlying shantytowns. You needed a pass to prove you had a job, and a reason, to be in the white man's city.\nChadwick realized the customs agents were eyeing him warily. He turned to see his suitcase propped open. One agent was flipping through his passport, while another pawed through his belongings.\n\"You've come a long way, Mynheer Chadwick. How are things in Whitewaters Ridge?\"\nHe took the passport from the agent's hand. \"It was only 34 degrees when I left Whits last night. So actually, July in New\nAmsterdam is quite pleasant. Thank you.\"\nHe carried his bag through the revolving doors. The Leutnant shoved the young Colored man ahead of him down the corridor of Van der Jagt International Airport.\nTwo Colored men leaned on brooms and watched the show in front of the rest rooms marked \"Blankes\/Zwarzten\".\n\"Just another day in the VSA,\" he heard one mutter bitterly.\nA dark green Checker cab pulled to the curb. Chadwick slid into the back seat.\nHe looked up and saw how the cabby peered at him in the rear view mirror. Cabbies in New Amsterdam took pride in being able to tell whether they needed to address a fare in English or Amerikaans.\n\"Waarte, mynheer?\"\n\"Manhattan, please, the Bosh Platz Hotel.\"\nThe cabby winced.\n\"I'm very tired, I just flew 16 hours from South Africa on the BOAC, so don't be surprised if I doze off.\"\nHe saw from the cabby's body language--the way he sat up slightly--the light bulb had lit up when he realized his fare was from South Africa.\nChadwick's mother was a VanDeMerwe, so he was half Afrikaner. In South Africa, the English and the Dutch, as well as all other European and African races, got along well.\n\"Not like here,\" he thought as he leaned back and began to doze off.\n#\nHe awoke as the cab was made its way through midtown Manhattan. It was dusk and colored lights had come on atop the Vrystat Building that towered over 34th Street.\nLike everything else in the bilingual country, the hotel bore two names: Bosh Platz for the Amerikaners--Park Plaza for the Anglophones.\nThe desk clerk addressed him in English as he pulled up his reservation. \"Mr. Patrick Chadwick, in again from Whitewaters Ridge. It's a pleasure to have you back, sir.\"\nA Colored porter wheeled his bag to the room on the park side of the hotel. Chadwick tipped him a shiny silver VSA thaler.\nThe hotel overlooked the irregularly shaped Stuyvesant Park that lay in the center of Manhattan. It presented a pleasant landscape from the balcony outside his room.\n\"Just like the whole country,\" he thought, \"looks nice at first glance. But underneath . . .\"\nHe checked himself mentally. \"Cripes, I'm beginning to sound like a sanctions fanatic.\"\nHe stared a long time across the city skyline before he went inside and to bed.\n#\nThe Anglo-African Gold Company's office in New Amsterdam was in the middle of Manhattan's financial district.\nA sea of gray heads greeted Chadwick. Most of the directors from the North American offices were older than he was.\nThe directors from the other major North American offices--Chicagueux in Louisiana and DeLosAngeles in California, Canada, the Confederacy, Tejas, Deseret--were respectfully on time.\nNo gamesmanship today, he thought.\nAs an officer of the corporation, Chadwick took the place of precedence at the head of the table. Bezuidenhout, who was the manager of the New Amsterdam office, looked awkward sitting off to one side.\n\"He knows what's coming,\" thought Chadwick as he cleared his throat and self-consciously stroked his hair, where, he recalled with a twinge, he had begun to find silver.\n\"You all know how hard we have striven to maintain cordial relations with the government of the Verenigde Staten van Amerika,\" he said--using the proper name in Amerikaans --\"despite worldwide opprobrium of the apartheid regime.\"\n\"It has been especially difficult these past 14 years, since the collapse of the Plantation Regime in the Confederacy, the tearing down of the Mason-Dixon Wall and the end of the Cold War.\u201d\n\"We all have been under a great deal of pressure in Whitewaters Ridge. During the administrations of Presidents Mandela, Mbeki and Hani, the subject of our investments in the VSA has been skirted with great difficulty.\"\n\"But President Biko is unwilling to turn a blind eye,\" he said as he leaned forward, \"and he has indicated that unless we withdraw our operations from the VSA, our corporation will become subject to legislative sanctions.\"\nThere were murmurings. Chadwick held up his hands. \"It is a fait accompli. The Anglo-African Gold Corporation is withdrawing from the VSA.\"\nHe looked down the table at Dane Alexander from the Confederacy.\n\"In appreciation of the great strides the CSA has made, we will be moving the North American headquarters down the coast to Savannah.\" Alexander nodded appreciatively.\nBezuidenhout spoke up. \"We still have the strongest and most secure economy in the hemisphere, from Philadelphia to Boston. I think the corporation is making a mistake in basing its decision on politics.\u201d\n\"Sorry, the VSA made its bed when it voted in the apartheid government in 1948,\" he said. \"Shit and pay is the Amerikaan way. Isn\u2019t that an Amerikaner expression?\u201d\nBezuidenhout rose without a further word and went to his office. The others were subdued as the meeting continued.\nAfter the formality of ratifying the decision, he spoke with each man as he left.\nBezuidenhout didn't seem surprised when Chadwick opened the door.\n\"May I come in?\"\n\"Of course, Patrick.\"\nThe younger man sat down.\n\"Conrad, this wasn't a big surprise, was it?\"\n\"No, of course not. It's just, like being in prison, and learning you've lost your last appeal.\"\n\"Sterkte, hoor?\" said Chadwick--an Amerikaans colloquialism meaning, \"Strength, hear?\"\nChadwick thought he saw a flicker of resentment cross Bezuidenhout's face.\n\"Do you have any good news for me, then?\"\n\"Obviously, we can't just forgo the gold trade in the VSA,\" said Chadwick. \"The largest banks in North America are all headquartered here. We plan to follow the same policy we have with Russia, and do business through intermediaries.\"\n\"A few key employees in South Africa plan will resign,\" he continued, \"and start their own company, which is going to take up the slack created by our withdrawal.\"\n\"I see,\" said Bezuidenhout as he folded his hands, \"and they will be needing a New Amsterdam rep.\"\n\"Quite. I think they will hope you would work for them.\"\n\"Let me think about it,\" said Bezuidenhout. \"I'm very close to retirement.\"\n\"I understand, and I certainly don't expect an answer today,\" said Chadwick.\nWhen Chadwick left the building he realized it wasn't even noon yet. He strolled down the block and stopped on the corner, where the bilingual sign read: \"Muur Strasse\/Wall Street\".\nHe focused on the colonial-era Dutch Reformed Church that stood at the head of the avenue.\nAlong the way he saw a Greek grocer off-loading vegetables. He slapped a Colored man in the face over some perceived incompetence.\nThe man accepted the blow meekly--seeing that a policeman stood on the corner.\nSick in a way, the way even other Europeans who come here end up acting like Boers, he thought, using the derogatory term for the Amerikaners the English in the VSA used behind their backs.\nWhen he got inside the kerk, he looked around.\n\"Baas has never been in the church before?\"\nChadwick turned to see a rather old and frail Colored sexton.\n\"Nein, mynheer, I'm a visitor from South Africa,\" he said, addressing him respectfully.\nThe old man's eyes brightened. \"Oh, blessings on Mandiba's head!\"\nChadwick had never heard anyone in the VSA mention the venerable Mandela, much less use his honorific--a tribal title of extreme respect.\nChadwick walked over to the sexton. \"I'm glad to know others respect him as much as we do.\"\n\"My name is Malcolm Little. I've worked here over 40 years.\"\nChadwick saw the man, though old and frail, had a spark in his eyes that shone from behind his thick glasses.\n\"Malcolm, pleased to make your acquaintance. My name's Pat--Pat Chadwick. I'm from Whitewaters Ridge.\"\n\"Would you like me to show you around?\" he asked. \"Not many people come in this time of day.\"\n\"I'd like that very much.\"\nThe sexton took Chadwick down the aisles and into the naves of the church, stopping at every historical marker.\nThe church was built in the early 18th century, he noted, as New Amsterdam prospered in the years after the English threat to the colony passed. Stubborn Governor \u201cPeg Leg Pete\u201d Stuyvesant rallied the burghers of New Amsterdam to repel the British landing in 1664, he chuckled.\nDespite his professed lack of formal education, Chadwick thought Malcolm knew his history quite well--how the American revolt against mad King George succeeded quickly because of the help of the Middle Atlantic Dutch colonies, and how almost 20 years later, when Napoleon overran the Netherlands, New Amsterdam joined the fledgling United States.\n\u201cYes, and the Brits got revenge for New Amsterdam\u2019s meddling by seizing the Dutch Cape Colony,\u201d said Chadwick.\n\u201cTo our great misfortune,\u201d said Malcolm. \u201cBecause after that the Dutch settlers stopped going to the Cape, and they all came to New Amsterdam.\u201d\nThe old fellow\u2019s sharp, thought Chadwick. \u201cBecause that\u2019s why the Boers came to dominate the old USA.\u201d\n\"We had a white minority government in South Africa, too, for a number years,\" he added.\n\"Yes, but there you have more English than Boers--the reverse of here,\" said Malcolm.\n\"I remember watching on black and white television when I was a boy as Mandela was sworn in as president,\" said Chadwick.\nThe old man smiled. \"That was the same year I started working here in the church--1960.\"\nHe suddenly looked rather self-conscious.\nChadwick patted him on the shoulder. \"Thanks for the history lesson.\"\n\"You're very welcome.\" He wagged a broomstick. \"Next time you come back, I'll put you to work!\"\nChadwick took a deep breath as he stepped outside, and then chuckled. The visit with the sexton had been like finding a violet growing in a dung heap, he thought as he hailed a cab to go back to the Bosh Platz.\n#\n\"Whatever we may think personally, the fact is, doing business with a polecat regime like the VSA is bad for business,\" Chadwick thought as the cab drove through mid-town traffic.\nHe looked at his watch and realized he was a little early for his meeting with Bezuidenhout. He asked the cab driver to drop him off at the head of Muur Strasse.\nHe entered the church. An elderly Amerikaner woman got up from the desk in a small side office.\n\"May I help you?\"\nHe looked around. \"I was looking for the sexton, Mr. Little?\"\n\"He's not here.\"\n\"That's a shame. When will he be back?\"\nThe woman looked equal parts embarrassed and irritated.\n\"He won't be back.\"\n\"Has he been sacked?\"\n\"Nien, he has been killed.\"\n\"What! I was just talking to him yesterday afternoon! What in God's name happened?\"\nThe old woman shook her head. \"I really don't know. He got in some kind of trouble with the police on his way home yesterday.\"\nHe looked at her, and she realized she couldn't get away without offering up something else.\n\"It was down in the tubes,\" she said. \"They went to check his pass and arrest him . . .\u201d\nChadwick was out the door and into the subway station. He bounded down the steps and strode to the first policemen he saw, who stood in the middle of the platform so he could watch both the white and Negro subway cars.\n\"Do you know anything about a old black man who was in a scuffle here last evening.\u201d\nThe policeman fixed his gaze and stared back at Chadwick. \"We arrest many Negroes here on any given day, sir,\" he said coolly in Amerikaans-accented English.\n\"He was the sexton at the church.\u201d\nChadwick saw a flash of recognition. \"Ach, I know who you mean. Old Malcolm.\"\nThe policeman took off his hat. \"I'm afraid the alte zwart liked to take a nip after he got out of work. One of our new men didn't know him, and began giving him grief over his pass. It wasn't in order.\"\nThe policeman grimaced. \"I think it was signed by President Roozevelt. They got in a big dust up, and somewhere old Mr. Little fell and hit his head. I'm afraid he got a big knot.\"\n\"He passed away?\"\n\"Ja, I heard he later died at the hospital. Shame, he was harmless.\"\n\"Who was the officer who accosted him?\"\n\"A new man, Danie Vanderpool. It was an accident, mynheer.\"\n\"It always is.\"\nAt this point, Chadwick remembered his meeting with Bezuidenhout. As he walked onto the block occupied by the Anglo-African Building, something caught the corner of his eye. He turned and saw a municipal policeman furtively come out a side door and go the opposite direction, down the alley and out the back of the building.\nHe could tell when he came to Bezuidenhout's office the old Amerikaner had been puffing furiously on those nasty Knickerbocker cigarettes the locals favored. The last butt was smoldering in the ashtray.\n\"We've investigated a lot of time and money trying to deal with the trade sanctions as best we could,\" said Chadwick. \"It's just not working any more. I know you understand.\"\n\"Ja, well, we're not going to go anywhere. We have as much as right to be here as the Zwartzen.\"\n\"I'd wager the Iroquois would toss you all back into the Atlantic.\"\nOld joke, but it still made Bezuidenhout grin self-consciously. He was uncomfortable with that, and he straightened his shoulders and began to hold forth like a Reformed Church dominee.\n\"We have a long history here, and we are proud of it. God gave us this land in the New World,\" he said, \"and we made a nation of it. The next time you're at the Muur Strasse kerk, you need to look at . . .\"\nHe saw something in Chadwick's eyes that made him stop.\n\"How in bloody hell did you know I visited the church?\"\nChadwick remembered the policeman he saw going down the alley.\n\"You bloody bastard, you had me followed! You Amerikaners are all thick as thieves. You had a chum in the police follow me, didn't you?\"\nBezuidenhout realized he had made a serious mistake, and he began to stammer. \"Patrick, we can't be too careful. I didn't know if they had gotten to you.\"\n\"They?\" He banged a fist on the desk. \"Who the hell are they?\n\"I didn't know if someone was filling your head with racial nonsense.\" Bezuidenhout's face had gone from white to translucent. \"That old man, at the church--he was a Black Panther sympathizer. You shouldn't listen to crazy zwarts like him!\"\n\"You fucking bastard! You had your hound Vanderpool follow me, and he overheard us talking in the church.\u201d\n\"It was an accident,\" Bezuidenhout said distantly. \"Danie got riled and followed him to the Tubes after work. One thing led to another...\"\n\"And Leutnant Vanderpool strikes a old black man who must be at least 70,\" said Chadwick. \"Just another day in the VSA, eh?\"\nHe made a violent gesture of dismissal that almost struck Bezuidenhout in the face. \"I'm getting the hell out of your New\nAmsterdam now, thank you.\"\nHe headed to the door. \"You're taking retirement immediately.\u201d\nBezuidenhout nodded feebly.\nBack on the street, Chadwick walked briskly as he punched up his cell phone and called his personal assistant.\n\"I'm heading out to the airport, Thomas. Have you been getting the incorporation documents ready for the dummy corporation?\"\n\"Yes, Mr. Chadwick.\"\n\"Don't. Throw them in the dustbin. There isn't going to be a dummy corporation.\"\n\"My goodness, Mr. Chadwick, what's changed?\"\n\"We're actually pulling out of the VSA. I'll tell you all about it when I get back.\"\nHe saw a Colored man sweeping out in front of a small shop. It was the same man he had seen struck on the street the day before. The grocer was standing in the doorway with his thumbs under his vest.\nHe saw the sidelong glance the Colored man gave the Greek.\n\"Things are a lot worse here than I ever imagined,\" he thought.\n\"It's only a matter of time before there's a blood bath.\"\nAs he walked to the curb to hail a cab, Chadwick looked up and down the busy avenue. The hustle and bustle of the financial district--as well as the people on the street--reminded him of the Whitewaters Ridge business district back home.\n\"Bloody damn fools,\" he muttered as he hailed a cab and looked around \u201cYou will lose this all. We have been so lucky in South Africa.\u201d\nLou Antonelli is a journalist by profession and began writing s-f in 2002.

I\u2019ve been told that all of my life. That\u2019s why I named my dog Science. At least I resisted the temptation to name a dog God, unlike some trainers I could mention.\nOh, I considered those genetically engineered dogs. And I thought long and hard about purebred clones. But I found Sci at the pound. There are still some things dogs can do that laboratories can\u2019t duplicate, like how to purposefully breed a retriever like Sci. And I\u2019ve got a feeling even the pound dogs won\u2019t be able to make another Sci.\nIn one sense, I\u2019m glad of it. Sci waits for just the right moment to jam his freezing cold nose onto bare skin. Doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m clipping my toenails, just about to sip a scalding hot cuppa or bending over to clean up Sci\u2019s poo. His patience is infinite. He waits longer than a starving cat at a mouse hole. Once a person\u2019s attention is distracted for an instant\u2014-BAM! I\u2019ve got a feeling that\u2019s why he ended up in the pound in the first place. I was told it was because of his hazardous farts, but I think it was really due to his habit of goosing everyone with that big freezing wet nose of his.\nBut the same nose he used for play he also used for work. He\u2019d hunt down a hypothesis faster than I go through a relationship. One mere whiff of a morphic field, and he\u2019d pounce on that lost idea\u2019s fading trail or die trying.\nI wish I could take the credit for discovering that dogs could smell ideas, but it wasn\u2019t me. The recently knighted Sir Reynard Delancy figured it out. Trust an Englishman to be blind about how to treat his fellow human being, but crack the code of canine communication. I doubt I would\u2019ve -\u2014 at least, that\u2019s what he kept telling me. He injected himself with dog blood. I kid you not. I highly doubt that changed his brain any, but he thought it would, and this placebo effect gave us the world\u2019s first idea retriever trainer. Absolute genius, total bastard to his lovers, but angelic to his dogs. I was unlucky to be his lover for about ten minutes. But I\u2019ve been under his shadow for most of my life.\nI\u2019ve been training idea retrievers for five years now. It\u2019s not steady money, but it keeps you on your toes\u2014-especially if a cold wet nose jams between them on a day you foolishly wear sandals.\nIdea retrievers are not a breed, but a job description. Any dog patient enough to put up with a trainer and dexterous with his forepaws can fetch ideas.\nI live with my family and our dogs in a converted Catholic church. There\u2019s still some residual prejudice from other trainers at letting dogs eat at your table and sleep on your furniture, but how else can you keep an eye on valuable animals when you can\u2019t afford to hire a security guard? Most of our dogs are from the pound, and all of them work, even if the job is official bed-warmer. Most of my family train bully drafters, rented out with a cart for the day. We\u2019re able to keep track of the drafters through microchipping and the dogs\u2019 ingrained habit of being fed dinner at precisely five o\u2019clock. Bully drafters are just as strong as a pony, but easier to clean up after, and often the only means of transport for seniors or those with leg infirmaries. Sometimes we all miss the cars, but at least the roads are safer for dogs and the ambulances now.\nNo one had a dog cart when I was a little girl. But when cars and motorcycles became illegal, suddenly anyone with a hyperactive mutt had a guaranteed trip at least to the shops and back. You try hauling groceries for a family of four on a bike or on the hydraulic trolley.\nSci was too proud to haul a cart, even though most dogs think its good fun. He just lay down and refused to budge. As he was almost a hundred pounds, trying to move this canine Gibraltar was an exercise in abject futility.\nBut he loved hunting ideas. That and making people jump by jabbing his nose on unsuspecting skin. He didn\u2019t want to waste time pulling carts, catching Frisbees or prancing about a proxy ring when he could chase down impressions of thoughts lost to living man that hide in thick overlapping morphic fields. Bringing back a live one was Sci\u2019s whole reason for being. He patiently waited while I exercised the drafters before I could put him to the hunt.\nBats have radar. Dolphins have sonar. Dogs have smell. Smell can give a dog a mental image of the scent-maker as clear as any radar. Reynard\u2019s bent genius was in figuring how to get his retrievers to show him what they smelled.\nThe training isn\u2019t too hard, but you have to be patient and persistent, which is difficult. Make it easy at first. Have a big photo of a cat, for example. Take it and the dog to that cat\u2019s litter box while chilling a bottle of champagne. Have the dog sniff the litter and then touch the dog\u2019s paw with the photo of the cat. Reward the dog for tapping the cat photo. Have a photo of another animal with the cat photo. Reward the dog when he taps only the cat photo. Then take a photo of the cat and another cat that does not use the litter box. When the dog is able to pick out the cat from a selection of other cat images, you\u2019ve got the hardest part done. Then you have to teach your dog to scratch out a rough version of the cat image. It never will look anything like a cat, but it\u2019ll wind up being a shorthand glyph between you and your dog for \u201ccat\u201d. Then you move on to more abstract images like letters.\nOnce they get that they are able to let you know what they see through scent, pop the champagne. You\u2019ve got yourself an idea retriever.\nWorking with a particular dog long enough, you start getting the gist of what ideas he\u2019s trying to describe to you. All dog owners have this bond to some degree. A whine could mean \u201cI have to go out,\u201d while the same whine done by another dog could mean something else.\nPeople still think it\u2019s all a hoax. They think we trained the dogs to tap cards in certain patterns. There has to be a catch, they insist. But there\u2019s no catch\u2014-with scent, dogs can not only see in their heads what was there, but how big it was, and what it last ate.\nThen it was only a few steps sideways to discover that ideas have smells. Perhaps ideas pee. I\u2019m not sure, but I\u2019m also not sure how my camera works. Strong, repeated thoughts can be caught. A retriever can see them with his nose. A great retriever like Sci can draw it.\nIdeas are nothing but a series of charged chemicals, Reynard explained. They stick to morphic fields like spoor on a forest floor. Most scientists you\u2019ll meet will roll their eyes at the mention of morphic fields, vast energy cells that grab and hold race memories and behaviors like images to photographic negatives, because they\u2019re only a theory. I point out that evolution is still technically a theory, but they never seem impressed by that. So I ignore them and instead watch Sci bring ideas back to me.\nSir Reynard\u2019s legendary bitch, the aforementioned God, solved murders and kidnappings. She could recapture the crime at the scene. She never could draw a good likeness of a suspect, or of a human for that matter, but could pick out things like what was on the bottom of the shoes, what book was in his pocket, or what McDonald\u2019s he\u2019d just visited.\nSci could find chapters from dead writers. He\u2019s not a furry Ouiji board -\u2014 but if the deceased had thought about something long enough, the patterns impressed on the fields to create enough of a morphic resonance that Sci can sniff. But Sci could track down Jesus H Christ and that wouldn\u2019t impress a \u201creal\u201d scientist.\nThis made it all the more surprising when I got the call from the University of Penn, begging Sci to come out and hunt the office of their leading atmospheric chemical engineer, who\u2019d died that morning.\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Sci!\u201d I hollered. \u201cTrolley ride!\u201d\n#\n\u201cStacy Jones?\u201d\n\u201cYo,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd Science Jones.\u201d\nSergeant Maddox grinned at my huge, floppy eared, floppy coated retriever. Sci was a familiar visitor to the Philadelphia Police. \u201cHey, buddy, you\u2019re on the list, too. Did you see the doc for blood and hair samples?\u201d\n\u201cOh, he met us at the door.\u201d I rolled up my sleeve to show the bandage to prove it.\n\u201cWell, you two are free to do the voodoo that you two do.\u201d\n\u201cYou really got to let me in on where you get your donuts.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? And lose our only advantage over the bad guys? They already get guns easily enough \u2014- but us boys in blue will be damned if they get our Secret Formula Donuts, too.\u201d\nHe lifted the yellow police tape for us to enter the tiny office. If the body hadn\u2019t already been taken away, there wouldn\u2019t have been any room for Sci to turn around in. He sniffed at a bloodstain on the frayed carpet. It was such a relief not to deal with a homicide scene for a change. Poor bastard just got drunk, fell and snapped his neck.\n\u201cA DOG? Harris, you mean to tell me the expert you called in is a DOG?\u201d From the way the conceit echoed down the university hallway, I knew a Youngblood was coming. After losing their chemical factories in Delaware, most Youngbloods had been either jailed or forced to do community service. Heading the University of Penn Atmospheric Chemical Engineering department seemed to be the best community service his lawyer could get. \u201cWhich Youngblood is that?\u201d I asked the Sergeant without turning around.\n\u201cI dunno. They all smell alike to me.\u201d\n\u201cIts okay, Mr. Youngblood,\u201d soothed the voice I\u2019d talked to on the phone. \u201cThe dog\u2019s an idea retriever. He\u2019s the same one who caught the Pine Barren killer last year.\u201d\n\u201cOh, PUH-lease, Harris!\u201d\n\u201cOoo, looky, its break time,\u201d snorted the Sergeant, and gave me a sympathetic look before ambling off. \u201cHappy hunting.\u201d\n\u201cHarris, I\u2019m not authorizing this esteemed University to pay for every nutcase with a mutt to poke about,\u201d the Youngblood grumbled to the short, stoop-shouldered man next to him, who I assumed was Harris. I wondered how long it would be before Youngblood threatened to take his ball and go home to his private high rise in Wilmington. That, the judge let him keep.\n\u201cThis is the dog that also discovered the final chapters of Stephen King\u2019s last thriller . . . months after King\u2019s death.\u201d Harris kindly saved me the trouble of bragging about Sci. Personally, I\u2019d like to wear a huge neon sign pointing to Sci that he saved the climax of the last Stephen King, but Sci preferred that I get him a better brand of dog food, instead.\nThe Youngblood held out his hand to me and smirked, \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve met a ghostwriter.\u201d\nI swallowed my nausea and shook the hand of the convicted eco-criminal and amateur book critic. \u201cThanks for the compliment about the King book. Tell you the truth, I can\u2019t even write a shopping list.\u201d\nHarris shook my hand while Youngblood grumbled. I much preferred Harris\u2019 touch. \u201cI\u2019ve been a fan of Stephen King since the womb. Plums Deify was vintage King\u2014all of it. You can\u2019t tell what was written before he died and what came after. I was hoping you and your furry friend could do the same for us.\u201d\n\u201cSo I\u2019d gathered,\u201d I replied. \u201cThis is the department that\u2019s working on fixing that hole in the ozone layer,\u201d (because of creeps like your boss putting a hole there I wanted to add but didn\u2019t), \u201cNature reported that Professor Mitchell\u2019s chemical cocktails sprayed from aerosol cans proved promising at strengthening the existing ozone.\u201d\n\u201cThey were more than promising,\u201d the Youngblood grated, \u201cthey were vital. All of the Youngblood factories that haven\u2019t been stolen by the fascists in the EPA have been converted to make this cocktail. You have any idea how much that costs? Mitchell was last looking at best methods of dispersion before he tripped the light fantastic.\u201d\nI tried to look sympathetically at Youngblood. He was, after all, a client. He was also part of a clan that was directly responsible for global warming. Part of his native Delaware had already dropped into the Atlantic. Wilmington was becoming an island. He was lucky not to have been sentenced to medical research. I suppose the rest of us who eagerly bought the crap made in his factories deserved the same fate, but we needed a scapegoat and the Youngbloods just fit the role so sweetly.\nHe looked at his gold watch, and suddenly leaped so high his hair weave brushed the ceiling.\n\u201cSCI!\u201d I hissed, and Sci turned innocently back to the office, gently wagging his tail.\n\u201cDamn BEAST!\u201d Sci\u2019s latest victim spluttered, \u201cHe put a hole in my sock!\u201d\n\u201cSci is very glad to meet you, sir,\u201d I said, knowing that Sci\u2019s nose had found a previously existing hole in the sock. \u201cMay I take this opportunity to remind you that we\u2019re donating our services today?\u201d\n\u201cWhat could it hurt to try, sir?\u201d Harris piped up.\n\u201cI\u2019d best be off to the geek HQ to see if they found anything in Mitchell\u2019s hard drive,\u201d Youngblood said, wiping his ankle with a handkerchief. \u201cThat\u2019s a better use of my time. I will call in precisely one hour, Harris.\u201d He ended with a growl that would\u2019ve set any pit bull scampering, and then stomped away.\nHarris peeked at me sheepishly over the rims of his glasses. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s been a bad day.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to work for him. Sci is glad to help. Aren\u2019t you, mate?\u201d\nSci yawned and stretched, eager to get on with it.\nI lay down cards with letters and numbers, then handed a handful of blank ones to Harris. \u201cI think I remember you saying you were Professor Mitchell\u2019s assistant? If you could fill these cards in with any formulas or jargon you two used often, it might save us a heck of a lot of time.\u201d I then lay a roll of white shelf lining paper down, then coated Sci\u2019s right front paw with washable kids\u2019 paint.\n\u201cIs that his drawing paw?\u201d\n\u201cYes. And before you ask, he\u2019s right handed.\u201d\nHarris filled the cards with engineering mumbo jumbo. He had a cute way of scrunching up his mouth as he concentrated. He caught me studying him and I think the both of us blushed. \u201cAnything else I can do to help?\u201d\n\u201cI could murder a cup of tea.\u201d\n\u201cMy pleasure. How long did you live in England?\u201d\n\u201cLong enough, mate.\u201d\nSci was already stalking the hypothesis before Harris and Sgt. Maddox returned with lukewarm, blindingly sweet caffeine. Sci kept circling where the chair was, tracking the idea through the resonating layers of morphic fields that I wish I could see.\n\u201cCool. I love it when he does this,\u201d Sgt. Maddox grinned, a true Sci fan.\n\u201cWhy did Professor Mitchell have such a tiny office?\u201d I wondered aloud.\nHarris replied, \u201cIt was easier for him to sneak a drink that way.\u201d\n\u201cMiss him?\u201d\n\u201cHim, no. His genius, yes.\u201d\nWow. We had something in common. I started to wonder what Harris looked like naked when Sci suddenly scampered to the contact paper. Oh yes \u2014- the ozone layer solution. \u201cShow Mummy, Sci,\u201d I encouraged. He scratched an arrow, then some sort of blob above it. The tea went cold as I snapped Sci\u2019s scratches with my camera phone, then bent to wipe the contact paper clean. My heart started to beat in time to Sci\u2019s sniffs as he stood on his hind legs, his blunt, black head weaving back and forth in the air, flushing the theorem out.\n\u201cThis making any sense so far?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cNope,\u201d Harris admitted. \u201cBut Black Arrow was Mitchell\u2019s preferred beer.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026great\u2026\u201d\nSci hit a series of number cards\u2014-6,2,1,0,0,3, then two letters\u2014a P and an M. \u201cThese make any sense to you?\u201d\n\u201cNope.\u201d\n\u201cWhat chemicals are a P and an M?\u201d\n\u201cP is phosphorous. But there is no chemical with an abbreviation of M.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not meant to be chemicals, then,\u201d Sgt. Maddox suggested.\nSci started scratching on the paper again. I had to stop him to repaint his paw. Sgt Maddox took over photography so I could concentrate on trying to decipher Sci\u2019s glyph system. What Sci scratched out now looked like a box with the lid caved in, with a small triangle on top. From Sci\u2019s past drawings, I knew that the triangle and the crushed box meant to occupy the same space. \u201cPlease tell me that this looks familiar to somebody,\u201d I sighed.\nHarris shrugged and Sgt. Maddox kept clicking photos.\nSci sat, indicating he was done with this drawing. While he waited for me to wipe the shelf lining paper clean, he wriggled, whined and repeatedly sneezed.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the reason for your sneezin\u2019?\u201d I said automatically, as that\u2019s what I always say to my dogs when they sneeze.\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t sneezed before, has he?\u201d Sgt Maddox asked.\n\u201cHe sneezes nearly every day.\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2014I mean when he\u2019s retrieving. I\u2019ve seen many idea retrievers on a hunt and they usually don\u2019t sneeze. Do you think that means anything?\u201d\n\u201cDogs usually sneeze to try to clear their noses, even if it\u2019s just a strong smell they\u2019re trying to get rid of.\u201d\nI said, still wondering when triangles and boxes occupy the same space. When Sci\u2019s paw was repainted, I sent him off again.\nWith frantic obsession, Sci quivered and panted while sniffing, staring and scratching a short line with a small dark circle on the top. Again, he sneezed. He kept sneezing. I reached out to check his nose for physical obstructions, but then Sci was off again, smacking cards.\n3, 6, 1, S, I, M, N, S, T\nSci sneezed a final time and whined. He looked at what I couldn\u2019t see and he cringed. It looked as if he was frightened of the air. How could I comfort him from what was invisible? I spoke soothing nonsense, but Sci wasn\u2019t buying it. He slunk into the hall and before the nearest door to the outside, quivering. He\u2019d had enough.\n\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with him?\u201d Harris laughed, and sounded too much like Reynard for me to ever wonder what he looked like naked ever again.\n\u201cYes, Einstein, he\u2019s scared shitless!\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the rest of the retrieval?\u201d\n\u201cThere is no more. That\u2019s it,\u201d I lied.\nHarris rolled his eyes. \u201cIt would be just like Mitchell\u2014he\u2019s pissed off that he\u2019s dead, so he took his final discovery with him!\u201d\nSci quivered all the way home. I quivered, too, but in rage that I could not help my dog.\n#\nI spent a sleepless night, worried sick about Sci. In contrast, he slept soundly on the floor in his usual spot. When he wanted breakfast, which just happened to coincide with me finally drifting off, he jammed his frigid nose into my bare feet. It was then I knew he was fully recovered.\nGoing to the door, he wagged his tail at the day.\nI wondered what had unnerved him so. There was still so much a dog cannot communicate to his human. But that he could rebound from such a fright so quickly made me wish he could explain how I could be calm again, too.\n#\nSgt. Maddox took me out for lunch about a month later, when the time at the University had been shoved out of my head by the usual day to day concerns of running a family business. He brought up the topic so casually; I knew that this was the entire reason for the lunch treatment.\n\u201cBy the way, I did some background checks on that Penn Professor\u2014-remember him? Well, turns out when the good Prof was five years old, his neighbor\u2019s home burnt down, killing the kids napping inside. Definitely arson, but the case was never solved . . . until now.\u201d\nThe penny didn\u2019t take long to drop. \u201cThe Professor--? But he was only five at the time! How can you be sure?\u201d\n\u201cThe first set of numbers Sci pointed to turned out to be the date of the fire\u2014June 21, 2000. It happened about three in the afternoon.\u201d\n\u201cThe P and the M, of course.\u201d And I\u2019d rashly assumed a dying chemist would think about chemicals right until the end! \u201cSo the designs Sci drew . . . \u201d\n\u201c. . . were most likely a burning house and a match. And the house was at the second set of numbers\u2014361 Simon Street. The house was at the corner. The house burnt, but the sign was untouched. That\u2019s a little too much detail for mere coincidence. Could be the reason the Professor started to drink in the first place. Also explains why Sci kept sneezing. You ever smell a burnt home with someone inside? Makes you gag.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take your word for it,\u201d I replied. \u201cUm, all of this didn\u2019t help with the ozone problem, did it?\u201d\n\u201cStacey, haven\u2019t you ever studied the history of science? They never discover what they set out to discover. Penicillin was accidental, remember. So there\u2019s no magic solution to the hole in the sky. But Sci may have been able to repair somebody\u2019s soul as it was looking the Great Unknown in the face. That\u2019s gotta be worth something to the department. Who knows how many crimes we could solve? I know you won\u2019t sell Sci, but you could teach us ignorant cops how to train more idea retrievers like Sci. Remember Harris, the Prof\u2019s assistant? He wants to write a paper about Sci. And his boss Youngblood asked the Mayor to have you\u2014-yes, YOU\u2014to be funded by the City to teach at the University.\u201d\n\u201cYoungblood? Are you kidding?\u201d\n\u201cDo I look like I\u2019m kidding?\u201d\n\u201cWow. I guess I might start liking the guy. What a concept!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it sucks when people fail to act like their stereotypes, let me tell you. You are going to accept the Mayor\u2019s proposal when he gives you a surprise visit tomorrow at noon, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cOf COURSE I will!\u201d I replied, and suddenly I could not remember what Reynard looked like anymore. \u201cYou never know what that dog\u2019s nose will get you into.\u201d\nRena Sherwood has lived in both England and America.

Morris\nWolfgang Kopf glared at Wales, the Susan Constant\u2019s steward, and wondered how the human race had survived generation after generation of such slime. Wales was Ugarte in Casablanca or Judas in every Passion play ever performed. Shakespeare had undoubtedly modeled his traitorous Brutus on one of the steward\u2019s direct ancestors.\nWales said, \u201cYou\u2019re the agent for the Four Dollies. Tell me their specialties and how much they charge guys a pop.\u201d\n\u201cI arrange their bookings and oversee their accommodations. Despite the Dollies\u2019 misbehavior on occasion, they aren\u2019t hookers and I\u2019m not a pimp. Furthermore, I have the captain\u2019s assurance that. . . .\u201d\n\u201cThe Old Man is dead. So are the mate and the propulsion officer. Mr. Smith and Mr. Rolfe, the junior officers, are running the ship. They\u2019re taking us to where all but three crewmen agreed to go. Those three are dead, too.\u201d\nThe steward described mutiny.\n\u201cWhere are we headed?\u201d asked Wolf.\n\u201cAn uninhabited planet. We figure we\u2019re ten Adams\u2013eleven, if we let you live\u2013bound for Eden with our four Eves.\u201d\nThe ratio combined with the men\u2019s criminality sounded like a recipe for murder. An agent knew how to bargain for his clients. Wolf would try at once.\n\u201cThe Dollies are ladies,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYeah, sure. Ladies who work topless. We\u2019ve heard about their shows. The two officers with us saw one two stops back.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s an illusion, Wales.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does that mean, Kopf?\u201d\n\u201cShow business is about what an audience wants. The majority of the natural resource retrievers on the planets, moons, and asteroids we tour are male. The females among them aren\u2019t glamorous. The Dollies are beauties who make men imagine they\u2019re available. The men who win their full love will treat them like ladies.\u201d\n\u201cIf we give them a choice,\u201d Wales said, laughing nastily.\n#\nBabs the raven-haired Dolly, said, \u201cWho needs an agent who negotiates the terms of our rapes instead of our rescue? You\u2019re fired.\u201d\nAnn the redhead, said, \u201cDon\u2019t be dumb, Babs. We can\u2019t drive a spaceship. Even if we could figure out how to run this thing, we wouldn\u2019t know which way to go. Wolfie, do your best for us.\u201d\nPam the brunette and Eve the blonde said nothing. Along with Babs they made Ann seem like a genius because she could discuss more than shin splints and mascara. The Dollies were dancers who also sang and acted adequately on good days.\nBack in his own cabin, Wolf analyzed the situation. The more he thought about it, the greater his amazement at being alive. He was middle aged and without any skill that promised to prove valuable on an uninhabited planet. He wouldn\u2019t ask his captors questions. This mutiny didn\u2019t appear to be the work of geniuses. The little he knew about military history said that few mutinies worked out over the long run. If the mutineers hadn\u2019t thought about whether he had any value, he wouldn\u2019t tell them he was probably useless.\nWhat could he do for the Dollies? Seemingly nothing until they were rescued. Then he\u2019d negotiate the sale of their lurid account of the adventure\u2013for his usual percentage, of course.\n#\n\u201cCan you cook?\u201d Wales asked Wolf.\n\u201cSimple dishes. Why?\u201d\n\u201cHave you noticed the food on the Susan Constant?\u201d\n\u201cMonotonous. Typical rations when the owner of a vessel is a cheapskate.\u201d\n\u201cWhen we touch down in a few hours, we\u2019ll hunt and fish and find edible plants. We had to kill our only shipmate who could do more than warm up space rations. You now have a new job, Kopf. Do it well and live.\u201d\nWolf hoped a steady diet of space rations had dulled the mutineers\u2019 collective taste buds. He hadn\u2019t lied when he said he could cook, but he\u2019d never trusted his culinary skills to impress a business contact or seduce a woman. Of course, what he was given to cook would probably pose a more serious problem. The Susan Constant carried no medical personnel. Once the men succeeded in hunting, fishing, and gathering, they\u2019d lack any way of ascertaining which flora and fauna were safe to eat. If his first bad dish didn\u2019t fatally poison all hands, the survivors would probably turn on him. Carbon-oxygen planets had many similarities, so that all could support some form of human life, but even a small difference could prove fatal.\nWolf felt the vessel shiver. The lights blinked off for a minute, then came back on at a lower level and wavered as the voltage varied. The ship yawed. The artificial gravity cut out and Wolf floated out of his chair. He grabbed at the arms, but missed. The gravity came back on and he crashed on the chair hard enough to make his teeth click together. He cursed. The ship shuddered, then fell silent as the lights went out again, the gravity cut off, and the ventilation ceased.\n\u201cThey killed the only guys who can fly this wreck,\u201d he muttered.\nAir began circulating again, although with less force than normal. For a moment, Wolf thought the artificial gravity had resumed working weakly. Then he realized he felt the beginnings of planetary gravity as they penetrated the atmosphere of whatever uninhabited world the mutineers had chosen for refuge. He strapped himself into his chair.\nThe safest place to land was in bed. With variable gravity and no lights, trying to reach his narrow bunk would be risky. A chair with proper restraints was supposedly almost as safe. Wolf doubted that it mattered where he was when they landed. The mutineers had apparently damaged the ship. Even an expert might not be able to pilot it to a safe landing. He\u2019d rather die sitting up than cringing in bed.\nHe\u2019d been aware of death\u2019s possibility for the past dozen years since he\u2019d begun traveling with groups of performers. Most vessels were like the Susan Constant: crowded, uncomfortable, smelly, cursed with bad chow. It was a living, though.\nA living isn\u2019t a life, he thought.\nHow should he have done things differently? Wolf lacked time to itemize his regrets. The vessel dropped rapidly toward the planet. The temperature climbed, overmatching the ventilation system. Dying promised to be uncomfortable.\n#\nAlthough Wolf didn\u2019t pass out, the pain radiating from the base of his spine was so intense that he remained unaware of his surroundings for an indeterminate amount of time. There\u2019d been sufficient power to save the Susan Constant from a massively destructive crash, so if his chair had contained more padding, he might not have suffered agony and the temporary paralysis accompanying it. One more sin to hold against the vessel\u2019s owner.\nThe lights remained off. He heard no sounds. Absolute silence was so different from space travel as he\u2019d always known it that he thought for a moment his injury had destroyed his hearing. Then he became aware of scrabbling and squeaking from the passageway outside the cabin.\n\u201cMice?\u201d he muttered.\nEven on an interplanetary sty such as the Susan Constant, rodent infestation seemed unlikely. Wolf heard the door open. He saw no change in the blackness.\n\u201cWolfie?\u201d\nHe recognized Ann\u2019s voice.\n\u201cIn the chair,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get oriented. Are the Dollies all right?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re shaken up, but we remembered to crawl into our beds and hang on. We\u2019re scared. Our emergency lights don\u2019t work.\u201d\nHe unstrapped himself and stood on wobbly legs. His hands in front of him, he blundered toward a bulkhead. When he reached it, he knelt and felt his way toward the door until he found the cabin\u2019s battle lantern in its wall bracket. He switched it on. Nothing happened. The switch clicked loudly as he pushed it back and forth several times.\n\u201cYours is dead, too?\u201d Ann asked.\n\u201cYeah. It worked when we boarded this ship. Do you hear anyone besides us stirring?\u201d\n\u201cBabs and Pam thought they heard moaning. What do we do?\u201d\nWolf said, \u201cWe get off this wreck.\u201d\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\u201cFollow me.\u201d\nDancers, he thought disgustedly. The Dollies had no notion where the nearest emergency exit was. He\u2019d long ago given up nagging performers about safety procedures. They thought him foolish for locating exits and memorizing the most direct routes to them.\nWolf got himself erect, ignored the occasional pains shooting through his legs, and worked his way along the bulkhead. He reached the bulkhead with the door and turned right. He moved a few feet and his hand touched soft warmth.\n\u201cLater, Wolfie,\u201d Ann said.\nShe giggled as he apologized.\nHe said, \u201cListen up, Dollies. Go back past your quarters. Before you reach the next cross passageway, you\u2019ll find a small hatch set in the bulkhead to your left. It\u2019s where the hull tapers in sharply. A wheel opens it. The top of the hatch isn\u2019t quite waist high. All right?\u201d\nThey said yes uncertainly; then Babs added, \u201cYou go first, Wolfie. We don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going.\u201d\nWhat else was new?\n\u201cGet behind me,\u201d he ordered. \u201cKeep your hands on the bulkhead to your left. Let\u2019s not waste time.\u201d\nWolf put his hand on the bulkhead and began moving. He didn\u2019t dare go too fast because he might encounter debris. He hadn\u2019t heard anything fall or break when the Susan Constant hit the ground, but he\u2019d been so shaken that he could have missed lots of noises. He assumed the first part of the trip would be clear since the Dollies had made it to his cabin.\n\u201cAre you keeping up?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cYes,\u201d they said in unison.\nHe knew he\u2019d reached Babs\u2019 door when he nearly fell through it. She\u2019d left it open, a typical bit of dancer\u2019s carelessness. The species always left evidence of its passage. He still remembered the trouble that ensued when a male dancer he represented had caused a backstage fire by hanging a shirt on the bare light bulbs flanking a dressing room mirror. The shirt was sweaty, he\u2019d said, and he wanted to dry it before wearing it again.\nWolf heard a shriek and a thud behind him.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t close your door, you dumb bimbo,\u201d Eve said to Babs. \u201cI\u2019ll have a bruised hip. Wolfie, why didn\u2019t you warn us?\u201d\n\u201cIf a clumsy agent didn\u2019t fall through the door, why should I think a graceful dancer would?\u201d\nPam said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about my door, Wolfie. I closed it.\u201d\nBabs and Pam roomed on his side of the corridor, Eve and Ann opposite them. Cabins on the Susan Constant were so tiny they barely held one passenger and assorted luggage. Wolf considered that the vessel\u2019s one decent feature. Roommates frequently quarreled.\nHe touched the bulkhead as lightly as possible. When he reached Pam\u2019s door, it opened under his fingers.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t close your door all the way, Pam. Be careful, Dollies.\u201d\nHe crouched lower in case cables dangled from overhead. He also moved faster, opening up a lead. He didn\u2019t need the Dollies atop him when he tackled the escape hatch. They still squeaked and swore their way past Pam\u2019s door when he knelt in front of the small exit.\nThe design had been around since shipbuilders discovered how to divide a vessel into watertight compartments. A seal around the hatch\u2019s edge made it fit snugly in its opening, while dogs held it firmly against the bulkhead. A wheel controlled the dogs. Because this was space, where even a tiny leak could cause immediate disaster, a large cotter pin kept the wheel immobile and the dogs in place.\nOn a properly maintained vessel the pin would have been regularly lubricated so that any adult could pull it out in case of emergency. This was the Susan Constant, though, almost a derelict. Wolf momentarily panicked when his first efforts didn\u2019t dislodge the pin. He breathed deeply several times, then yanked as hard as he could.\n\u201cOuch!\u201d he said, adding profanity as he banged the back of his right hand on one of the dogs.\n\u201cWolfie, are you all right?\u201d asked Pam, bumping into him.\n\u201cYeah. I hope I get a chance to tell the travel agency I\u2019ve used for years why I\u2019ll never book another tour through them.\u201d\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cThe Susan Constant. This tub should be grounded.\u201d\n\u201cIt feels as if it is,\u201d Ann said, joining them. \u201cIs this funny little door our exit?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Pam, you\u2019re closest. Grab this wheel and help me twist it.\u201d\n\u201cWhich way?\u201d she wanted to know.\n\u201cCounterclockwise.\u201d\n\u201cWhich way is that?\u201d\n\u201cThe top of the wheel moves toward your left as you face it.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nHow could a dancer not know clockwise from counterclockwise? Even though the old-style timepieces were found only in museums, the terms remained current.\n\u201cReady?\u201d Wolf asked.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nHe felt her hands fumbling on the wheel.\n\u201cOn three,\u201d he told her. \u201cOne. Two. Three.\u201d\nHe grunted as he threw his full weight into the effort. The wheel and dogs shrieked and momentarily froze.\n\u201cAgain,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t hold anything back.\u201d\nHe counted and they heaved. The dogs shrieked and broke free. As the wheel spun its full distance, Wolf and Pam got tangled up and fell to the deck. She yelped. He quickly got off her.\n\u201cGood work,\u201d he said.\n\u201cMy butt hurts.\u201d\n\u201cYou may stay alive long enough to appreciate its quitting aching.\u201d\nHe dragged the hatch open as the hinges protested. When it hit Pam, she cursed and crawled out of the way. He pushed it against the bulkhead. The Susan Constant had a slight list toward the side they wished to escape from, so the hatch stayed wide open without being held.\n\u201cThis door doesn\u2019t lead anywhere,\u201d Babs said. \u201cWhy\u2019s it the exit?\u201d\nWolf thought of all the brilliant women in the universe\u2013physicists, surgeons, artists, political leaders, theologians\u2013and wondered why he\u2019d got stuck with four dancers. No need to explain double hulls. That he saw no light around the outer hatch and didn\u2019t smell fresh air suggested that the vessel retained airtight integrity. The next wheel should turn easily. Its dogs were part of the edge and went into the hull, not against it. They came with permanent lubrication sealed in. He grabbed and turned. It moved smoothly and almost silently.\nIt hit the stop. According to the diagram he\u2019d studied, he needed only push outward. The hinges were at the bottom. Gravity should make it open. He pushed. The hatch moved only slightly. He pushed harder. It still resisted him. He pulled his hands back into the passageway.\n\u201cI need a Dolly with powerful dancer\u2019s legs,\u201d he said.\n\u201cRight here,\u201d Babs told him. \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d\nHe coached her into a sitting position beside him, so that the left side of his body and the right side of hers touched as they put their feet and ankles into the space between the hulls. He felt a lot of warm, bare flesh and wondered if all the Dollies were scantily clad. He told Babs to put her feet on the wheel and scoot forward, so that their knees were raised.\n\u201cMake sure your feet are on the wheel, not between it and the hatch,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you feel yourself sliding out, put your right arm around me and throw out your left to grab the bulkhead.\u201d\nHe counted to three, his right hand braced on the deck for additional power. Their combined kick made the hatch fly open, drop, and bang against the hull. Bright sunlight blinded Wolf momentarily.\n\u201cYow!\u201d Babs yelled in triumph. \u201cWe\u2019re outa here.\u201d\nWhen she moved, Wolf shifted around and stuck his head out the hatch. He saw sandy beach and, not far away, surging ocean. It was about two meters to the ground. He looked forward and aft, but saw no one outside the Susan Constant.\n\u201cThis will be an easy drop for dancers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll head inland in case the tide is out. This craft could topple at any minute.\u201d\nFour Dollies dropped, with Ann going last. Each shrieked or squealed as she went out the hatch and landed on the sand. Wolf noted that none wore a lot. The air coming in was warm, however, and he assumed the mutineers would have coveralls that would fit the women if the night turned cold or if they began to burn. If, he thought wryly, there were still mutineers. Two Dollies had heard groans, the only sign of other life in the ship. He had no idea how they\u2019d survive if their captors hadn\u2019t.\nWolf dropped onto the sand, grunting and almost going to his knees. When he looked up a rifle was pointed directly at his face.\n\u201cGlad you made it, Kopf,\u201d said Wales. \u201cFour of us didn\u2019t.\u201d\n#\nThey sat in a hollow between dunes and watched the five crew members who were mobile unload supplies. Wolf wondered why they hadn\u2019t ordered him to serve as a mule. A sixth mutineer, immobilized by a broken left leg, sat holding a rifle on them. The Dollies remained quiet. They\u2019d behaved meekly since seeing Wales\u2019 gun.\nMost of what the crew unloaded consisted of more rifles and ammunition. They also brought some space rations over to a spot among the dunes. Wolf suddenly noticed that both his slacks and his shirt had developed holes. How had that occurred? Did something in the air corrode certain substances? If so, why didn\u2019t he feel more skin irritation than he normally expected from sand?\nHe\u2019d resigned himself to death and simply hoped that it came without pain. Neither of the officers had survived the landing. Space crews seldom possessed skills not related directly to their work. Hunting and fishing and gathering plants were no part of space survival. Wolf had fished when he went to the beach as a young man. The water had been so polluted, however, that he\u2019d thrown back his catches and therefore had no idea what an edible fish looked like.\nThis strip of beach and ocean didn\u2019t look polluted. The flotsam near the water was of natural origin. There were none of the cans, jars, plastic, and garbage humans had dumped in Earth\u2019s ocean for generations. The water itself was a rich blue found only in paintings from the past or a few spots in the middle of the Pacific or Atlantic Oceans.\nFinally, the men relaxed. Wales resumed the duty of pointing a gun at Wolf and the Four Dollies. The mutineers griped about the labor and about their failure to land properly. They blamed the two officers and Wolf realized they\u2019d angrily killed them before starting to offload supplies and weapons.\nThen one of them said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t all their fault. There\u2019s something weird about this planet. The Susan Constant was coming down fine, headed for a nice spot of prairie near a big river, a place filled with wildlife. Then it was like some outside force took over. We got dragged down here. I think that was the planet, not the people conning the ship.\u201d\n\u201cSo why all the breakdowns?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cThe soles are coming off my boots,\u201d said another man.\n\u201cNothing works right,\u201d Wales said. \u201cIt was a lousy tub.\u201d\nA loud crash came from inside the ship.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go hunting,\u201d said the man who\u2019d talked about the ship\u2019s strange behavior as it landed. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how fast the sun sets because we aren\u2019t sure of the latitude. We\u2019ll also gather sticks and brush as well as scout the land. Wales, they\u2019re your prisoners. They know you. Carter can\u2019t do it all\u2013not with that leg.\u201d\n\u201cWhat makes you think we\u2019re going anywhere?\u201d Wolf asked.\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Wales said.\nAn agent can\u2019t negotiate when one side won\u2019t talk. Wolf watched the men move along the dunes and then turn inland and disappear eventually into a line of trees. He stretched out on his back and relaxed. He hadn\u2019t been sleeping well recently. Lying in the warm sun might let him take a nap.\n#\n\u201cWolfie, wake up,\u201d Ann said urgently. \u201cOur clothes are falling apart and our captors are either asleep or passed out.\u201d\nHis shoes had separated everywhere that one part joined another. He stood and the tatters of his shirt and slacks fell away. He looked at the Dollies. Eve had on a bra and briefs. Ann and Pam wore only briefs, while Babs was nude. There weren\u2019t nearly enough shreds of clothing on the sand to account for his missing garments.\nCarter and Wales wore disintegrating coveralls. Coveralls were standard issue to all space crews, and while their precise composition varied from manufacturer to manufacturer, all were fabricated to repel radiation and to protect the wearer from a variety of other space hazards.\n\u201cFabricated,\u201d he said, looking down to make sure his briefs remained intact. \u201cCotton is natural. Eve, is your lingerie cotton?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about your briefs, Pam and Ann?\u201d\nThey nodded affirmatively.\n\u201cAnd all the other clothing you ladies were wearing was made of synthetic materials?\u201d\nThey indicated that he was correct but didn\u2019t ask him what it meant. He studied the sleeping mutineers. It wasn\u2019t time to attack. He and the Dollies could easily overpower Carter and Wales, but that left four other men to deal with. Besides, no matter how incompetent the mutineers proved themselves, their presence increased everyone\u2019s chances of survival.\nHe looked at the ship. Holes had appeared in the hull. It listed more toward the ocean.\nWolf said, \u201cWe\u2019ve landed in the Stone Age. Neither chemistry nor engineering remains operational.\u201d\nThirsty, he walked to where the mutineers had stacked the water containers they\u2019d salvaged from the Susan Constant. Only a few of them, those made of glass, had water. The plastic ones had disintegrated. He lugged two jugs to the Dollies while Wales and Carter continued sleeping.\n\u201cDrink up,\u201d he said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t much water left\u2013unless the local oceans contain fresh water. We may have to check that hope out.\u201d\n\u201cI bet it\u2019s fresh,\u201d Eve said. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t smell like a real ocean. When I was little, people talked about a saltwater smell.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder if our visitors smell,\u201d Pam said. \u201cTalk about way out costumes, they\u2019re wearing some.\u201d\nWolf looked, then yelled, \u201cWales, wake up.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Wales said, groggily sitting up.\n\u201cMen carrying spears and wearing skins or furs closing from inland.\u201d\nWales jumped to his feet and pointed his rifle at the newcomers. He pulled the trigger. Nothing happened. He flicked the safety back and forth much the same way Wolf had clicked the battle lantern\u2019s switch on and off a few hours earlier. Then he ejected the magazine and inserted another. The gun still refused to fire. He tossed it aside and yanked Carter\u2019s away from the prone man. He turned and again tried unsuccessfully to fire on the advancing group.\n\u201cTime to save our lives, if I can,\u201d Wolf told the Dollies.\nHe picked up Wales\u2019 discarded rifle and used it as a club, hitting the steward in the right temple with the stock. Wales fell face forward. Wolf raised the rifle and brought it down hard on Wales\u2019 head. The third time he repeated the action, the rifle came apart. He tossed the barrel aside.\n\u201cSome of those shirtless men are women,\u201d Babs said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel so exposed.\u201d\nHe ordered the Dollies to fan out so that they stood in a line. The group moved steadily toward them in an arc that closed in from both flanks. What kind of sign would show peaceful intent? They wouldn\u2019t get a second chance if they blew it.\nWolf said, \u201cSpread your arms wide. Hold your hands palms up or forward and keep them open.\u201d\nThe party came to within three meters of them and stopped. An older man moved forward and spoke in the Standard language of intergalactic travel.\n\u201cExcept for the one on the ground, you aren\u2019t part of the crew. What happened?\u201d\n\u201cThe crew mutinied. These women and I were passengers. The man you just saw me kill has been holding us at gunpoint while four others went hunting. The one lying here is a wounded mutineer. Our rough landing gave him a broken leg and either killed or seriously wounded the others in the crew, save for the four out hunting, the dead man, and us.\u201d\n\u201cThe four hunters are dead. They tried to fire on us. Do you five want to live?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Wolf and the Dollies said eagerly.\n\u201cWe can use the women,\u201d the man said. \u201cYou seem to be a fighter, even if you don\u2019t look it. What do you think happened to your ship?\u201d\n\u201cThe mutineers believed this an uninhabited planet. After we crashed, I heard them say that they were headed for a prairie and something dragged them down on the coast. I\u2019ve figured out that engineering and chemistry don\u2019t work here. Our only clothing that survived is cotton. Our water is in glass jugs, not plastic. I see that you have stone spear points and stone axes. The holes in the ship\u2019s hull and the crashes that have come from inside suggest that alloys aren\u2019t yet part of this environment, or that if they were, their molecular structure would be different.\u201d\n\u201cYou think better than we did, sir. We were aboard a military exploration vessel. Everything went wrong when we entered the atmosphere and it appears that our last message didn\u2019t make it out because the radio was dead. I\u2019m one of the few original survivors. We\u2019ll kill this mutineer and move away before your wreck disintegrates and starts leaking radiation, if radiation is natural to this planet. Your genes should be useful, so I hope you\u2019re fertile. We need good, young brains to grasp things youth have never seen. It isn\u2019t easy starting over while trying to maintain civilization.\u201d\nWhat happened next proved the speaker\u2019s point. The group speared the helpless Carter. Wolf hoped the Dollies drew the same lesson from the brutal killing that he did. This crowd didn\u2019t tolerate mutiny or dissent. Even dancers should be able to figure that out.\n|\n|\n______\n|\n||\n|\n______","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}

Now Nick observed what seemed to be a waterfall of fire stretching out to the extremes of vision in either direction.\n\u201cThreading appears to have been successful,\u201d he said, his words carried back to Earth in the same manner he and the capsule had been transported here. \u201cAll systems functioning normally. I\u2019ll begin running tests and report.\u201d\nThe pod was small, not much larger than his sky apartment back home, and most of it was dedicated to equipment. The era of large ships, miniature worlds contained in six steel walls, was now only a piece of data stored somewhere in humanity\u2019s historical records so far back that Nick had no idea such ships ever existed. Wormhole technology had made space exploration a safe, one-man job--in fact, his presence was a token gesture, posterity rather than necessity.\nSo Nick was more than a bit alarmed when the cabin door opened behind him. He swung around with a start and drew his weapon, thinking perhaps the Insiddians had smuggled an operative aboard to sabotage his mission.\nHe found instead an old man with white hair and a long beard. His face was stern, but his eyes twinkled with a thinly veiled humour.\n\u201cWell done,\u201d the old man said, \u201cyou\u2019ve achieved everything there is to achieve in the universe.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Who are you?\u201d Nick barked.\n\u201cI\u2019m God,\u201d God said. \u201cAnd I must say, I\u2019m very proud of you humans. Just a shade under eighty thousand years to go from creation to apotheosis. The reptile race over in dimension four still hasn\u2019t achieved powered flight and the Fazinians keep wiping themselves out with atomic weapons--they\u2019ve had to restart three times now. Oh, and don\u2019t get me going on the Moronians. They\u2019ve spent the past three thousand years trying to wipe out their \u2018mortal enemies\u2019, the Croznians. Just wait till they find out the Croznians aren\u2019t even real! Only one race, the Protonians, beat you here--and they have the advantage of silicon-based brains.\u201d\nNick gradually lowered his weapon. \u201cYou\u2019re really God?\u201d\n\u201cWho else would bother to meet you at the edge of the universe? There\u2019s not much to see out here. The firewall is pretty the first time you see it, but it gets rather boring after the first hour.\u201d\n\u201cMy God,\u201d Nick said. \u201cOh, fuck, sorry.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Nick, that \u2018name in vain\u2019 thing was just part of the test. Actually, that\u2019s why the Protonians got here faster than Humans--they saw through all that religion hogwash in ten generations.\u201d\nNick took a few groggy steps backwards and fell into his seat. \u201cSo . . . what now? Does this mean humans have become gods as well?\u201d\nGod laughed good-naturedly. \u201cHardly. This is only the first level. When you return, the rules will start to change. Things will be quite a bit more difficult.\u201d\n\u201cThings like what?\u201d\n\u201cNow, that would be telling, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d God said, grinning impishly. \u201cSuffice to say this one\u2019s going to be a time trial of sorts. Just go back and let everyone know I\u2019m very proud of them, but there\u2019s still quite a long way to go yet.\u201d\n#\nNick returned to Earth and told his superiors what he had found at the edge of the universe. He also relayed God\u2019s message to them, encouraging them to pass it on to the media. His superiors looked at each other and suggested he take some time off, ideally somewhere secluded and quiet where the media, or indeed anyone with a pair of ears, would be difficult to find.\nNick agreed to the first part of their suggestion and went home. The apartment was just as he left it--neat to the point of Spartan and sunlit twenty-four hours a day (which justified the astronomical rent he paid each month). After he had unpacked his things, Nick went into the kitchen and got a glass from the cupboard. He put the glass under the tap and pulled the mixer handle up. Nothing. He waggled the tap handle up and down and back and forth, but still nothing happened. Probably the fucking water company had interpreted his absence as death and cut off his supply. Grumbling to himself, he went to the fridge and got lucky with an ancient bottle of lemonade. He unscrewed the cap and tipped it up to the glass, but nothing came out. The lemonade was frozen, no doubt due to its refrigerated solitude during his three months of service at Wormhole Enterprises. He put the bottle on the sunny window sill and went into the lounge room to wait. He switched on the viewscreen and picked the movie channel, but fell asleep a few minutes later.\nWhen he woke, the clock in the corner of the viewscreen said it was nearly eight o\u2019clock at night. Nick got up and wandered into the kitchen, his mouth now as arid as the desert planet of Hydraxia. He grabbed the bottle off the sill and tried to pour himself a drink, but the lemonade was still a solid bulb at the bottom.\nGod\u2019s words echoed inside Nick\u2019s head as he stared at the crystallised lump inside the blue plastic. He put the bottle down on the bench and scuttled back out to the television. \u201cChannel twelve,\u201d he said urgently.\n\u201c. . . left thousands of vessels stranded in a sea of ice. Experts are at a loss to explain the phenomenon.\u201d\n\u201cAll we know,\u201d said a scientist captioned as Hugh McConskey, \u201cis that the melting point of water has risen dramatically. Early tests suggest it may be as high as one hundred and fifty degrees Celsius.\u201d\n\u201cOff,\u201d said Nick, a small smile creeping onto his lips. His short-lived holiday was over. It was time to return to the institute and have another conversation with his superiors. He thought they might be a little less dismissive this time around. There were some changes afoot, and he alone in the universe knew why.\nNick tried to grab his unit\u2019s keypass off the coffee table but only succeeded in flicking it onto the floor. The smile expanded to a grin as he wondered how the human race would cope sans thumbs. He bent down and scissored the keypass between his middle and index fingers, pondering with a black mirth how certain post-toilet ablutions would be performed under this new arrangement. On the plus side, of course, it would break a millennia-long, environmentally unfriendly practice.\nAt the entrance to the skypark, Nick swiped his pass and stepped on the travelator, which whisked him to his car in space A42. As he got in and started it up, he was glad water-powered engines had never got a foothold in the market before off-planet drilling had begun.\nFunctional cars had done little to stem the chaos, he soon discovered, with smoke plumes already curling up from the terrestrial cities below and orange flames licking the outside of some of the sky apartments he passed. The giant billboard that stretched between the Coke and McDonald\u2019s corporate skybuildings flickered distorted images of hamburgers and soft drinks (which presumably were now frozen in their dispensers). Swarms of skycars dipped and darted in all directions, right-of-way regulations now adhered to in only the most cursory manner. It was understandable; controlling a skycar\u2019s joystick with fingers alone required swift intuition and lot of dexterity.\nHalf an hour of near misses and emergency detours later, Nick manoeuvred his vehicle through the small door that opened into the Wormhole Enterprises skypark. Unlike the outside world, here they had retained some level of order and idle skycars stood in militaristic rows, Nick\u2019s space right where it had always been.\nThe chairman of Wormhole Enterprises, Clark Mange, met Nick at the skypark exit door. The last time Nick had seen him, Clark had sported a full head of brown hair--slicked backwards, as was the style among young entrepreneurs. Now he was totally bald and a mean red rash splotched his scalp.\n\u201cMy brand of hair oil is now acidic,\u201d Clark said, to parry Nick\u2019s inquisitive look. \u201cOh, and just for your information, most breath freshening products now taste and smell like faeces.\u201d\n\u201cThanks for the tip,\u201d Nick said. He tried to give Clark the thumbs up. They both stared at his curled fingers for a moment.\n\u201cUh . . . anyway, now it\u2019s time for you tell us everything you know,\u201d Clark said, leading Nick into the basement of the facility.\n\u201cI already did that, remember?\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes, but we didn\u2019t pay much attention. We thought the trip back through the wormhole must have disengaged your brain or something. I had Emerson insulating us against any legal recourse until his shoes came to life and started dragging him across the office. Seems certain synthetic products are now organic and sentient by traditional measures.\u201d\nClark ushered Nick into the wormhole lift. \u201cBesides which\u201d--he pressed a button and his words continued on the two-hundredth floor--\u201cthe president of the World Council got wind of your . . . shall we say omnipotent . . . experience and has demanded a full debriefing.\u201d\nThey entered the WE control room, which resembled a small stadium with one wall devoted to a fly-eye mesh of viewscreens. Usually they showed the imperceptible twirl and shift of deep space, but now, thanks to the swift dispatch of some wormhole cameras, they had been jury-rigged to display the current events of two hundred cities. The bigger metropolises appeared much the same as one another, all belching smoke and wild with scrambling, rioting citizens. One screen showed a North African farmer pondering how to handle his cattle now that their hides bristled with rows of cactus-like spines.\nLeaning against a rail, his eyes darting around the screens like hot atoms, was the president. He wore a small remote headset. \u201cScreen fifty-eight!\u201d he shouted in Esperanto-flavoured English. \u201cGet some troops to bring those birds down now!\u201d\nNick\u2019s eyes went to screen fifty-eight. As best he could tell, ostriches were no longer flightless and had developed a taste for human flesh.\n\u201cMr Xenedes,\u201d Clark said timidly, \u201cthis is the man we told you about. Nick Idel.\u201d\n\u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake, how can you miss an eight-foot bird? Get me some real marksmen!\u201d The president turned to look at Nick. \u201cDo you mean to tell me there\u2019s a method to this madness?\u201d\nNick shrugged. \u201cI suppose it has its own funny logic.\u201d\nPresident Xenedes\u2019 face went blank as he listened to something in his headset. \u201cWe\u2019ve just had word in from Australia--apples are now explosive. Alert the media.\u201d\nClark looked horrified. \u201cStinger Jenkins!\u201d he cried, and dashed for the nearest wormhole lift.\n\u201cStinger Jenkins?\u201d the president said, arching an eyebrow.\n\u201cHe\u2019s in accounts,\u201d Nick explained. \u201cStickler for routine. At exactly the same time every day, he eats an apple for afternoon tea.\u201d Nick checked his watch. \u201cClark\u2019ll have to hurry.\u201d\n\u201cGod, this is ridiculous. General, relieve me.\u201d\nA large man with muttonchop sideburns took up the president\u2019s post and immediately began barking orders. The president removed his earpiece and shook his head as if to clear it of voices. \u201cLet\u2019s go somewhere quiet where we can talk.\u201d\nNick led the president to a small meeting room squirrelled away in the corner of the control station. They sat down at opposite sides of the table, and Nick recounted his trip to the edge of the universe as best he could. The president nodded the whole time, as if humouring the babblings of a village idiot.\nWhen Nick was done, the president sat back and folded his arms. \u201cSo what was he like? God I mean?\u201d\n\u201cSeemed a nice old fella,\u201d Nick said. \u201cBit of a devilish sense of humour though, I think.\u201d\nAt that moment there was a knock at the door and a pasty-looking Clark walked in and sat down with a huff.\n\u201cHow did it go?\u201d Nick asked.\n\u201cTerrible. I\u2019ve never seen such a mess. Bits of apple and Stinger all over the place. The janitor-bots are going to have a hell of a time.\u201d\n\u201cSo you think this is all a test? That life itself is a game of skill?\u201d\nNick shrugged again. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard God\u2019s words now, so you can interpret them however you want, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what about the \u2018time trial\u2019 bit? What do you think he meant by that?\u201d\n\u201cI really have no idea,\u201d Nick said, folding his arms and crossing his legs irritably. His eyes widened. \u201cWait . . . maybe I do.\u201d\nClark and the president lened forward, their eyes receptive and expectant of a biblical revelation.\n\u201cAm I the only one now short a pair of testicles?\u201d\nKris Ashton is a Sydney-based author who does most of his writing in a train carriage.

Coffee splashed as both Davis and I lunged to our feet and tripped towards the door. I made it through first and darted out so fast I almost knocked my skull against the edge of the mech sitting in wait mode by the door.\n\u201cKeyed in.\u201d I heard him grunt from behind me.\nI wasn\u2019t about to wait for the information. It took forty-five seconds for the Pelican to cycle up, and we\u2019d been squatting on pavement for almost three hours. Our bird was crouched at the far edge of vertpad twelve, bay doors open and waiting for us.\nThe Pelicans are just what they sound like: ungainly looking vertical take-off and landing planes driven entirely by maneuverable jets. A wide bottomed undercarriage held the medical bay and room enough for fifteen bodies at full load. We were at full load more often than not.\n\u201cEngines on-line. All systems green.\u201d I told my partner as he closed the bay doors and I eased back on the joystick.\nHe wasn\u2019t paying any attention to me as he ran through his own pre-flight checklist; cardiac monitors on stand-by, IV fluids in line and flowing, and plenty of coag warm in their bags. \u201cI\u2019m go.\u201d\n\u201cRoger that.\u201d The Pelican thrust her body up off the vertpad without any elegance. She looked more like a bird that should have become wingless, and in truth, she became airborne through sheer power. But she was the stanchion of an Ambulance Corps that couldn\u2019t get through the gridlock of the Hub in standard four wheel ambulances. \u201cUnit Fiver-Two in the air.\u201d I broadcast to the tower.\n\u201cRoger that, Fiver-Two. Be advised, you are the only unit responding to this ten car.\u201d\nI frowned. We were three miles from the accident and heavy traffic was slowing despite mechs working to reroute vehicles through the overpasses. Every mile a vertpad jutted out from the concrete bypass like a red-flagged skin tag. The pads were reserved for our Pelicans, but more and more often they were standing empty, a victim of budget cuts even when the traffic kept getting worse.\nAt least the weather was nice. I don\u2019t usually have a preference, but I\u2019ll be the first to admit, at least to myself, that cold weather makes my prosthetic hand and leg ache something terrible.\nI know it\u2019s psychosomatic, but it still hurts. It hurts too when I see the remains of shuttle jumpers spread across one hundred feet of pavement, but I keep that to myself, the psychdocs don\u2019t need the work.\nIt\u2019s an effort to remind myself that not every accident is the result of a shuttle jumper. Once you\u2019ve lived through one, it\u2019s all you think of. Falls which are the exception, rather than the rule, in a sport that is our rebellion against traffic and the Hub. Youths outfitted with the same mag-grips that we wear in the Corps. They are designed to help medics crawl across mangled wreckage but they work equally well on those jumping from car to shuttle. Unless you miss, then nothing but luck and pavement hold your future.\nI can feel my eyes start to pinch from the memories, and I look back over the traffic, now completely stalled.\nDavis is on it immediately. \u201cCentral, this is Fiver-Two. Traffic is slowing into the Core. Additional two car collision at Artery Alpha One.\u201d\n\u201cCopy.\u201d The dry voice echoes through both our headsets. \u201cWe\u2019ll send a mech to check. Continue to the main accident.\u201d\n\u201cJumpers?\u201d Davis asked as he saw the tense set of my shoulders and came to the logical conclusion.\n\u201cNegative. Some idiot blew a tire.\u201d\nDavis looks back at me, and I don\u2019t need any psychic tendencies to peel away the layers. He\u2019s as glad as I am that there aren\u2019t any shuttle jumpers on this run. I can always hide my reaction until we get back to our small apartment just off the Hub, but it\u2019s hard.\nTen years ago I was spread across the pavement. The only reason I didn\u2019t die was that friction cauterized everything worth saving.\nI\u2019ve paid my dues to the concrete god, and I shouldn\u2019t owe these dying wounded anything. But it dredges up things from the bottom of my mind, regrets I\u2019ve sworn I don\u2019t have.\nA flick of my fingertips raps out a sharp stattaco beat just once before I catch myself. Bom-badda-badda-bom.\n\u201cThere it is.\u201d I\u2019m too shrill as I try to cover my slip.\nThe Pelican arcs toward the jam, but the ten-car estimate was too low. I can see almost twenty vehicles crumpled in the inner lanes. The mechs are already working, levering off doors and giving basic first aid, but a machine can only do so much.\n\u201cGet the kits.\u201d I shout to him as I bring the Pelican down. We touchdown, I slam the standby switch as Davis, and I head out the door simultaneously.\nThe Hub is a two hundred mile highway around the Core but that doesn\u2019t do it justice. Interchanges, arches, and overpasses weave in and out of the main flow in a surprisingly complex knot work of concrete highways. It\u2019s the only thing that can handle twenty-four hour rush hours as the three hundred million Hub-born commute to work. The politicians talk about installing a public transportation system based on the Core\u2019s perfect city without cars. It never gets very far because it costs more to build than the inconvenience is worth. After all, only Hub-born use the Hub. I guess the Core thinks it\u2019s our problem, and in a sense, they\u2019re right. No one forced us here, we walked willingly into the trap.\nAt the rear of the snarl, mechs shuttle traffic onto alternate routes all the way around the grid. In the midst of it, Davis and I work as fast as the mechs can cut drivers and passengers free. They slice through steel in seconds, and we\u2019re right behind them in triage.\nWe always start at the back of a lane because the likelihood for survivors is higher. We\u2019ve carted up twelve LOA civilians for transport to All Saints and I secure them onboard the Pelican as Davis tries to help a man that we\u2019ve triaged as non-salvageable. It\u2019s useless; he\u2019ll go with the rest of the DOAs on the mechs.\n\u201cOne minute.\u201d I key him in to lift-off.\n\u201cOn my way.\u201d\nI run through the abbreviated pre-flight even though my head hurts. I wouldn\u2019t be doing this job except that I have no choice. There\u2019s nothing else I can do. And I realize that my hand is doing it again. Bom-badda-badda-bom. Bom-badda-badda-bom.\nGod, I hate when it aches like that.\n2.\nI know this is a dream but I can\u2019t stop it.\nThe Hub has twelve lanes of driving traffic and three lanes of mass transit shuttles. The shuttles fly by at just over one hundred and twenty miles an hour. If you\u2019re on the roof of a car or van you hear the slight buzz as they come up and then overtake you. At those speeds you\u2019d think it would look faster but it doesn\u2019t.\nEvery jump is the same. It happens in stop time. One second you\u2019re waiting. And then you jump.\nThere\u2019s no time for prayer.\nThere\u2019s no time for contemplation.\nThere\u2019s no time to think.\nYou either land \u2013 or you don\u2019t.\nI\u2019ve known what awaits me since I was five years old; vocational training in the medical profession. I was gene-typed at birth for aptitude, and that diagnosis is one that won\u2019t change. Everyone around me is the same. No matter what we think, our futures are set. It works better for the Core to have a certain supply of workers, because that\u2019s our purpose, to serve them.\nSo why did some crazy kid dream up shuttle jumping? Uncertainty, chance, choice \u2013 take your pick.\nI\u2019m in position for this jump. And if we land it we\u2019ll make the news from the Fields to the Core. How much more notoriety can you ask for?\nIt was my fault since the idea was mine, but Rack, as my jumping partner of three years, had egged me on to try the impossible. One base jump from car to shuttle. Then lunging across five feet of shuttle roof and jumping to the next shuttle. Another roof run and that last jump. We\u2019re playing the odds which are completely against us. No one has ever jumped more than two.\nWhen you\u2019re young, you believe in the impossible. I\u2019ve heard kids say that if they work hard enough they\u2019ll make it into the Core, but later you realize the Core exists in isolation; Hub-born don\u2019t belong there any more than we\u2019d accept Field-born into our inner suburban circles.\nThis is how I know it is a dream. That day I didn\u2019t think like this. That day I was alive with possibilities. A jump we trained five months for. If it was possible, we were the ones who\u2019d do it.\nI dialed down the mag-grips on my sneakers, too much would slow me down but not enough and I\u2019d slide right off. Bom-badda-badda-bom. Bom-badda-badda-bom. The shuttles were coming. My counting beat was not Rack\u2019s, he used a weird I-have-to-if-I-want-to-and-there\u2019s-no-coming-back. The words always distracted me. Beats were what gave me wings.\nThe shuttle was there. I jumped. Two seconds. Bom-bom. And skittered and slid as I landed.\nBadda-badda-bom. Bom-bom- Jump!!!\nI made the second shuttle milliseconds ahead of Rack.\nThere are three feet of clearance between every shuttle. But each shuttle is different. You have to know how to judge them. You have to hope that one errant rock won\u2019t slip from beneath your shuttle and throw you off. You always need extra clearance and the only way to get it is to run faster, jump harder, and stretch out every single inch of your body. That\u2019s why the beats help. You\u2019d better be psyched since there are no prizes for second best in this race. You jump your best until you\u2019re done.\nThird jump. I lost the beat.\nBut I made it \u2013 hanging with one shoe on the roof and both hands clinging to wind-blown metal. The mag-grips in my gloves screaming as I tried to dial them up with will-power alone. It doesn\u2019t matter. Even in my dream the shuttle goes bouncing over that single stone.\nStop time clarifies everything but even in my dream I turn away from the memories.\nIn the end I\u2019m not upset that I missed the jump. It\u2019s the beat that I lost to the darkness that made me angry. A flat silence that sucked the life right out of me.\nI, at least, woke up. Rack never did. He\u2019d been hit by the group of shuttles that followed our own before he was bounced into traffic. At his funeral I stood outside but didn\u2019t go in. It\u2019s bad luck to look at road-kill. It could have been me.\n3.\n\u201cLast load in.\u201d The shift manager patted me on the back as I stepped past him with a load of empty gurneys, equipped with hover power, they are as integral as the Pelicans. We\u2019d never survive if we had to haul every body off the Hub. Between one and two hundred accidents a day wears out the toughest medic.\n\u201cYou want to get a beer?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d Davis grabbed me by the hand before I could agree. \u201cWe have plans.\u201d\nThe shift manager cocked one eyebrow at us. The grey hairs woven through the black did a little dance of disbelief. He\u2019d always thought that we were a poor match.\n\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d I asked him as he pulled me out of the station.\n\u201cCome on.\u201d\nDavis is a good partner. We passed our medical exams in the same class and worked well together. It was natural that we partner together in our professional and personal lives. Neither of us questioned it. But there were times that I wished he understood what I\u2019d lost.\nHe wouldn\u2019t talk to me, not through the nine o\u2019clock rush hour traffic. After flying the Pelicans it was hard to get back onto the Hub. The traffic grated on us and every little jerk of another car made both of us twitch like the accident was already happening. They say that medics are the best drivers on the Hub. Makes you wonder if every citizen shouldn\u2019t do a stint in the Ambulance Corps.\nHe still hadn\u2019t answered me as we changed clothes in our apartment. There isn\u2019t a lot of room for quiet in a four hundred square foot apartment but he found the space for it. I gave up after twenty minutes and stretched out with my false foot propped on a sofa while he finished in the bathroom.\nThe leg looks pretty good just like my hand does. It\u2019s built of a plastic composite that looks natural except where it reflects the light. I can\u2019t argue. During rehabilitation they showed me pictures of old fashioned prosthetics made of steel and non-linked electronics. They always showed those pictures on the worst days when I wished I\u2019d rolled under the wheels of the shuttle instead of just fell from one.\nI can still run although I limp where the prosthetic chafes against the nub I\u2019ve got left. I rarely go to the track though. Ten years have passed, yet every year that I can handle the accident a little bit better, green envy takes a firmer hold of my heart. The things I used to be able to do beat at me and eat away the edges of my patience. I used to be the best, and it burns so much that I\u2019m relegated to a has-been with lots of war stories and yet no glory to carry around with me.\n***\n\u201cSeela?\u201d I hear his voice as he steps back out of the bathroom.\nI don\u2019t want to answer. There\u2019s a beat bumping in the back of my head and I want to draw it out to its logical conclusion. Maybe I wasn\u2019t ever a shuttle jumper for the adrenaline of the jump but because I\u2019m addicted to the rhythms in my head. In another life I might have been a musician until my genes betrayed me.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I respond peckishly.\n\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d I lurch upwards and place my prosthetic foot on the floor. He\u2019s watching me with worried eyes, and I want to tell him that things are coming to a head now. The dreams are a new thing, but maybe he already knows. Davis always did understand me better than anyone except Rack.\n***\nIn hindsight, it should have been clearer. Motives drive all of us. They drove us into the Metroplexes, for safety and security when nothing on the outside would protect us. We built the Cores, and the rich crawled into them. The Hubs grew up around the Cores as employees needed places to eat, live and shit that was close - but not too close - to the wealthy inner circle. And as we solidified into suburban strongholds we exiled the only ones we could, those even lower than us, out to the dangerous Fields.\nI\u2019ve never been to the Fields; no one I know has. Life out there is worse than the Hub. Here your greatest chance of dying occurs during the daily commute. Out there diseases strip the DNA right out of your cells and life expectancy hovers at thirty-five. Sure they provide us with agricultural commodities but the common consensus is always that we\u2019d be better off without them.\nWe\u2019d be better off without the Hub too, but no one is voting to fire bomb it.\nMotives drive the world. My motives were somewhat dingy and tarnished by life. I wanted to work and flying the Pelican was the closest thing to a future I could envision. I\u2019d fly that bird until she fell out of the sky and hope they gave me another one. No grander visions assailed me. I didn\u2019t want to worry about not attaining them.\nSo Davis\u2019 question during dinner didn\u2019t just shock me. It was so far out of the question that I couldn\u2019t even answer him. A baby?\nAfter my own youth inside the Hub did I really want to bring another life into that endless cycle? Round and round, just like a spin around the Hub. Have a baby, raise it up to live the exact same life you\u2019ve led, one with a future already delineated. No moving forward or back once you were on the route. Just around, and around, and around. A swishing falsetto beat that I don\u2019t like. Beats should be straightforward, bass with a little bit of snare to drive the tempo.\nHe didn\u2019t like my answer, and I found myself sleeping at the station for the first time since we partnered together. I traded my dress for something more comfortable but I could still feel my prosthetic. A solid haunting from my past.\nI\u2019d once had a dream that was something different than a 9-to-5 supporting the Core. But what made that a bad dream? I worried that over and over in my head. What made it a bad dream?\n\u201cSeela!!\u201d A voice broke my reverie.\nI hear it before she says anything else, the tiny drone that precedes every alarm. This one is going off all across the station. Every team, off-duty or not, turns toward the com as the data is keyed in to those of us listening.\nA big accident during the four a.m. rush \u2013 really big. At least eight shuttle jumpers confirmed dead and mechs were unable to catalog the extent of it. Every lane was compromised. I didn\u2019t hesitate as I ran for my Pelican.\nI have enough bad dreams.\n4.\nI slip as I climb over the crumpled hoods of seven vehicles smashed together, and pause to dial up the mag-grips on my sneakers. Falling onto the mass below me will add another injured to the hundreds we\u2019re evac\u2019ing out.\nConcrete and twisted steel have macerated the occupants of the cars between them. Even the fail-safe electrical systems in the hybrids have failed, and I can smell gasoline burning as ozone sparks under the charge. Underneath the charcoaled odor are the screams of those conscious enough to feel pain. Cacophony doesn\u2019t cover the chaos around us, and chaos doesn\u2019t do it justice. This accident drips and bleeds with surreal abundance.\nThe collision has compacted this lane, and I try to reduce everything to clinical precision as I lurch over the smashed remnant of a body impaled upward. You can\u2019t think about it any other way or the psychdocs will have you drugged so far out that you think you\u2019re the next Messiah. A little bit of distance is the only saving grace in the Hub. I check for life, but when you can see the piece of metal that severed the aortic artery still protruding, it\u2019s a measure of futility.\nThis accident is the worst I\u2019ve ever seen. Pelicans on every vertpad for eight miles. Every Medical Center in the Hub is on alert and we\u2019re loading up patients as fast as stand-by pilots can fly them out. There have been rumors over the open frequency that we\u2019ll have to use mechs for LOAs unless we can get more teams in to help.\nI\u2019m slapping flatline decals on almost every car. The accident didn\u2019t spare anyone. And the futility of it hammers into me. There\u2019s nothing here to save.\nIt takes a bit of work to make it to the shuttle lanes. This is where we ferry the wounded, and there are teams everywhere trailing their sad baggage. A paramedic runs past me, and her last patient is so bad that blood is spilling off the gurney in fat arterial chunks. I turn to tell her, but she already knows.\nI jog toward the front of the chaos, and it\u2019s here, almost two hundred feet back when I see the smear that freezes the breath in my throat.\nFor a minute I forget where I am and remember the first time I saw a jumper die. A girl named Tweak when we were all just thirteen and I was still new to jumping. She\u2019d missed her landing and cracked her skull against the shuttle as it passed her. Her only saving mercy was that she was dead before she hit the pavement.\nI saw her die and still jumped because it was the only unknown left to us. The only dream we were allowed.\nThis accident is worse than Tweak\u2019s death. They aren\u2019t even comparable when Pelicans fly so close that their jets spray hair across my face. The sky is full of them and I hope to god that Air Traffic Control is on top of their game. The last thing we need is burning planes dropping from the sky.\nThe second shuttle ran into the one just ahead of it for reasons you can\u2019t tell from looking at the twisted wreckage. Maybe the driver saw the jumper in his mirror and tried to use a burst of speed to get away; it had happened before. Maybe the jumper surprised him so much that he lost control. I\u2019d never be able to ask him as there was a huge flatline decal stamped across what was left.\nThere were a few medics clustered around one of the bodies on the pavement. Four of us who saw a young first-timer trying to patch the body of a jumper who might as well be dead.\nIt only took a few seconds for the others to drift back into the frenetic flow of the accident while I stayed with her.\n\u201cBag him while I stop the bleeding.\u201d She pleaded.\nI looked down. My medical training saw the corded muscle of his only limb where the road had flayed his clothes and skin right off of him. What was left was the body of a jumper, finely corded muscular fibers, now burnt black by friction. The other limbs were gone with pressure tourniquets bound in their place.\nBut that wasn\u2019t what she was seeing. This wasn\u2019t just another patient, but a young man with the remnants of a pink Mohawk above what used to be his face. He hadn\u2019t been as lucky as me. Friction and sheering had deprived him of his limbs but hadn\u2019t stopped the bleeding. He was dying.\nHis left eye had been obliterated but the other rolled toward me, and I was amazed that he was still conscious. Amazed and awed. Either he had phenomenal self-control or the pain was so great that his mind simply shut it down. I hoped for the latter.\nI crouched down beside him so that he wouldn\u2019t have to fight to focus.\n\u201cIf you jump, you jump just a little bit farther. If you stretch, you stretch just a little bit longer.\u201d I said softly to him as the medic cursed me. I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her that he would appreciate this more than saving him.\nTears welled up in that good eye and mixed with blood before they lost their battle to gravity and cascaded down his cheek.\nMy hand was on his chest, the prosthetic one, and I gently rapped out the beat that had guided me so long ago. Not fast like I was waiting for a shuttle, but a slow dirge waiting for the end. Booom-baaa-da-baaa-da-booom. Booom-baaa-da-baaa-da-booom. These were the things that he understood.\nIt was only chance that had brought me here, but I was glad it had happened. Booom-ba--booom--baaa---boooo\u2026 His heartbeat faded under mechanical fingertips.\n\u201cIf you run,\u201d I told him. \u201cRun just a little bit faster.\u201d\n|\n|\n______\n|\n||\n|\n______","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}

I looked up from the ancient keyboard to the whitewashed steel door.\n\u201cHello?\u201d I called.\nNo response.\nStanding abruptly from the little workstation, I knocked the chair over backwards and it clattered on the tile. I crossed the small windowless room to the door and hesitated.\n\u201cHello?\u201d I called again, trying to sound calm.\nStill no response.\nI slipped the little hoop earring off leaned my ear against the door and listened for any indication of life. Silence.\nA tingling panic rose up in my chest. I could see no indication of a lock from this side. There was no slit of a keyhole. Smooth and dull.\nI gently touched the knob with my fingers and twisted and felt resistance. I grasped the knob harder and wrenched it side to side. The small metal ball was immovable. I slapped the door with the flat of my free hand as I continued to jerk and pull with the other. It was a solid door.\n\u201cHey! This isn\u2019t funny! Let me out! Ted! Colund!\u201d\nThe old dot-matrix printer beside the workstation sprang to life. The harsh mechanical whirring reminded me of a wood-chipper. I had wanted to print out some of the code I was working on earlier, but I couldn\u2019t find the driver in the directory. I had thought it was just a dead relic.\nI went over and pulled the printout back so that I could read it. The words were difficult to make out in the light of the single overhead bulb.\n\/\/*release is imminent*\/\/\n\u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d I yelled.\nI was getting paid by the hour, but not enough to be incarcerated in this little dungeon with this crazy computer.\nI pulled out a credit card and tried to slide it along the doorjamb. I had never unlocked anything doing this before but had seen it done on TV. I fumbled and dropped the card. The gap was too narrow, or maybe my hand was just shaking too hard. This was so bizarre.\nI took my Blackberry from the bag on the floor that I kept my laptop in. I might have sent an email or used the phone feature but there was no antenna signal. Not surprising this far down in the basement. I should have checked when I first came down here. Why had I taken this stupid job? Well, the money of course. But I knew as soon as I\u2019d seen this dank little room that the job was a bad idea.\nEarlier that afternoon, I had come from South Bay Tech Support, LLC to install a series of patches on the old Harbinger computer server. These machines had to be at least twenty-five years old, but they were still legendary in the industry. I had never worked on one before. I had never even seen one.\nI wasn\u2019t sure why they didn\u2019t have their own system administrator try to install the software and system upgrades. I guessed it was probably more cost effective for them to outsource. Everybody outsourced these days. That was the niche I had fallen into during my business school sabbatical. Forced sabbatical. Well actually when you withdraw because your professor is a fascist pig that can\u2019t recognize innovation they usually call it failing out. But I didn\u2019t look at it as the end. Rather it was just another opportunity for personal growth.\nAnyway, I did outsourced server upgrades. No benefits, but a nice hourly bill-out rate. When I was working. The Information Technology industry was a living hell, and admittedly, not what I thought it would be.\nI had been booked for six-thirty to midnight so that when I shut down the server no one would have to stop slaving away. It put a real dent into my social life, but I could put up with the odd hours to bill time and a half.\nWhen I had arrived I waited for almost twenty minutes, on the clock, at the guard kiosk. I tried to get a conversation going through the little slit in the guard\u2019s Plexiglas barricade, but after five monosyllabic replies I gave up and sat on the bench. I slipped my glasses on and waited. Not the cute cat\u2019s eyes, the thick birth-control ones I used for serious work.\nA slow nervous little man, in a rumpled brown suit jacket that was a size too big for him, finally came. As he introduced himself I couldn\u2019t help but think of a little boy in a life preserver.\nI followed him through the quiet office space, past rows of silent cubicles until we reached an office door. The black plastic nameplate read \u2018Mr. Colund, IT Manager.'\nAt the desk inside sat an unhealthy-looking middle-aged man. Pale. Receding hairline. Deep lines carved at the corners of the tight, lipless seam of his mouth. White shirt with white socks to match, I bet. I wasn\u2019t sure, but I thought he smelled like Aquavelva.\nMr. Palid looked stressed; keeping a huge Defense Contractor\u2019s IT needs met. But he probably had a good benefits package. I would kill for a steady job with a good benefits package. After I finished an MBA, with the information systems management concentration. Well, started a new one and then finished it.\nThe little man introduced me. The cadaverous Mr. Colund gave me a flaccid, perfunctory handshake and a confused smile. I stood in an awkward silence. The old freak and his little toady made me uncomfortable.\nMr. Palid stared at my breasts and said, \u201cYou\u2019re a woman.\u201d\nGreat. Mr. Placid-perv was actually oogling me. Part of the reason I took this job was so that I didn\u2019t have to put up with this crap. Not needing to dress for success, I was wearing a baggy flannel shirt that did nothing to accentuate my figure, so what was he looking at anyway? Give me a break.\nI did that little dip, where my eyes drop down to catch his and pull them back up to my face and said, \u201cThank you for pointing that out.\u201d\nA little flush of red up his neck and he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry the agency said they would be sending a Tony Farragolo.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Toni with an \u2018i\u2019.\u201d\nMr. Palid-perv-preconceptionist looked down at the papers on his desk and said, \u201cI was expecting.\u201d And then he trailed off, realizing what he was about to say.\nI let out a breath and said, \u201cYou were expecting a man?\u201d\n\u201cNo. No, just the name.\u201d He paused, collected his thought as continued. \u201cWell, thank you for coming this evening. I\u2019m afraid the server has been acting up and I\u2019d like to see if you can\u2019t help with the installation of a little software patch.\u201d\nI thought his face would crack when he smiled.\nI didn\u2019t smile back, not wanting to give him encouragement. I\u2019m unfriendly, not coquettish, Mr. Perv.\nHis smile faded slowly, and he handed me an antique five and a half inch floppy disc. I hadn\u2019t seen one of these since third grade. I turned it over in my hand.\n\u201cThere is a brief tutorial on the operating system there. It shouldn\u2019t take you long.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a drive for this,\u201d I said holding the disc up.\n\u201cThe computer you\u2019ll use does,\u201d he said.\nI looked back at Ted, who didn\u2019t make eye contact and then said, \u201cI brought my laptop to link in through the USB port.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid you can\u2019t access the server through a USB port.\u201d Colund\u2019s expression shifted from flustered into impassive.\n\u201cI saw dozens computers on the network. I can just plug into the LAN through one of their ports and remote access the server.\u201d\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry. The only way to access the server is through the hard-wired interface. Ted, why don\u2019t you take Ms. Farragolo down to the access room.\u201d\nThe nervous little man didn\u2019t look up. He sighed and nodded slowly.\n\u201cCould you take me to see the hardware?\u201d I asked. I wanted to be able to tell my friends I had seen a Harbinger in the flesh.\nColund looked at Ted and shook his head.\nTed looked up at me, without making eye contact, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s proprietary.\u201d\n\u201cI have a signed a non-disclosure agreement on file.\u201d The whole point of using South Bay Tech was to get someone like me in to look at proprietary hardware and software.\n\u201cThe server is in the sub-basement,\u201d Ted said. He started to leave. It all seemed a little strange.\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind basements.\u201d\nTed looked back at Colund.\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t need to go there.\u201d\nTed turned to me and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to go there.\u201d\nGender bias, lasciviousness and Jedi mind powers. He was a package deal. This freak was going to get an entire post dedicated to him on my blog.\n\u201cThe access terminal is enabled with all the server permissions. Hard wired. Ted will escort you, and I will see you at midnight,\u201d Colund said.\nI followed Ted to the service elevator. One flight below the ground floor and down a deserted corridor. A light green discoloration to the industrial off-white paint hinted at mold taking root on the cinderblock walls.\n\u201cIt\u2019s warm down here.\u201d\nTed didn\u2019t respond. He stopped his slow cadence march down the hall and turned into a small room. It wasn\u2019t much larger than a broom closet and smelled musty. An ancient computer terminal and keyboard rested on a desk, which was the only furniture inside. An ancient printer beside it was coated in a thin layer of dust.\nTed explained that I would need to access the server through this terminal and that the floppy disc had the patch I needed to install already loaded. It seemed like easy money, if I could remember my elementary school computer skills.\nI placed my laptop bag on the floor beside the desk and sat at the terminal. Ted stood hesitantly in the doorway, and I contemplated getting my pepper-spray out of my bag. He was probably harmless. And if he wanted to see computer magic, he was in the right place.\nI sat at the workstation and reflexively cracked my knuckles. I brushed the keyboard and a single line blinked on the screen in response:\n\/\/*Pishacha is prepared*\/\/\n\u201cWhoa, there\u2019s some life in this old thing. Ted, is Pacha-Pachinco-whatever, is that the server\u2019s name?\u201d\nI turned when there was no answer. Ted had left, closing the door silently. These people really were freaks, and they were both earning some serious blog-space.\nI spent the next few hours working with the code, drinking back-to-back Jolt colas, warm, and listening to Rob Zombie on my iPod. I never realized there could be so much data on the old disc.\nThe older Harbinger server had an arcane relational database management system that overlaid what I might have mistaken as old Unix. It read like a Boyce table language, but it had some newer SQL commands mixed in. Anyway, it was difficult to troubleshoot, and every time I tried to enable the patch the system would fail and the screen would read:\n\/\/*Pishacha is unprepared*\/\/\nHarbinger, Inc was serious about their servers being magic. I went through the OS tutorial several times and was sure I had everything right. It was like the computer was stalling me. Or it had a mind of its own. Or maybe Mr. Placid-perv had a webcam and wanted to watch me struggle.\n\u201cWell Pachinco, I\u2019ve done all I can. It\u2019s getting late so one more round, and then I\u2019m calling it a night.\u201d\nA waft of moist warm air blew up my pant cuff and I jumped back. Under the desk against the wall was an air conditioner vent that I hadn\u2019t noticed before. The words \u2018Demon speed too fast for you\u2019 squealed at me. I flicked off the iPod and pulled the speakers from my ears.\nI leaned under the desk and could just hear the hum of machinery. And something else. Something wet. The air coming up through the vent smelled acidic but foul, like too-ripe tomatoes.\nI sat back up and took a deep breath.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Almost midnight.\u201d I billed by the hour, but I didn\u2019t get the bonus if the job wasn\u2019t done. For that I needed my performance evaluation signed.\nI cracked my knuckles again and started to enter more commands, and that\u2019s when I heard the door lock.\n***\nMy Blackberry read eleven-fifty PM. I had been here too long. And I had the feeling I was screwed. There was only one exit. There was no way I could get through that door unless it was unlocked. The vent looked too small. The walls were concrete blocks. As I looked around my cell, I noticed for the first time that the ceiling was made of drop-down panels.\nI put the chair on the desk while both cursing my short Sicilian genetics and praising my forethought at wearing flats. Then I scrambled up onto the chair and balanced while I pushed up a panel. The concrete ceiling left a space of just a few inches. Enough room for an air vent and the sprinkler, but not enough for even little old me to wiggle through.\nI heard a little metallic tap from under the desk. Then another. I shimmied down my teetering tower of furniture and looked on the floor. Nothing unusual. Then I noticed two little screws on the floor. As I watched, another screw fell to the floor and made a metallic tap on the tile. They had come from the corners of the vent grate.\nI watched as the fourth screw rotated counterclockwise of its own accord. And then it too plinked off the dusty tile. The grate was no longer secured, and it fell from the wall. I reflexively grabbed it half way to the floor. It shook violently in my trembling hand.\nThe sheet rock around the vent looked puckered. It reminded me of a fabricated sphincter. There were little flakes along the rough sides of the hole that looked like dried meat.\nI looked closer. A blood-soaked fingernail pulled out at the quick.\n\u201cOh, no. Oh-no, oh-no, oh-no.\u201d\nI could hear something moving deep in the vent hole. Metallic rattling. Something small sliding against smooth metal. Many somethings. I didn\u2019t like this at all. The rattle grew louder. Something was getting closer.\nI grabbed my pepper-spray with one hand and slammed the grate atop the hole with the other. I held it with both hands while the rattling continued. There was something just on the other side of the grate, but I couldn\u2019t see. Something brushed the other side. A rat? God, I hate rats. Maybe a snake? I hate snakes worse.\nMy hand, pressed against the little holes, was sliced. I pulled it back at the sharp pain and there was a thin, deep slash on the palm above a small rivulet of blood. Whatever was on the other side of the grate pushed full force, and I almost lost hold with my other hand. Then it was cut too.\nI switched off hands, trying to keep the vent from coming free and not get cut again. What the hell was back there? I pulled my feet up and pressed them against the grate. I had better leverage and I laid back.\n\u201cHelp!\u201d It was probably useless to yell, but I was pee-myself scared. I screamed it over and over again, trying not to sound too shrill.\nI felt the bottoms of shoes being nicked time and again. The pressure against my feet increased. The corner of the grate bucked and I moved my foot to keep it down. And then the other corner popped away. Whatever was back there started to thrash against the grate.\nI stared at the ceiling and tears started to blur my vision. This was so wrong. The sprinkler. It had a little heat indicator attached. I could start a fire and then the rescue team would come. I reached in my front pocket for my smokes and matches, forgetting that I had quit again.\n\u201cDamn!\u201d\nI tried to reach up on the desk but couldn\u2019t. I really needed to stop skipping my Pilates class. The grate pushed away, and I stomped it back against the wall slightly askew. From the slim gap at the corner a thin, headless black snake slid out. No, not a snake. It was a length of coaxial cable. There were thin slivers of copper wire poking out of the end where, if it had been a snake, the head should be. It waved back and forth.\nThen another slid out at the opposite askew corner. I kicked at them and lost my purchase on the barrier. The entire grate flew away as the hole expelled a Medusa's head of writhing black cables.\nThick strands of cable wrapped around my ankles and undulated up my thighs, twisted around my waist. Securely bundled, they dragged me into the hole that had seemed too small.\nI kicked. I screamed. I thrashed. I grabbed at the sides of the vent hole.\n\u201cPlease! Please-please-please.\u201d I laughed maniacally as I slid in through the puckered hole. My laughs degenerated into bubbling sobs.\nI tried desperately to hold on, but the pulling was irresistible. I slid in and down the vent. I snaked down through spaces almost too narrow for me. I bumped and scraped and left patches of skin and a few shirt buttons as I twisted downward toward the rotting tomato smell.\nThe confinement fell away all of a sudden. I fell out of the conduit onto a concrete floor. Exposed light bulbs dangling, girder ceiling, cinder-block walls, probably the sub-basement. I looked down between my feet in the direction I was being pulled.\nThe cables ran across the floor and up into a hole in the bottom of a huge server console. The console was dark and shiny. A sweaty mass that didn\u2019t want to be pressed into the shape of a server rack.\nMy pace was the same, but I felt a greater urgency being this close. In the dim light it was hard to tell, but it looked like the hole in the console dilated. The corners pulled up and made that hole look like a leering grin. Twelve feet to go.\nColund sat to the left of the server typing into an antique PC, a twin of the one I had been using. He looked over his shoulder and down at me.\n\u201cHelp me!\u201d I screamed and twisted. I tried to scramble up into a sitting position. Ten feet.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve almost finished the server upgrade, Toni with an \u2018i\u2019,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t turn from the keyboard and continued to type.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I screamed. Eight feet. The hole at the bottom of the server console dilated open and then closed. Snick. Snick. I couldn\u2019t help but think of a dog snapping at a treat it was about to receive.\n\u201cPishacha is one of our older servers. Enslaved in the early nineteenth century, but a use wasn\u2019t found for him until Harbinger, Inc. started turning these little devils into the most advanced computer servers on the planet. He\u2019s the fusion of demonology and cybernetics, a perfect union, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\u201cHelp me,\u201d I cried. Five feet. I didn\u2019t want to sound so girly. I cleared my throat; tears streamed down my face.\n\u201cYou\u2019re serving a greater good here. Harbinger is bidding a Department of Defense contract, and we need all of our servers in top form. War on terror and all that.\u201d While he typed he made cooing sounds to the machine-thing.\nTwo feet.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s any consolation, I\u2019ll give you a very favorable assessment on your performance evaluation.\u201d\nMy feet slid up to the lip of the open hole. I could see now that it really was a mouth. A terrible bubbling feeling welled up in me.\nI thrashed side to side and could just touch one of the little wheels on the bottom of Colund\u2019s chair. I bucked again and was able to grab the base of the chair, above the wheels with both hands. I used the force that dragged at me to tip Colund over on top of me.\nHe squawked.\nI shimmied and twisted and pushed him down toward my feet. Then I remembered the pepper-spray and shot ejected the contents into Colund\u2019s surprised face.\nHis hands shot to his face, and he kicked his feet for purchase. This caused him to scoot closer to the server. More wet black cables snaked out of the server and flailed blindly. They swept across Colund\u2019s tear-wet, red face. He started to brush the cables away one handed, and they wrapped and twisted around his wrist.\nMore cables emerged and swept gently across the twisting old man\u2019s face. Then they wrapped quickly around his head and neck. Colund let out a muffled scream and went rigid. The cables loosened their hold on me, and I scrambled away.\nColund\u2019s head and shoulders disappeared. A spasm rippled through his lower body. The edges of the hole reached out as the man was pulled in. It reminded me of a little kid sucking down a wet spaghetti noodle.\nThe whole body was gone in an instant. I sat on the floor listening to the wet crunching sounds. Then silence.\nI sat there with my back against the far wall. An old dot-matrix printer, identical to the one I had seen in the little room sprang to life. I walked cautiously to the printer, pepper-spray ready, and read:\n\/\/*maintenance cycle complete*\/\/\n***\nI was going over the server comparison sheets when Ted brought the new consultant into my office. After I had cleaned out Colund\u2019s stuff, I got one of the old Harbinger Inc, posters out for my wall. The slogan read: Our servers are magic.\nTrue, but demonic would be more accurate. It was amazing how much information the various Harbinger models could handle. Aside from the occasional human sacrifice, they were a lot more economical than any other system on the market. It would probably be another twenty years before the industry could produce a competitive alternative.\nThe board had offered me a full-time position with a competitive salary and benefits package after I\u2019d fed Colund to the demon, without having to go back for my MBA. Feeding the old guy to the demon didn\u2019t bother me too much. I mean, he knew that\u2019s how the tech industry works.\nTed looked down at the floor and fidgeted.\nI looked at the new consultant and said, \u201cThank you for coming this evening. I\u2019m afraid our server\u2019s been acting up and we could use your help.\u201d\nThe IT business really is Hell.\nRichard Farnsworth is a scientist by day, a soldier on weekends with an aspiring scifi writer squeezed in there somewhere. This is his first work of fiction.\n|\n|\n______\n|\n||\n|\n______","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}

Across the river that separates them from us, I see my sister. She is crouched on her haunches, and I know that she\u2019d come to me, but for the river.\nA strip of fog hovers over that thin sliver of water. It is spring, slouching into summer, and all of us on this side are afraid that the river will dry up and the ones on the other side will cross. My sister raises her head and looks at me ,and I lift my hand in a gesture of acknowledgment. She stretches her lips in a grimace and howls.\nHer howl is joined by a chorus of other howls and more Shamblers come out of the woods. They line up against the riverbank, still as stones, except for the sounds they make. I turn my back on my sister because I can\u2019t stand to see her with them. As I walk back to my car I see others like me standing sentinel along our side of the riverbank. They\u2019re hoping to see loved ones come out of the woods and look across at them with some sign of recognition of a life once lived. Like me, these watchers will be disappointed.\n\u201cHello, Andrea,\u201d I say to a tired-looking woman who\u2018s walked up behind me. She smiles at me and smooths her house dress, which is rucked up under the coat she\u2019s thrown on too hastily. She\u2019s doubtless just come from preparing a meal for her second husband and his children. I\u2019ve asked her why she doesn\u2019t let them order take-out on occasion. She enjoys the distraction, she\u2019s told me. She used to be a nuclear physicist - there was so much pressure. She enjoys being a housewife now.\nShe says this with all the conviction of an inveterate liar.\nAndrea tells me again that she\u2019s happy now, though tears stream down her cheeks when she sees her child in the arms of his father among the Shamblers. She presses a trembling hand to her lips. \u201cI know I should let go,\u201d she says. \u201cI know it wasn\u2019t my fault, that there was nothing I could have done. Nothing I can do.\u201d\nShe turns to me, an expression of horror in her eyes. \u201cBut it\u2019s killing me. I play these awful games. I tell myself I might bring one of them back if I could choose between them. And each time, in my mind, I choose my husband over my son. That must be why I\u2019m being punished. That must be why I\u2019ve lost both of them.\u201d\nShe weeps silently into her trembling hand, and I pat her on the shoulder awkwardly. \u201cThere, there, Andrea,\u201d I murmur. \u201cWe can\u2019t help our thoughts. I know you love them both.\u201d While I stand there awkwardly, I hear Shepherd calling across for his dog, Jolie. \u201cHere, girl! Here, girl.\u201d He whistles to her as if he expects her to come bounding across that strip of water. I don\u2019t tell him that the Shamblers may have eaten her. I expect he knows that. I expect we all know how brutal life is on the other side.\nI say goodnight to Andrea and get in my car. I drive back to the village and present my security card to the guard at the citadel, and he opens the gates to let me drive through. Our village is designed like a medieval fortress in case the Shamblers find out they can swim or the summer heat evaporates the river and gives the Shamblers a path across. A moat surrounds our citadel. We pump water for the moat from an underground stream that feeds from the river. If the Shamblers come, we will burn the bridge that leads inside. The moat is twenty feet across and ten feet deep. We suspect it isn\u2019t wide enough or deep enough.\nThese are things we fear: the demise of the stream, the coming of summer, changes in the way the Shamblers behave, our own natures. It is accurate to say that we live in fear.\nInside the gates, I find my bungalow, which looks like most of the bungalows on my street. The village is a \u201cplanned community\u201c and all of the bungalows meet strict community norms. I\u2019m in a model called the Rose Cottage and deeply embarrassed that I bought it. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking, except that my sister would like it. I am here for her - she\u2019s the reason I decided to live in the Danger Zone. I have the money, after all, to move further inland where the housing costs skyrocket and the village walls are more fortified. Security measures inland are inversely proportional to actual risk and directly proportional to wealth.\nIn the Danger Zone, we make do with feeble measures and false hopes: Destitute or bereft, we cling to the normalcy of old suburban dreams.\nI move into the living room and log into my notebook, which is still open on the coffee table. I bring it to my lap and start working on my column, \u201cRiver News.\u201d It will get posted as soon as I write it. People are hungry for news and for warnings of incursions across the river. They want to know if they will have to pack up and leave again. If the mass killings start again, can we find another section of the river that\u2019s safer? Will the townships upriver let us in?\nMy readers also want to hear about the mercenaries crazy enough to go across into Shambler territory. Expecting gold for slaughter, these hardened men and women imagine they are smarter and faster and more brutal than those pathetic specimens who cling to the river line. There is usually little to say about this. Most go across and are not heard from again.\nOccasionally, we see these mercenaries on the shoreline, stopped by the river from returning. They look bewildered - shocked that they\u2019ve been bested. Occasionally, one comes back, though if he looks even the little bit off, we shoot him. Lately, it takes very little to look \u201cjust a little bit off.\u201d\nOnce, a mercenary came back with a specimen of a Shambler - a severed hand. We took it to Dr. Phlock, the geriatric Mengele in our village who claims to be an expert on abnormal pathologies. He injected some of the Shambler cells into one of the neighborhood cats. We had to put the cat down of course, but we got to it after it had already bitten a child. The child\u2019s mother took the child across the river herself.\nAndrea, Shepherd, and I were there that night. We watched the woman stumble across the narrow divide when the child woke up and sank his fangs into his mother\u2019s shoulder. The woman\u2019s transformation was so rapid, she sank into the river almost immediately, dragging the shrieking toddler with her. Both disappeared beneath the waters, which bubbled and roiled. We were all horrified and relieved at the same time. It showed us that the waters still worked, that the river was the best weapon we had.\nThe problem is - we don\u2019t really know why it works. People have doused the Shamblers with water before. Dr. Phlock sprinkled a bottle of Dasani on the Shambler tissue that the mercenary brought back and then on the cat. The tissue just lay there, inert. The cat was pissed off, but otherwise unaffected. We were only able to kill it by drowning it in the river, and not before it had done its damage.\nWe don\u2019t have scientists in the village to figure out the whys of this. Truth be told, Dr. Phlock was a dentist in his past life. He\u2019s sent samples of river water inland, trying to get a mass spectrometry analysis, but no one has responded. There\u2019s a rumor on the Internet that there\u2019s been an incursion to the west and north of us. We count on the moat now to protect us from Shamblers coming from other directions. Though the stream that feeds the moat comes from the river, we are uncertain of its powers. Does the water need to flow over certain ground, some numinous line in the earth, to work? The moat water diminishes and we suspect that our neighbors, our friends, are filling their old milk bottles with its contents. We suspect them of replacing the moat water with tap water. We fill our own bottles. We count the days.\nAnd the days are getting warmer. The earth is cracking from the heat. The river flows, but the water doesn't hurry. Soon the river will be a creek. Soon, a person, or a Shambler, with a large enough stride, will be able to hop across.\nI write this down. Not to alarm people, but because I think the truth is important. We had no one to tell us the truth when this all started. I did not tell the truth when this started.\nWhen my sister came down with the disease, I expected her to condemn me for my complicity in the horrible fate that awaited her. But when she lifted her eyes to mine, her look was not one of betrayal, but a vast understanding of the meaninglessness of it all.\nI ran from her then.\nShe stumbled after me and I knew she would be the end of me. I ran, crashing across the river, leaving her there on the other side. I ran, betraying the little girl who had shared her crayons with me, the teenager who had cried when I\u2019d graduated from West Point, the woman who had comforted me when I\u2019d told her of the bad things that I\u2019d done. When I\u2019d told her about all the wrong people I had worked with.\nI write now about these bad things, these wrong people. I use a pseudonym and post from an undisclosed location. My articles are still getting published, but I know this is an automated process. I begin to think that we are alone in this. That the last battle mankind will ever fight is here. I start posting under my job title: \u201cNews from the President.\u201d\nI go out to the river when the night comes again. I bring a flask to drink and I share it with Andrea and Shepherd and the others who need to come here. I light one of my last cigarettes. We all wait here and watch, as if waiting and watching will bring an answer. A Shooter walks restlessly up and down the grass line, muttering to his rifle. He\u2019s just a boy. He thinks that his bullets can really stop them. No one\u2019s told him otherwise.\nAcross this river of loneliness, I see my sister. She is standing at the shore, in a too-short, ragged dress. Her hands hang limply at her sides, palms cupped outwards. She is looking at me, drawn by some instinct that doesn\u2019t rise to thought, an instinct that brings the lost together, the living and the dead.\nI blow her a kiss as I step forward, my sneakers sucking into the mud at the river\u2018s edge. Andrea and Shepherd are silent, though after a while Shepherd starts calling for Jolie again. I take another step and feel the water come up to my shins.\n\u201cSarah,\u201d I say. \u201cWait for me.\u201d\nDianne Rees is a writer and attorney\/anarchist (no, the two are not compatible).

Mother says that I\u2019m not to go near her because she is bad. But once I read a story where a boy was told not to go near a girl because she was bad. Well, he did go near this girl and she was maybe a little bad, but she taught the boy magic and he became a wizard.\nThis is why, when Mother and I are in the park, I sit on the swings and waiting for her to turn away. When she does turn, I run for the edge of the park, where the grass turns into cement and where there are lots of grownups standing around cardboard stalls with colourful signs.\nMint is always standing here, talking to different men. Mint does not wear very much clothing, even in the autumn, and sometimes I wonder if she is cold. Now it is summer, though. She still wears less clothing than everyone else, but she does not look cold.\nShe is talking to a man and laughing. The man is laughing, too, but I cannot tell if it is a happy laugh or not. When he sees me, he stops laughing and makes motions with his eyes. Mint looks down at me and smiles.\n\u201cWhat you want, little man?\u201d\n\u201cWill you teach me magic?\u201d\nShe starts to laugh and so does the man, and this time it is easy to tell that it is happy laughter. I don\u2019t understand why it is so funny because the girl in the story did it, but only because the boy caught her using magic on a goat. So maybe this is what I have to do. I don\u2019t think there are any goats around here, though, but I\u2019m sure she will use her magic in some other way.\nSoon, Mint and the man have stopped laughing because Mother is calling me. Mint tells me to go back to her. I do what Mint says.\n***\nDuring dinner, Mother talks to me very quietly, but not softly. She is talking to me about Mint. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t go near her,\u201d she says. \u201cShe\u2019s not like us.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I know,\u201d I say proudly. And I do know, because Mint\u2019s face looks different than everyone else\u2019s face and her skin is a slightly different colour.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know,\u201d Mother says. She is not looking at me.\n***\nBy the time Mother drops me off at school the next day, I have already come up with a plan. I will escape from school and go find Mint, and then she will teach me magic. I wait in front of the doors, watching the other children arrive. Some are still eating their morning meal, the white wafer of plastic crunching between their teeth.\nMr. Lansing, the school\u2019s groundskeeper, is eyeing me. He knows that I am up to something.\nHe approaches and says, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be getting to class?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d I answer. \u201cBut if I wait for a little while longer, I can learn magic.\u201d\nMr. Lansing frowns, mutters \u201cGrade Ones\u201d, and walks away. He keeps looking at me. I do not understand why my being a grade one is special.\nWhen I\u2019m sure that Mr. Lansing is not looking at me, I turn away from the school and walk towards the park.\n***\nShe is at the edge of the park again, one foot on the grass, one foot on the cement. She does not notice me until I am standing beside her.\n\u201cHi.\u201d\nWhen she looks down this time, I can tell that she is surprised. \u201cMagic man,\u201d she says. \u201cWhere\u2019s your Mom?\u201d\n\u201cAt home. She dropped me off at school, but I came here instead.\u201d\n\u201cYeah? Why\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cI want to learn magic,\u201d I say.\nHer face is doing a lot of little moves and I can tell that this means that she is thinking her head into all sorts of different shapes. She is probably deciding if I am good enough to become her apprentice, so I stand up very straight to look taller. \u201cCome on,\u201d she says. I follow her to one of the cardboard booths, where she sits down. She hoists me onto the stool beside her. She talks to the man behind the booth, who pushes a bowl across to her. It is filled with something hot. I can tell because there is a lot of steam rising from it.\n\u201cMother says you\u2019re different,\u201d I say.\nShe looks at me through the steam and I think that maybe she has to read my fortune in the bowl and that is why there is so much steam. \u201cYour Mom\u2019s right.\u201d\nMint puts the stuff in the bowl into her mouth. I cannot do this. It would hurt me. She can do it because she\u2019s different. She knows magic.\n\u201cI know you\u2019re different,\u201d I say. \u201cYou have a different face. Your eyes look like someone stretched them out.\u201d\nMint laughs. A happy laugh. \u201cMy grandparents were from Japan.\u201d\nI think about what this means. I know all about Japan. \u201cAre you a Toshiba?\u201d\nMint laughs again.\n***\nIn the story, the girl was too old to be a girl. She was the boy\u2019s aunt. But sometimes she liked to do bad magic.\nMint is not old. Mint is young and pretty, so she probably doesn\u2019t do bad magic. That is only what old lonely aunts do.\nMr. Lansing had followed me from the school. When he saw me with Mint, he began to ask her questions that made her leave. Then he took me back to school and the principal talked to me and called Mother and she came to take me home.\nMother put me in my room. I am not allowed to come out for three days. Not for any reason. I do not like this Mother. The one I had last year was better. She did not leave me in my room. Sometimes, I wonder what kind of person the Mother I get next year will be. Maybe she will be like Mint.\nOn the third day, Mint comes to my window. I know she must be magic, because she has never been to my house before. I opened the window and she came inside.\n\u201cHey, magic man, your parents home?\u201d she whispered.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been in my room for two days and nine hours. It is my punishment for talking to you.\u201d\n\u201cRight. You still wanna learn magic?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWell, come on, then,\u201d she says, going back out the window. She helps me through and we walk along the street together.\nMint asks if I\u2019ve figured out how she\u2019s different yet. I ask if she is a Honda. She says no. I ask if she is a Sony.\n\u201cI\u2019m a human,\u201d she says. \u201cDo you know what that is?\u201d\nMother has told me about humans. Stories about humans are in my head, too. But Mother\u2019s stories are more frightening. They are not like the ones in my head that I download from school.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I answer. \u201cThey are bad things.\u201d\nShe stops walking and crouches down in front of me. She looks at me and her eyes are moving a lot. \u201cDo I look like a bad thing?\u201d\nI shake my head. She does not look like the boy\u2019s old aunt.\n\u201cWhy do you think humans are bad?\u201d\n\u201cMother tells me. And so does my head.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve never tried to find out for yourself?\u201d\nI shake my head. Mint makes a face that shows her mind. Mint cannot be bad.\n***\nWe walk past the park and past the cardboard booths to a place with old buildings and a lot of people. There are so many of them that the sidewalks are not big enough. They have to walk on the road.\nThe people in this place look different and walk different and talk different. And smell different.\nI ask Mint if this because they are magical, like her. I am worried that I won\u2019t be able to do magic because I have no smell. Mint shakes her head and moves me quickly through the crowd.\nWe walk into one of the old buildings. Mint takes me into a room and tells me to sit on the bed. The room is not very nice. Everything is old, and not in a good way.\n\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cIt\u2019s where I live.\u201d\nI am surprised. Mint is pretty and magical, so I thought that she would live in a palace. She would have a room the size of my house and wear long gowns and have servants and go to dances where she would dance with princes.\nMint asks, \u201cWhat do you know about humans?\u201d\n\u201cI know that they were living here before us, but they wrecked everything, so we had to stop them and put them in places where they\u2019d only be able to wreck a few things.\u201d\n\u201cWell, this is the place,\u201d says Mint. \u201cThis is the last ghetto. Is that all you know?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all I have been allowed to download at school. I\u2019m just a grade one, so I cannot access many of the databanks,\u201d I answer. I feel bad about being a grade one now. Maybe this is why Mr. Lansing said it that way. I want Mint to understand that I want to know more, so I keep talking. \u201cThey say that if we learn too much too fast we will break. That\u2019s why we can only learn so much at a time. And why we have Mothers. So we can learn Life Experiences. At school, we have tests.\u201d\nMint holds up a hand. \u201cI know how it works.\u201d She does not look happy. \u201cWe weren\u2019t wrecking everything,\u201d she says. \u201cWell, maybe a little, but a lot of people were trying to fix things, too. Anyway, that\u2019s not the point. The point is, this is our world, and your people stole it from us.\u201d\nI stare down at the floor. Mint has a carpet with lions on it. I want to ask her why people were wrecking things if the world was their own, but what she says about stealing it from her makes me ashamed. I do not want Mint to be angry. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nMint shrugs. \u201cThat\u2019s alright. I can still teach you magic. Still want to learn from me, even though I\u2019m human?\u201d\nI nod.\nAnd Mint tells me what I have to do.\n***\nWhen I arrive home there is still four hours left before I am allowed to leave my room. This is good because it means that Mother will not have noticed that I left.\nMint has given me instructions on what to do. I am to wait until tomorrow at noon, when she will come to get me. So, I have to plan a way to get to the park without anybody following me. This will not be easy because Mother has made Mr. Lansing promise to keep an eye on me.\nWhen I get to the park, Mint will introduce me to some other sorcerers. Then we will go to a place where I will have to pass a test to see if I am able to learn magic. I have to crawl into a space with an object that they give me. If something happens when I am alone with this object, it means that they will teach me.\nI am excited. I am sure that something will happen. I sit in my room with my hands on a soccer ball, waiting for something magical to happen. Nothing does. I try again with my computer and my clock. When nothing happens, I decide that the object they are giving me must be special.\nMint showed it to me before she brought me home. It is made of metal, but Mint says that it has a lot of different stuff inside that makes it very important. It also has a bunch of wires on it, and one long line coming off of it that the sorcerers will hold while I am inside. When I am in the right place, I will use a radio to tell them that I am ready and they will do something to the line to make the object magical.\nI bring up the picture of the object inside my head. I imagine being alone with it and telling the sorcerers I am ready and sitting there watching it. It will start to glow, and then it will start to hover in the air, and the wires will arrange themselves into a face.\nThis face will tell me something very important. It will say, \u201cYou will be the world\u2019s greatest magician.\u201d\n***\nI am at school, downloading data on the First World War. I am glad that Mint is not bad like the men with guns. I am glad I did not see anything bad like the First World War when I went to Mint\u2019s part of the city, but I know that could not have happened because humans are not allowed to have guns. Even though I am glad that nothing bad happened, I think there is something about this that makes me feel sad, and it is not just because the people in the war were wrecking things. It is something outside of that.\nWhen the recess bell rings, it is time for me to put my plan into action. I walk out in the schoolyard and look for Mr. Lansing. As Mother has instructed, he is paying special attention to me, looking for me between every spray of water he directs at the plants.\nMy plan is that I will run from the school and into the big shopping mall that is two blocks away. Then he will lose sight of me because the mall is a crowded place. I have to make sure that I have a good head start when I begin to run because Mr. Lansing\u2019s legs are longer than mine and he might be able to catch up to me.\nI look back at Mr. Lansing. He is still watering the plants. I decide that I will run as soon as he bends down to inspect a flower. He remains standing and watering, and I begin to worry that he will never bend down, and I will not get a chance. As soon as I think this, though, he does bend down and I am ready. I run fast, and I am almost a block away before I see Mr. Lansing coming out of the schoolyard to chase me.\nI make it to the mall ahead of him, but not too far ahead of him, so I keep on running. I turn into a store and hide behind a rack of coats. It does not work. Mr. Lansing parts the racks, and I walk out beside him.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go back, shall we?\u201d he says.\nI do not want to go back. I want to learn magic. I yell, \u201cGet away from me, human!\u201d\nI do not really understand why I said this, because it is not the truth, and only humans say things that are not true.\nTwo people come up and put their hands on Mr. Lansing\u2019s shoulders and his face begins to look unhappy.\nI run.\n***\nMint is waiting for me. She smiles, but her face makes it look like she is waiting for something bad to happen. Different men try to talk to her, but today she waves them off.\nWhen I first arrive at the park and see her standing on the cement between the cardboard booths, I think that she looks all alone, and this makes me feel sad for Mint. But I know I shouldn\u2019t be. People are always talking to her, and she has her sorcerer friends.\nMint takes me by the hand and tells me that we are going to meet the other sorcerers. She says that they might not be very nice to me, but they will only act that way because they have to. It is part of the test, so that they know I really want to learn magic.\nWe meet them at a place down the street from Mint\u2019s house. It is a big open room made of concrete with a lot of black stains on the floor and tools hanging on the walls. There are three sorcerers waiting for us, two men and one woman. The men have long hair and I wonder why they would try to make themselves look like girls. Maybe sorcerers are supposed to have long hair. They are all wearing long black jackets and, when Mint enters the building, she puts one on, too.\nThe sorcerers watch me closely. Their faces move down and in. This makes them look angry. One of the men takes a step back, so I stop where I am and let Mint join them. They whisper for a while before one of the men tells me to start moving. I don\u2019t know how he wants me to move, so I start jumping up and down.\nThe man\u2019s face moves in a bad way, and he hits me and knocks me over. It does not hurt, but I know it was supposed to. I stand very still.\n\u201cFucking droid,\u201d says the man. His eyes are looking at Mint when he says this. He and the two other sorcerers walk ahead and Mint beckons for me to follow.\nWe walk along the street and, eventually, the old buildings turn into new ones and the human smell disappears. I realize that we are no longer in the area where they are allowed. This is bad. Breaking the rules is forbidden. I look up at Mint, but her eyes are always pointed away from me.\nThe sorcerers pick the quietest streets to walk on and always seem to have their heads down. I think that they can see everything, though, because whenever someone else appears on the street, we move out of sight before I even realize that there was someone who could have seen us.\nI am a little bit frightened because magic is not supposed to mean being scared of other people seeing you, and because the sorcerer\u2019s black jackets remind me of something that was after the boy in the story. I know that I am safe, though. Mint will use her powers to protect me if she has to.\nWe turn down an alley and arrive at the rear wall of one of the local doctor\u2019s offices. I have been here once before, after I spent too long playing in the rain one day. I wonder why this place is magical. It seems very ordinary.\nThe man who hit me turns towards me and bends down. He face is trying to smile but his eyes still look angry, so it makes his smile look very bad. He removes something from his pocket and holds it out to me. It is the object that Mint told me about. \u201cDo you know what this is?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cIt will tell you if I can learn magic or not,\u201d I answer. His smile becomes real for a second and he does not look like such a very bad person.\n\u201cVery good,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, do you see that shaft right there?\u201d\nAt the back of the building there is a small grate. I nod again.\n\u201cGood. It goes straight up, so you\u2019ll have to use your little droid powers to climb up. Once you\u2019re at the top, you\u2019ll see another grate that will lead into a very small room. This room has all sorts of replacement droid parts. When you\u2019re there, you use this radio to tell us. And make very, very sure that the wire never breaks. Otherwise nothing will work.\u201d\nI nod. Wire is attached to a little spindle on the object and it leads into something the man holds in his hand that has a button on the top of it. He holds out the object and the radio to me and pushes me in the direction of the building. While I am walking towards it, I look back at Mint. She is looking at the ground. I cannot tell if she is happy or sad. I am sure that she is nervous for me.\nThe shaft is barely wide enough for me to fit inside. Just like the man said, it goes straight up. I measure it and it is only four meters. I have jumped higher things during recess. I jump and let myself into the room that the man talked about.\nIt is strange to see all the parts. There are rows of arms and legs on the walls and some heads on a table. I pull on the wire, to make sure that it has not broken. It becomes tight, so I know that everything is alright. I tell the sorcerers that I am in the right place.\nI hear Mint\u2019s voice on the radio. \u201cJust sit tight, magic man. Everything will be over soon.\u201d\nI sit down and wait for the magic to come.\nCavan Terrill is a science fiction writer from Ottawa.

They were roommates at a children\u2019s mental health institution on Earth, the planet with the highest sentient incarceration rate in the universe. Twenty-six girls shared the same dormitory at the facility, but Shelly was the only one that Faith trusted with her secret \u2013 she hadn\u2019t even told her therapist.\nOutside of her own family, one other person on the planet also knew the secret. It was Lacy Dawn. She was Faith\u2019s best friend back home. Before she had confided, Faith made Shelly and Lacy Dawn make cross-your-heart promises not to tell anybody else, especially not an adult.\nAll three girls were eight years old. This admission was the fourth time that Faith had gotten herself locked up for her own good, compared to two for Shelly. Lacy Dawn had never been put in a facility. She had the magic to protect herself, plus some left over to help other kids, and Lacy Dawn even made perfect grades in school.\n\u201cI\u2019m getting stronger! Soon I\u2019ll fix everything in the whole world!\u201d Lacy Dawn had screamed as the deputy shackled Faith to take her to the institution almost six weeks ago. Since then, for comfort, Faith had replayed that scene every night at 7:00 p.m. \u2013 the mandatory bedtime.\nAfter Faith had been hauled off by the deputy, Lacy Dawn chanted a magic verse \u2013 \u201che used to be a good man\u201d \u2013 and elevated above the ground to glide home. She had needed to find the only other best friend she\u2019d ever made \u2013 a naked guy that lived in a spaceship up the path behind her house in the hollow. The guy didn\u2019t have any private parts. Otherwise, she would have never trusted him.\nEven though she was locked up, or perhaps because of it, Faith believed in Lacy Dawn\u2019s magic, and knew that it would be there to help when she got out of the institution. Each day, she counted the next until release, and, at night, she schemed various plots to revenge against the people who had put her there \u2013 the school principal and psychologist, her scared mother, a big sister, a tattletale named Brittney, and most of all, her daddy.\nYounger girls at the facility would have screaming fits several times a day. They would be put in padded isolation rooms, given shots, and left until their energies had drained. That\u2019s what Shelly and Faith used to do \u2013 scream, scream, and scream some more. Older girls would spit out the medicines that stopped their hallucinations, so that they would have something interesting to talk about during the otherwise boring and ongoing group therapy sessions.\nShelly and Faith were in the middle group of girls \u2013 too old to continue the screaming fits that didn\u2019t rid the pain anyway, and too young to have achieved effective dissociation from their traumas. They were the cutters, along with six other girls in their dormitory who were about the same age. However, Shelly and Faith were the only two who had never intentionally scarred their faces. It was what had bonded their friendship \u2013 an understanding that one day they might deserve to be pretty \u2013 a shared belief that Lacy Dawn\u2019s magic was real and that, thereby, relief from victimization was at least a theoretical possibility.\nTheir hope blossomed on such a pretty day, of unknown designation or date by inmates. Shelly and Faith played within the fenced outdoor recreation yard. It was a scheduled time and the one hour period required by state statute. It was also a smoke break for the facility staff. The girls looked for sharp objects to use for self-mutilation. Pieces of plastic spoons were the best.\n\u201cDon\u2019t number that scar. It was a cat scratch.\u201d\n\u201cThanks for being honest.\u201d Shelly said and skipped one of the best scars on Faith\u2019s right forearm. She went to the next. With the ballpoint pen that she\u2019d stolen from her therapist, Shelly numbered it, and continued down Faith\u2019s arm to count the other scars.\n\u201cTwenty-seven, twenty-eight\u2026alright, you win this time. But, I bet I beat you next time,\u201d Shelly conceded.\n\u201cI cut a lot more on my left arm. I like it best,\u201d Faith said, held it up, and rotated left and right so that the scars shone in the afternoon sun.\nThe girls looked around to make sure. No security guards were watching. No adults were in view. Cigarette smoke formed a cloud that floated from around the corner of the building.\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to be old enough to get my belly button pierced,\u201d Shelly changed the game, lifted her Metallica tee shirt, and pinched her navel until it turned red.\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to get big enough to kill my daddy,\u201d Faith said, and jabbed a knifeless fist into Shelly\u2019s abdomen. They giggled and didn\u2019t stop until the school bell signaled the end of recess at the children\u2019s mental health center.\nSecurity herded the kids toward the entrance of the facility. They would remain inside the light-green walls until the next good-weather-day required outdoor recreation. In protest, one roommate, Robin, banged her head on the cinder-block wall beside the door that read FIRE EXIT.\n\u201cI bet she\u2019d stop that if you took off her helmet,\u201d Faith said to Mrs. Jackson, a 250 pound positive role model that worked the 7 to 3 shifts.\nMrs. Jackson was a Behavioral Rehabilitation Specialist. She had a high school diploma and was strong enough to physically restrain acting-out youth, regardless of how big they\u2019d grown. Most of the girls in the program liked her, and some liked her so much that they would act out on purpose to be held. For some, it felt like a bear hug by one of the few humans on Earth who was worth loving back. Older girls tended to avoid physical restraints. The subsequent injection in the butt was debilitating to participation in group therapy \u2013 an acquired addiction.\n\u201cI know that\u2019s right, honey,\u201d Mrs. Jackson agreed and knocked three times on Robin\u2019s helmet. Mrs. Jackson couldn\u2019t remember any of the girls\u2019 names, so she called them all honey. \u201cAin\u2019t you the one getting discharged tomorrow? Your Medicaid money ran out and so you\u2019ve got to go home. The government has to pay for you to be here and, well, I don\u2019t understand it all. But, that\u2019s what the Director said in the staff meeting this morning? All he ever talks about is money, money and money. I guess he knows what he\u2019s doing. I sure need more money. Are you Faith?\u201d\nTears swelled in Shelly\u2019s eyes, but she turned her head before anybody noticed. Faith punched the wall, but not so hard that it would have busted a knuckle \u2013 been there, done that.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m Faith. I didn\u2019t know nothing about being discharged this soon. I\u2019m not ready. I\u2019ll help Mr. Stan clean the dookie off the walls in the bathrooms if he\u2019ll let me stay longer. Tell the director, please\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell the boss, but you know he don\u2019t care about no shit on no walls unless there\u2019s an inspection coming up. Why do you girls smear it everyplace?\u201d\n\u201cI wish Lacy Dawn was here to help me,\u201d Faith whispered to Shelly. \u201cNo I don\u2019t,\u201d she said after reconsideration. \u201cI would never want her in a place like this.\u201d\nMrs. Jackson scooted the girls up a landing toward group therapy. Robin slid her shoulder against the wall along the way and continued to bang her head. Inside the room, Shelly grabbed Faith\u2019s hand and refused to let go. Their assigned seats were not adjacent. Given the choice between an incident and its formal report, or allowing the girls to hold hands, the therapist rearranged seats. The other girls in the session didn\u2019t object. They grabbed hands and an invincible circle around the table was established.\n\u201cWho won?\u201d the therapist asked about the self-mutilation contest. He had noticed the numbered scars on Faith\u2019s right arm.\nWithout letting go of hands, Shelly sat down last. Her tears formed a pool on the shiny table top. The girl beside Shelly, not the usual one, but the one that ended up there after the seating rearrangement, began to cry. The girl beside her did the same. And, the one beside that girl started. The sequence got to the therapist, who formed the biggest puddle of tears on the table top. Twelve girls, a gray-haired do-gooder, and Mrs. Jackson wept before the group therapy session had been called to order. Robin cried as she continued to bang her head on the table top \u2013 recurring resonating thuds.\n\u201cWhy are we crying?\u201d Mrs. Jackson asked ten minutes later to call some order to the group.\n\u201cFaith is going home tomorrow!\u201d Shelly screamed so loudly that it alerted additional staff to help out during an emergency \u2013 two janitors who had been trained in the physical restraint of kids, especially girls.\n\u201cOh, my God!\u201d the therapist reassessed the situation and the janitors left. The group cried for five more minutes.\nMrs. Jackson left the room and returned with a roll of paper towels to wipe the table. Because it was disruptive, she then gave Robin the option to stop banging her head or to be put in the isolation room. Robin stopped. All of the girls looked to the therapist for direction. He blew his nose. Robin gave him the finger.\n\u201cI\u2019ve only spit out and saved up fifteen pills since I\u2019ve been here this time. I need more,\u201d Faith said to begin the girls\u2019 obligatory disclosures.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bunch in the flower pot next to the nurses\u2019 station,\u201d Sandy, a girl who looked like a boy recommended \u2013 the doctor had triple checked her gender at admission so that she\/he would be in the correct dorm.\nThe rejected psychotropic spit into the dirt had killed the plant \u2013 a common occurrence at nurses\u2019 stations all over Earth. Most of the pills at this facility were rejected by older girls who liked their dissociative relief better than the medication. Some were from kids that enjoyed the way ADHD felt. And, other pills were from girls with Bipolar Disorder and within the manic mood swing. It was a poison mixture, but not necessarily a fatal combination for the murder of a very mean human daddy on any planet \u2013 and Faith\u2019s father was as tough as nails by any measure in the universe.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a case of sample medication for you to take home,\u201d the therapist whispered to Faith. He had tried to close the topic and begin another by passing out a written exercise \u2013 \u201cColor My Feelings.\u201d The children\u2019s worksheets turned red \u2013 all red, streaked beyond the black borders of the picture outlines, and onto the table top.\nOverwhelmed, the therapist processed his own feelings about Faith\u2019s scars, her recurring readmissions to the program, and her unwillingness to disclose anything about her family. \u201cI\u2019ll slip a bunch more medication into your suitcase after this session,\u201d he said out loud. \u201cGood luck.\u201d\nFaith nodded agreement, the girls smiled, and let go of each other\u2019s hands.\nThe next morning, the administrator insisted that Faith put on a long-sleeve shirt to cover the fresh scars on her arms. She was packed, including the take-home drugs secretly provided by her therapist into her plastic trash bag \u201csuitcase.\u201d He was the best therapist she\u2019d ever met, and the bag contained the most drugs she\u2019d ever owned.\nFaith waited in the reception area used for admissions and discharges at the children\u2019s mental health institution. It had been three hours since her Medicaid eligibility period had expired. The administrator was annoyed that he couldn\u2019t bill for the cost of the staff member who kept watch on her during the discharge process by occasionally opening his eyes from a snooze.\nTwo hours later, the security glass in front of the facility\u2019s telephone operator slid open. \u201cYour father called, Faith. He said that the truck broke down. He\u2019ll be here as soon as he finds a new fuel pump.\u201d The glass slid shut.\n\u201cCan I go talk to Shelly while I wait?\u201d Faith asked her half-awake guard.\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re discharged,\u201d he yawned, sipped a coffee that had gone cold, and shut his eyes again.\nAn hour later, a pickup truck driven by Faith\u2019s twelve year old sister parked in front of the mental health institution. Her father staggered in. Faith stood. He smacked her on the butt, and went to the counter to sign a form that the receptionist held out on a clipboard. Faith was officially discharged from the state mental health system with a guarded prognosis.\n\u201cShotgun!\u201d she yelled before they\u2019d taken the first step out of the facility. It didn\u2019t work. Faith climbed into the middle. The truck had bucket seats, but there was a storage compartment with a plywood lid between them. Her father flopped in and rubbed Faith\u2019s leg from knee to hip several times before he fell asleep. Faith\u2019s older sister smiled approval, and put her father\u2019s dirty hand between Faith\u2019s legs, where it stayed until, an hour later, the truck turned onto the hollow road.\nA hollow is a place with no relevancy to universal time measures. They exist under standards other than the commonly accepted cultural values of any planet, and with historical tradition beyond any governmental intrusion. Not very many places in the universe qualify to be hollows, but that\u2019s where Faith, Lacy Dawn, Shelly and several other families lived \u2013 a hollow. Things are different there. Things are different within every hollow on every planet within the universe, and every planet that sentient beings occupy has such private places. \u201cHollows are Necessary,\u201d according to an ancient memo issued by the management structure of the Universe, but otherwise not expounded upon since.\nThe county had asphalted to the bottom of Faith\u2019s hollow \u2013 the last school bus stop. When her daddy\u2019s truck hit the gravel and potholes beyond the paved road, the bounce was too much for sleep. Faith\u2019s father awakened. There was one chug of warm beer left in the last forty, so he downed it. He squeezed Faith\u2019s leg, and almost barfed out the window, but he didn\u2019t roll it down quick enough. The glug spurted all over the truck cab.\n\u201cDaddy, that\u2019s gross!\u201d Faith\u2019s older sister said and hit a big pothole on purpose, and wiped the inside of the windshield to clear the wet smear with her bare hand.\nThe gravel road turned to dirt, then mud. When the truck got stuck, the truck\u2019s occupants walked the quarter-mile home. It was late spring. There was bright green everyplace, except for the brown that stuck to their shoes and that made them so heavy. Faith\u2019s mother waited on the front porch. She\u2019d been there for hours.\n\u201cI know what I told you. I said that I\u2019d help you kill him this time, but\u2026,\u201d Faith\u2019s mother whispered to her, and pulled off a shoe so that mud wouldn\u2019t be tracked into the house.\n\u201cJust like last time.\u201d Faith accused. \u201cWhy do you put up with daddy?\u201d\nShe lugged her suitcases, two plastic garbage bags, to the small bedroom that she shared with her sisters and came back downstairs to redundantly confront her mother. It didn\u2019t matter this time, just like all the other times that had been planned before.\nThe next morning, Faith went to visit Lacy Dawn, who lived down the hollow a ways. They talked in the outhouse so that nobody could see them.\n\u201cBe cool,\u201d Lacy Dawn said to calm Faith. \u201cThe solution is not your own mental health \u2013 no child should be expected to just accept it. But I\u2019m impressed that your therapist gave you a bunch more pills to kill him this time \u2013 it shows that there are good people in this world.\u201d\nEverything around Lacy Dawn was greener than green. Through an increasingly bright aura, she exuded survival. Although he switched her real good at least once a day, Dwayne, her father, had never touched her in the most very wrong way. Otherwise, he would have been instantly deader than dead \u2013 not even a soul left to file an appeal. And her indigence might have exploded the planet Earth and taken a bunch of innocent people with it. She wasn\u2019t close to her peak in the maturity of power, but one wrong touch would have had explosive consequences. Lacy Dawn acknowledged her own lack of maturity to Faith.\n\u201cI\u2019m still growing up, too,\u201d she had said.\n\u201cYeah, but you\u2019ve got a good mommy,\u201d Faith retorted.\nLacy Dawn\u2019s mother would have helped nail the coffin shut given victimization of her child \u2013 not a bit like Faith\u2019s mother, who used other\u2019s pain as the best means to reduce her own.\n\u201cYour magic is getting stronger,\u201d Faith said. \u201cYou\u2019ve never ended up on the pissed on end of a mental hygiene proceeding. And you\u2019re a virgin. I can\u2019t hear it, but I can tell that nature talks back to you, maybe it\u2019s god, I don\u2019t know which one is the right answer. You go places without walking or getting mud on your shoes. You made that bruise go away on my face before the teacher called child protective services, which would have got me beat again. And you\u2019re getting pretty. I wish that I could do that.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a boyfriend,\u201d Lacy Dawn said.\n\u201cDid you let him see your panties?\u201d Faith asked.\n\u201cNo, not yet, but I\u2019m getting stronger. I\u2019ll make it happen if I decide to. I ain\u2019t got no good pair to look at right now.\u201d\n\u201cWhy does he like you then?\u201d\n\u201cHe says that he needs me to help fix things. I don\u2019t know. Boys always need something, but the main thing is that you\u2019re home and that we figure out a way to kill your daddy. My boyfriend says that he\u2019s the meanest and toughest individual he\u2019s ever heard about.\u201d\n\u201cYes, the main thing is that you grow strong enough to help me kill daddy,\u201d Faith agreed. \u201cI need a plan.\u201d\n\u201cGet two beer bottles \u2013 Budweiser, the kind that he can\u2019t afford but buys when he\u2019s drunk. Steal a little beer, here and there, and pour it into the empty bottles until they\u2019re almost full. Keep the bottles in the cellar with the lids on so that they stay cool.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I tried last time,\u201d Faith complained.\n\u201cI ain\u2019t finished,\u201d Lacy Dawn said. \u201cPut in a bunch of pills and close the lids real tight.\u201d\n\u201cIs this instant replay?\u201d Faith persisted with complaint.\n\u201cI told you that I ain\u2019t finished,\u201d Lacy Dawn continued.\n\u201cOkay, but today is Tuesday and daddy\u2019s friends come over on Saturday nights,\u201d Faith said. \u201cYou know what that means.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be ready by then,\u201d Lacy Dawn said. \u201cGo home. I\u2019ve got stuff to figure out.\u201d\nFaith obeyed \u2013 conditioned by systems that had trained her to avoid disobedience.\nLacy Dawn schemed. Nobody else in the hollow knew about the android that lived in a cave up her path. He was programmed to not harm humans, so getting him to help out in a murder conspiracy might have been tricky, but was accomplished with a flash of her butt.\nShe had spent countless hours for over three years in the space ship and plugged into educational tutorials. \u201cWhat\u2019s one more info set about chainsaw injuries?\u201d she challenged.\nLacy Dawn\u2019s training was delivered through a port that had been placed in her upper spine behind her long, stringy, brown hair \u2013 no model aspirations from the hollow, she was realistic. The android was on Earth to train and recruit her to save the universe. She didn\u2019t know what that meant yet, but she knew that he owed her something, maybe everything. She was powerful enough to sense his desperation.\n\u201cAin\u2019t nothing free in this world, Lacy Dawn,\u201d the android said.\n\u201cThis is the exact same plan you told me to try the last time that we tried to kill Faith\u2019s daddy - save up stale beer and put in a bunch pills,\u201d Lacy Dawn said to the android.\nFaith said the same thing as she slid on her butt down the muddy slope to the road and hour later. \u201cMy daddy liked the pills then, and it sure didn\u2019t kill him. He said it was really good beer.\u201d Faith stomped and splashed a mud hole for emphasis. She trudged up the dirt road to her house.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get him good this time. I\u2019ve got a Consultant,\u201d Lacy Dawn yelled. \u201cI ain\u2019t finished. Come back in an hour.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a what? Oh, I know, it's a person that helps you think - like my therapist. Tell him to help you make me pretty,\u201d Faith screamed back. \u201cI\u2018ll get more help from daddy\u2019s buddies if I\u2019m pretty! They always laugh when I ask for help, no matter what I tell them I\u2019ll do.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m working on it. I figure by the time I\u2019m eleven\u2026,\u201d Lacy Dawn, afraid to yell, said directly into the outhouse\u2019s stink hole.\n\u201cSome savior you are \u2013 too slow,\u201d Faith said to the mud, and looked back to make sure that Lacy Dawn had not heard the comment.\n\u201cIf you stab him like you want to, it\u2019s bound to be a bad scene \u2013 all that blood to clean up and stuff! Lacy Dawn yelled, knowing that her mother might hear, but not intervene. She\u2019d had first looked around to make sure that nobody else was around, but knew that all powers that truly mattered had heard her frustration.\nLacy Dawn\u2019s mother had experienced a childhood of horror. Such did not make her a champion of survivors \u2013 only an ignorer of best laid plans.\nAfter washing breakfast dishes the next day, to avoid a switching by her daddy, Lacy Dawn went up the path to visit the android again. His ship was always the cleanest place that she\u2019d ever been, but she\u2019d gotten used to it even though it was not natural.\n\u201cC\u2019mon, dude. I know that this ain\u2019t got nothing to do with saving the universe, but I\u2019ve got to do something to help Faith before tonight,\u201d Lacy Dawn argued. \u201cHer father invited those guys over again \u2013 you know - the ones who never take a bath and always want to mess with her. If you ain\u2019t gonna help me now, I ain\u2019t gonna help you later.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a bath?\u201d the android teased and plugged her into an algebra tutorial.\nLacy Dawn yanked the cable out of her spine and chanted her way home.\n\u201cYes,\u201d the android sent his reply a few minutes later, by networked email to Lacy Dawn.\nFaith and Lacy Dawn met again in the outhouse three hours before the weekend party. Since nobody had phones in the hollow, the visit was unannounced, but timed perfectly.\n\u201cHere,\u201d Lacy Dawn said, and handed Faith a diagram of a chainsaw. It had an arrow that pointed to the bar\u2019s lock-down screw. \u201cGo home. I\u2019ve got to work on it more,\u201d Lacy Dawn said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to convince my boyfriend to help me kill a human. He ain\u2019t one.\u201d\n\u201cBoyfriend? You\u2019ve got one?\u201d Faith again whined.\n\u201cNot really, just go home and come back in an hour.\u201d\nFaith left and Lacy Dawn first looked at her panties, decided no, and walked, not glided, up the path toward the spaceship. \u201cWhat\u2019s a good way to kill a man?\u201d she asked the walnut tree.\n\u201cWith a saw,\u201d the tree answered and Lacy Dawn nodded agreement. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that somewhere before.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d she said at the cave entrance and entered the android\u2019s ship. He sat in front of his monitors. Without looking up, he started a calculus lesson. She plugged herself into the cable. \u201cI want to learn everything there is about chainsaw injuries that humans experience and real quick.\u201d\nHe switched lesson plans. The consequence of noncompliance with her wishes had been the subject of a management directive. Androids are typically compliant, especially in relationship to the most powerful \u2013 like Lacy Dawn.\nHe had been sent to Earth to train her. Lacy Dawn carried a genetic implant that had been placed and tracked by the universal management structure for many generations. It enhanced her propensity for the development of savior attributes. This version of Lacy Dawn, the project\u2019s official title, was regarded by management as highly promising. The android was assigned to begin the final assessment and training of the project. Other matters, such as the survival of Faith or Earth, were regarded as inconsequential.\nThe economic foundation of the universe was in imminent danger. Lacy Dawn was the only probable contributor to the solution after thousands of years of failed strategies. Under the circumstances, and despite the prime directive implanted in all androids, management had afforded broad latitude for him to carry out the mission. The android was free to educate her on any topic. Within ten minutes, Lacy Dawn had absorbed all the information available about chainsaws, and the prospective accidents caused by their use, and that had been published by anybody and everybody on her tiny planet, and the several others whose language she had studied.\nFollowing a two minute discussion, the android handed her a small laser.\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you after I wash dinner dishes, unless it\u2019s Mommy\u2019s turn. I forget. Are you sure this tool works?\u201d Lacy Dawn asked and unplugged herself from the computer cable in her spine.\n\u201cYes. An application will disable the lock-down bolt on the chainsaw bar by reducing its diameter 95 percent. A slight pressure will cause the chain to disengage. Other than that, I cannot predict the consequences,\u201d the android said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a done deal,\u201d Lacy Dawn said five minutes later to the walnut tree on her way home down the dirt path. She exposed the miniature laser. \u201cI don\u2019t need to even find a screwdriver.\u201d\n\u201cHumans often get tense when they screw,\u201d the tree agreed. \u201cYour boyfriend is smart.\u201d\n\u201cHe ain\u2019t my boyfriend!\u201d Lacy Dawn almost cussed.\nAn hour later, the girls met for the final time in the outhouse. They then went to Faith\u2019s house where Lacy Dawn\u2019s butt was fondled by Faith\u2019s drunken father. Faith found the chainsaw leaned against the kitchen stove and took it to the back yard. After using the android\u2019s tool to mess up the chainsaw\u2019s lock-down bolt, Lacy Dawn gave Faith a hug and went home after a second grope by a couple of the guys that had arrived early with twelve packs.\n\u201cDaddy, since your friends are coming over, how about a barbecue \u2013 at least a hot dog roast?\u201d Faith asked. \u201cBut we ain\u2019t got no firewood.\u201d\n\u201cCool idea,\u201d Faith\u2019s father said.\nA few minutes later, he staggered up the hill with the chainsaw. On the way down, he squirted blood from the arm that used to be connected and dripped spray from above his eyebrows. He collapsed on the back porch. Family members and friends gathered to discuss the situation.\n\u201cMommy, you said that you would help me kill him,\u201d Faith complained as the tourniquet was tied.\n\u201cI fell in love with him when we were in junior high. He was a football star. No matter what he does to you, I have to save my reputation,\u201d Faith\u2019s mother said. \u201cBesides, if he hadn\u2019t busted your butt, somebody else would have, and it wouldn\u2019t have even been in the family like it\u2019s supposed to \u2013 grow up.\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the rest of my arm?\u201d Faith\u2019s father asked after he regained consciousness.\nThey -- all the daughters -- he didn\u2019t father no boys - picked him up and pushed him into the bed of the pickup. The oldest girl was sixteen going on twenty-five. She pop-started the truck and checked the gas gauge.\n\u201cThat brown dog carried your arm up into the woods. Do you want us to look for it or take you to a telephone to call an ambulance, butthole?\u201d Faith asked him and climbed into the bed.\nHer assertiveness was learned through mental health treatment, but was weak in application. She squeezed the arm to curb her father\u2019s blood flow. She was wearing her best jeans that became soaked. Blood dripped from the truck\u2019s bed to the ground as they climbed the dirt road out of the hollow.\nIt drew dogs away from their farm assignments. The dogs followed the truck up the hollow road, licking blood from rock tops every few yards. Twenty minutes later, to the disappointment of all family members except his wife who had no reasonable option except being alone, Faith\u2019s father was still alive. She gave up one quarter to put in the payphone and complained when it required a second. Faith gave up the quarter. A husband is only worth so much.\n\u201cAre you sure that you want us to hurry?\u201d the 911 dispatcher asked. He was one of Faith\u2019s sexual abusers before getting saved last Sunday at church.\nThe family waited and the ambulance arrived. The dogs followed them home. Two weeks later, the family visited the hospital. \u201cI can have a lot of fun with this,\u201d Faith\u2019s father said, and demonstrated his stainless-steel pinchers. Faith winced. The other family members grinned. Faith cupped her crotch.\n\u201cWe\u2019re sending him to the VA Hospital for final fitting and testing,\u201c a doctor bragged. \u201cHis prosthetic arm will be covered with flesh-like plastic. Surgeons attached his severed nerves to healthy ones in his chest. Brain impulses are picked up by a transmitter, which are sent through the arm and to the hand. When his brain tells his arm what to do, it\u2019s done in seconds, and he has pseudo feeling through the bionics,\u201d the doctor continued to report medical progress to the family members.\n\u201cBut, that\u2019s been the problem all along. Daddy has brain damage,\u201d Faith said, relieved that the cold stainless steel would be insulated instead of ongoing bare intrusion.\nRobert Eggleton is the creator of Lacy Dawn Adventures, the exploits of a victim empowered to save the universe, and a project which raises funds to prevent child abuse. His debut novel, Rarity from Hollow, was published in July, 2006 and was listed by columnist Howard-Johnson as one of the best releases of that year. He works as a therapist in a children's mental health program.\n|\n|\n______\n|\n||\n|\n______","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}

Not only was he nine and doubting everything, but he had never ever admitted his sister was right. Then there was the matter of the room they were in. It was huge and dark and at the back of an old building, with aisles and aisles of shelves that reached to the ceiling where the light bulbs gave off a dim, green light. They had been let into the room by a woman who seemed as old as the building. She had very little hair and wrinkles everywhere and had smiled at Cholly, but only lowered her eyelids and snorted when she met Isaac. In short, Isaac was scared. And the more scared he felt, the more he couldn\u2019t possibly admit Cholly was right.\nBut there it was, in a permanent book. That made him even more nervous. Almost every book he\u2019d ever seen was printed out then cycled when you were done with it. His parents only had one permanent at home. It was very old. Bible, they called it. Which was the story of God. Isaac wasn\u2019t sure who God was, but knew God was big and dangerous. As much as possible he avoided being alone in the room with Bible. So books scared him, too. And he had been telling Cholly it was all impossible since yesterday. People gone to the moon. Not really.\nYesterday Cholly had come home and that was all she would talk about.\n\u201cI saw it. I saw the pictures.\u201d She was whining because instead of wanting to go see it, he just said it never happened.\n\u201cI\u2019d have known about it,\u201d he said with a nine-year-old\u2019s unshakable certainty.\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you,\u201d she said, making it sound like a threat.\nBut she saw she wasn\u2019t getting anywhere and she ran to Da. Isaac followed behind, wanting to know. Da was in the kitchen, where Ma was cleaning up before going to work. The room and all the fixtures in it were light blue like every other room and building in the complex.\n\u201cDa, tell Isaac it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\u201cCholly,\u201d Ma had said, the one word warning her against running into the room so fast, talking so loud. She waved her hand at the video screen floating over the dinner table to lower the volume and lessen the din in the room. But it was a Council screen so you could never turn it all the way off or the volume all the way down.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s true?\u201d Da asked.\n\u201cAbout the men. On the moon.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the man on the moon? He\u2019s a big old guy.\u201d Da always talked slowly, with funny voices and a lot of smiling. All the kids loved him, Cholly most of all. But he scared Isaac sometimes. It worried him that Da never talked like other grownups. Cholly couldn\u2019t remember when Da didn\u2019t talk the way he did now but Isaac did. It was years ago, before he went away to war. Which was something he was never supposed to talk about.\n\u201cNo, no, nooo. About the people walked on the moon.\u201d\n\u201cOh, that,\u201d he said, giving Ma that wink he thought the kids never saw.\n\u201cI\u2019m serious, Da.\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019d you hear something like that?\u201d Ma asked with a hard tone and Cholly suddenly thought she\u2019d done something wrong.\n\u201cMim Jenkins showed me.\u201d\n\u201cShowed you what?\u201d She asked sharply.\n\u201cA book. A permanent one. With pictures. People walking on the moon.\u201d\n\u201cHow old was this book?\u201d Da asked, stretching the word old like it was something funny.\n\u201cReal old. And the pictures were even older. Maybe a hundred years.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a long time ago, all right. How did people look then?\u201d Da asked in a voice that swung from high to low mid-word, making Cholly smile.\n\u201cDifferent, they all have this nice shiny skin. And everything\u2019s bigger, the machines and their space suits are huge too.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder what they saw up there?\u201d Da asked, distracted by the thought.\n\u201cThey saw the earth!\u201d Cholly shouted.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think anybody really went there, do you Da?\u201d Isaac asked, afraid he was losing ground in the fight to be the one who was right.\n\u201cWell, Cholly wouldn\u2019t lie,\u201d Da said.\n\u201cNo, but the book might not be true. It might be friction.\u201d Even Ma laughed at that.\n\u201cYou\u2019re just mad because I\u2019ve seen it and you haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cAm not,\u201d Isaac said, his voice a little louder.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for you two to go to bed before you start fighting,\u201d said Ma, cutting off the dispute before it really got going. She looked at her husband, hoping she had quieted the children in time. Sometimes, if there was too much noise, he would shiver and stare at his feet, humming loudly until whatever upset him went away. But not tonight. Now, he just sat there, blowing on his soup.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why Lucy lets kids in to look at those books. She\u2019s only supposed to if she gets the permission from us or a Council,\u201d she said, glad to be peeved at something outside of her home.\n\u201cOh, what\u2019s the harm?\u201d\n\u201cThe moon. Please.\u201d\n\u201cYou think anyone ever went there,\u201d Da asked, getting more and more lost in the idea.\n\u201cMaybe, but I doubt it. Why would anyone go? There\u2019s so much to do here,\u201d Ma always talked about what there was to do. \u201cIf they did go how come nobody knows about it anymore?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe they just forgot.\u201d Da\u2019s attention shifted as a message came on the Council screen. \u201cThere\u2019s two extra services tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cCan you imagine wasting all that money?\u201d Ma asked, shaking her head. \u201cHow much would it have cost, send someone to the moon?\u201d\n\u201cMore\u2019n we got,\u201d said Isaac. As soon as the words were out he wanted them back.\n\u201cI thought I sent you to bed,\u201d Ma\u2019s voice cracked across the kitchen.\n\u201cOh, he didn\u2019t mean anything by it, did you ...\u201d\n\u201cI know what he meant. I heard him say it,\u201d these words came out in a low, almost silent hiss. Ma got angry fast these days.\n\u201cDon\u2019t get upset,\u201d Da said in voice like the kids would give to one of their stuffed toys.\nMa\u2019s eyes were bright and now she stood up extra straight. \u201cDon\u2019t ... tell ... me ... what ... to ... do,\u201d she took a deep breath between each word.\nDa got up and did a cute, bear-like waddle towards her, his arms outstretched for a hug.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be cheered up,\u201d she said slowly, through clenched teeth.\nAt that, Cholly and Isaac ran out of the kitchen and into their room, not even getting out of their clothes when they slid into bed. They fell asleep to the soft murmur from the screen on the wall.\nIsaac woke up when Cholly punched him in the shoulder and the first thing he thought of was hating the moon and all this trouble. It was early. Ma wasn\u2019t up yet and Da wasn\u2019t home. They dressed silently, slipping on AllTime jumps. Six months ago, when they were new, the jumps had changed color to reflect or absorb light and the kids could change the insulation density by rolling the dial on the cuffs. But these were just cheap Afghani jumps. Now they were always an indeterminate hue, his tending toward green and hers a dirty yellow. In winter they needed a couple of layers underneath and were useless in summer, but they were perfect for fall days like today, sunny but getting cold quickly.\nIsaac left a note saying they were going to the library before services, which wasn\u2019t exactly a lie but felt a little like because he really hoped they\u2019d miss church.\nOnce outside Cholly rushed to the clear railing, like she always did, and looked right and then left. What she saw were buildings exactly like the one their apartment was in: half of a light-blue bee-hive, 40 stories tall. Past the two buildings she could see she knew there were five more, all sitting in a circle, surrounding and protecting a yard covered by a lawn of rubber-based grass, bred to keep itself at just the right height. Looking to the left, she tried as hard as she could but she couldn\u2019t see the building where Mim Jenkins had her basement apartment. Looking straight out she saw smaller committed communities, groups of five to ten much smaller buildings, wrapped in by fences of giant metal trees that changed color according to the seasons. Their complex stood out among the other single apartment buildings that made up this part of the LAMA sprawl. Ma always told them that the people in those buildings didn\u2019t have Newjeru, didn\u2019t have people they could trust, who would look out for them. Sometimes when she said this, Isaac thought Ma hated those other people; other times he thought she was afraid of them.\nMa told them nearly every week that they had been lucky to get in here. They could barely afford the rent but had got in because of Da being a vet and because while he\u2019d been gone at war Ma had joined the Newjeru, even though Isaac didn\u2019t think she really believed. Everyone who lived here was Newjeru. That meant going to service every day, having to say \u201cJeru will be soon,\u201d if someone told you something you didn\u2019t know, wearing the symbol of a black cross and a shooting star and, for the kids, going to the Newjeru school.\nMa always smiled a lot when they went to services, Da liked the singing and people saying hi to him. Even Isaac could see it was the right place for Da. People talked slow to him and were careful to be quiet when he was around. Respectful, that\u2019s what Ma called it. And everyone looked out for Cholly and Isaac, just like they did for all the kids that lived there. And it wasn\u2019t just when they were going to church or to tell them to keep out of trouble. People would stop and talk to them if they were in the yard and looked sad or play a game with them if they were bored. Newjeru was good that way.\nStill, it was strange. Kids had to go to services before and after school. Hair wasn\u2019t allowed to grow past the top of your ears, boys or girls. The only Vee they got was the Church\u2019s two channels, Devotion and Life, so there was never anything good. And a Council screen in every room always on, telling stories from Bible or warning what not to do or calling someone to a Council meeting, but only if something bad had happened. Some of the kids even said the Council could watch you through the screen. Even the adults had to go to classes and meet with an Elder every week. There was a lot of stuff on the grid that you had to get permission to look at. And the hardest was everybody talking about everyone else. At least one sermon every week would be on what\u2019s gossiping and what\u2019s helping your neighbor along. Ma warned them about what they said because it would get back to the pastor and get them all in trouble.\nTrouble was a word Ma used a lot, as if trouble was a thing waiting to get her. It seemed to follow her everywhere. Trouble waited at the hospital where she worked and worried about keeping her job because of new techs she didn\u2019t have. Never knew when a new program would come along and replace her, she\u2019d say to explain why she was signing up for another class. So she was always studying, saving money for a training to give her one more skill. She said she needed the new skills just to keep the job she had, never mind get ahead. Trouble at home was Da. She was always happier when Da was off at work. He worked nights and they only had one day off in common. It wasn\u2019t much of a job, watching over some cleaning bots, but everybody said it was perfect for Da. Da got to be alone and in the quiet. One time Isaac heard Ma talking to Mem Webster who lived upstairs, saying that a bigger company, one with smarter bots, wouldn\u2019t even have had a job like this. Ma said she was afraid he talked to the bots.\n* * *\nSo Isaac had to come, to find out Cholly was wrong. But there was the book and there were the pictures. Old, old funny pictures of people with giant suits walking on the moon. Even when they had the helmets off of their funny suits, they\u2019d looked like nobody he had ever seen. Their faces so white and shiny, like the land they stood on.\n\u201cThat\u2019s in a desert,\u201d he said, not really believing his own words.\n\u201cUh uh. It says right here: Lunar landing. That means moon. Besides the name of the book is Voyage To The Moon.\u201d He had to admit she was right.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t they have vids? Something like that they\u2019d have vids.\u201d\nShe sighed. \u201cVid moon, Armstrong 1969.\u201d Saying each word slowly so the grid would understand.\nA screen slid down from a shelf and the children waited for it to start running. \u201cWhat\u2019s taking it so long?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s an old film.\u201d\nThe lights dimmed and the images flickered in mid-air. Sitting on a cratered landscape washed in white and black, was a strange, spider-like craft that looked like it was made from foil. A man emerged from it, came down a small ladder and then bounced across the surface in short, jerky hops. It was unlike anything Isaac had ever seen before.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a longer one, that shows \u2018em getting in the rocket and taking off and all. You wanta see it?\u201d\nThey watched for the next hour, until they were late for services, Cholly ordering up pieces that she really wanted her brother to see. Soon he knew what she meant about their skin. It was brighter than the slightly gray shade that everyone today had. He noticed their teeth, too. They were more crooked back then. He could tell because they smiled so much.\n* * *\nIsaac approached Elder Kerkallis, the lead teacher and minister for his age group, before class began.\n\u201cElder, can I ask you about something?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly, Isaac,\u201d he said in a whispery voice. Elder was a tall thin man, younger than either of Isaac\u2019s parents, he was dressed in the gray robes and the light blue skullcap all the ministers wore. Whenever Isaac spoke to him he felt like he was going to get blamed, but then again he pretty much felt that way all the time.\n\u201cWhat do you know about men going to the moon?\u201d\nThe teacher paused and Isaac shuddered, sure he had done something wrong.\n\u201cWhat a wonderful question,\u201d he finally said, \u201chave a seat and we\u2019ll all talk about it.\u201d This only made Isaac feel worse.\n\u201cGroup,\u201d Elder said loudly, getting the class\u2019s attention, \u201cMem Chen has asked a very interesting question and I want you to tell me what you know about it. Isaac, would you repeat the question?\u201d\n\u201cWell, we, my sister and I ... we\u2019re looking at this book ... a permanent one see ... and it showed people walking on the moon.\u201d At this the class, as one, snickered, but Elder shot them a look and everyone was quiet again. In the silence all he could hear was the special, nearly silent music from the Council screen that played in every class room. \u201cNo, really, they had space suits on. And there was a vid ... only they called it a movie ... about them going up in a rocket from someplace.\u201d\n\u201cFlorida,\u201d Elder said, which was so reassuring to Isaac that he practically felt his heart start to beat again. \u201cAnd Mim Ramsey, where is Florida now?\u201d\n\u201cUnderwater?\u201d\n\u201cVery good. Continue, Mem Chen.\u201d\n\u201cWell I was just wondering about it, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, then. Can anyone else tell me about these men on the moon?\u201d Elder said the last phrase very sarcastically and Isaac\u2019s spirits dropped again.\n\u201cNo using your sets,\u201d he added, locking them all out of the grid. \u201cYes, Mem Borgnan?\u201d He said to the class bully who, as always, was trying to avoid being called on.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\u201cNo? Why not?\u201d\n\u201cI mean why would they? We\u2019d just send bots and they could tell us everything.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Mim Aust?\u201d He asked to the girl who always had her hand up.\n\u201cBesides there\u2019s nothing there, right? It\u2019s just rocks and dust, right?\u201d Her response got extra attention from everyone in the room because she pretty much always went out of her way to attack anything Borgnan said.\n\u201cOh those were pretty strange times. Maybe they did it for fun. Back then people would sit on top of flag poles for days just for something to do.\u201d The tone in Elder\u2019s voice made everyone wonder whether or not he was being serious and several people made notes to check out the flagpole thing when they were allowed back on the grid.\n\u201cBut why?\u201d asked someone else.\n\u201cCould be any reason. After all, it wasn\u2019t all that long ago that doctors would cut people and spill blood out of them to treat an illness.\u201d At the description the class groaned.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t go,\u201d Mim Aust said, forcing her case.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t?\u201d and the tone in the elder\u2019s voice made Isaac feel a little sorry for her. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying that on July 20, 1969, after four days in a spacecraft probably smaller than the bathroom in any of our homes, two men didn\u2019t get out and place a flag on the surface of the moon? Is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d\nSilence.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think so. Because then you, Mim Aust, would be wrong and we all know how you feel about being wrong.\u201d A giggle skittered around the room. \u201cAs to why they went ... well Mem Chen will tell us that in his report next week, which will contain all the pictures and vids he told us about.\u201d Isaac\u2019s relief at not being laughed at ended after Kerkallis paused, gave Isaac a long look and added, \u201cAnd all the books.\u201d\n* * *\n\u201cWhat did he say? What did he say,\u201d were Cholly\u2019s first word\u2019s to Isaac when they met up after afternoon services.\n\u201cNot much.\u201d\n\u201cIsaaaaac.\u201d\n\u201cWell, first he made me repeat my question in front of the whole class. And a bunch of people laughed and said I was stupid to say that.\u201d\n\u201cDid you tell them \u2018bout the books?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Isaac made the single syllable a response to every stupid question he\u2019d ever heard. \u201cElder Kerkallis said he\u2019d read something about it once.\u201d\n\u201cDid he say why they went?\u201d\n\u201cNo. He said once upon a time people used to sit on top of flagpoles and before that they used to leak blood out of themselves whenever they got sick. And now I have to do a report on it.\u201d\n\u201cMe, too,\u201d In her enthusiasm, Cholly was oblivious to her brother\u2019s anger. \u201cElder Plotnick said she\u2019d never heard of any such thing, but I told her about the permanent book and she wanted to know all about it. She asked if we\u2019d gotten permission to see it and I told her that Mim Jenkins\u2019 said no one ever looked at them anyhow. Elder says she wants to have her up there at Council meeting.\u201d\nIsaac didn\u2019t feel any rush to go home since it was Da\u2019s night to work and he didn\u2019t want to tell Ma about the report. Even though no one had said so, he felt like he had done something wrong. So they went back to Mim Jenkins\u2019 to get the books that Elder wanted, but no one answered the door. Then they went and played in the yard until the sun went down.\nWhen they got home Isaac spoke his name to the door and it let them in. They immediately heard both their parent\u2019s voices, which meant they were both home, which meant something was wrong.\n\u201cHow could you, Justin!\u201d Ma was saying but it wasn\u2019t a question at all.\n\u201cOh, now Doreeeen,\u201d Da said in one of his comic voices, stretching out the words.\nIsaac knew whatever it was was bad because his parents were using their first names. Cholly had started to walk toward her parents in the kitchen, but Isaac grabbed her and put his hands around her mouth.\n\u201cJustin ... you\u2019ve been fired.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get fired ... I got outgraded. The company got bought a few months ago and now the new company is putting in new bots. Say they don\u2019t need me anymore, but they\u2019re giving me a good package.\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\n\u201cI just did.\u201d\n\u201cNot that. About the company.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to worry you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I worry? We\u2019re losing a third of our income.\u201d With each sentence Ma\u2019s voice got a little louder, a little faster. Each time it did, Isaac could hear Da\u2019s getting lower and slower. That meant Da was getting upset. And usually that was when Ma would hush whoever was bothering him.\n\u201cBut I told you, I\u2019m getting a package. Three months and bennies.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what do we do after that? What do we do then?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll get something. I\u2019ll get something. People like me. I\u2019m reliable. And companies get vet credit when they hire me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are they going to hire you for?\u201d Isaac had never heard his mother scream before. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been keeping up with your training! What are we going to do?\u201d\nJust then Cholly wiggled free and ran into the kitchen and started screaming, too. \u201cMa! Da! It\u2019s all true! It\u2019s all true!\u201d\n\u201cNot now Cholly! Not now!\u201d\nBut Da turned in his seat, happy for the distraction. \u201cWhat\u2019s true, Cholly?\u201d\n\u201cThe moon! The moon! The men went to the moon!\u201d She was jumping up and down, flapping her arms at her side.\n\u201cCholly, we don\u2019t care about the moon! Isaac get her out of here!\u201d\n\u201cNo, Cholly can stay,\u201d said his father, trying to ignore Ma. \u201cI want to talk to her now.\u201d\n\u201cJustin, we\u2019re not done talking yet,\u201d she said and then turned toward her son. \u201cIsaac, you take care of your sister!\u201d\nBut Isaac just tried to push himself deeper into the shadow he was standing in and Cholly kept on jumping up and down and screaming, \u201cThe moon! The moon! The men went to the moon!\u201d\n\u201cCholly, be quiet! We have to talk about this now, Justin! We have to figure out what we\u2019re going to do. We won\u2019t have enough money to stay here! Where are we going to live? Where are the kids going to go to school? I can\u2019t do it all!\u201d\nJust then, to Isaac\u2019s deepening terror, Elder Kerkalis\u2019s face showed up on the Council screen. \u201cMim and Mem Chen,\u201d he said with a slight smile, \u201cwe will need you at a Council meeting to discuss some books that Isaac got about the moon.\u201d\n\u201cThe moon! The moon! The men went to the moon!\u201d This got Cholly louder than ever. \u201cThe moon! The moon! The men went to the moon!\u201d\n\u201cShut up, Cholly, shut up!\u201d Ma screamed and threw a glass at her which broke against the wall but Cholly didn\u2019t notice, she just kept on shouting. To Isaac the whole scene moved slowly, like watching that man jump across the moon, every movement surprising for how long it took and inevitable as falling to the ground.\nDa reached across the table, his arm moving in a long, perfect arc until it crushed into Ma\u2019s face. Ma fell onto a counter and then onto the floor, plates and glasses showering around her. Without hesitation, a bot emerged from the wall to clean it up.\nNow Da was screaming so loud Isaac thought it was exploding in his head. \u201cDon\u2019t do that! Don\u2019t ever do that!\u201d And then he knocked over the kitchen table, sending plates and spoons bouncing onto the floor and he grabbed Ma and threw her against the through the air where the Council screen still flickered and against a wall.\nWith that, time went from very slow to very fast for Isaac. Tears running down his face, he ran into the room, grabbed Cholly by the arm and jerked her out of the kitchen, out of the apartment, to the hallway where people were looking out of their doors. The neighbors started to ask him something but he just pulled Cholly down flights and flights of stairs and into the big green yard.\n\u201cLook at the moon!\u201d Cholly shouted with a huge joy, as if she hadn\u2019t even seen what their parents had done. It was giant and reddish orange, so big that it seemed to have eaten the sky over their heads. For Cholly it was just a minute away from her fingertips, a place where she would bounce forever like the men in the silver suits. Isaac looked up and then ran again, pulling Cholly after him by the hand.\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna get us!\u201d he said between breaths, only seeing the huge weight bearing down on them, threatening to wipe their world away. He wanted to hide from it. He didn\u2019t want the moon, didn\u2019t want to have told anyone about it, didn\u2019t even want to know it was there. All he wanted was somewhere safe, before it all happened, before war, before Cholly found the moon, before Da hit Ma.\n\u201cNo!\u201d Cholly shouted. \u201cIt wants to be friends.\u201d\nShe wriggled her arm free of his hand so fast he fell onto his back and rolled into the short, rubbery grass. Grabbing at the dirt as if it would cover and protect him, he looked up for Cholly, wanting to bring her to ground with him, to tell her that everything had gone wrong and there was no time for the moon. But she had turned and spread her arms out wider, trying to hold the sky and everything in it. Then she turned back to her brother with the wild look in his eyes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the moon,\u201d she said, wanting to comfort him.\n|\n|\n______\n|\n||\n|\n______","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}

It was a solitary note of hope that seemed to mock our grim demeanor. Since strapping on the skis, neither of us had spoken a word and the scraping of fiberglass over hard packed snow was by default the only reply for our feathered friend.\nJames, the bail bondsman from Vegas, abruptly held up. Using only his elbows to balance on the poles, he carefully pulled off the binoculars and raised them to his eyes. It was a skill he would never have thought of mastering in the deserts of Nevada. But that was in his previous life, one in which he would routinely prey on the vulnerable for the sole purpose of making a buck.\nI waited and watched the night slowly surrender to the emerging day. Being so far north, at this time of year it was like a dark curtain being slowly drawn back, revealing a bleak land, arid and cold.\nWe had arrived at a high-point, a narrow rise about two miles south of our encampment. It held the best view and we could see clear to the horizon.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just cloud.\u201d His matter of fact tone carried an ominous edge.\nAnd confirmed my worst fear.\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\nHe half turned and showered me with a look of distain.\nI shrugged. It was a mistake to appear vulnerable in his eyes.\n\u201cYou look.\u201d He shoved the glasses at me.\nI couldn\u2019t help it, after a two years reprieve my hands still trembled.\nJames was well practiced at hiding his emotions, having ridden roughshod over frailer humans his entire life. I was not so well versed.\nBesides it was hard enough just to swallow the lump in my throat.\nIn the distance the gray clouds rolled across the sky, the screaming arctic winds propelling them eastward in an endless procession. But what caused my stomach to lurch had nothing to do with the cruel and inhospitable weather. Rather it was the faint silhouettes of figures that were framed within the predawn sky that set my guts churning.\nThey looked the same as I remembered, hazy, contorted humanoids advancing relentlessly forward.\n\u201cChrist,\u201d I whispered.\nTwo years ago they suddenly appeared off the coast of every major continent. Scientists and pundits stared into the sky and declared the legions of marching figures the beginning of a new age for mankind. They were thought to be enlightened aliens making first contact or, at the very least, telepathic greetings sent from across the cosmos. Religious leaders proclaimed the second coming and people everywhere stayed glued to their TV\u2019s or made a beeline for the coast to watch the \u2018revelation\u2019 firsthand.\n\u201cThey followed us,\u201d James continued, though I wasn\u2019t sure if he was just talking to himself. I didn\u2019t bother to answer.\nThe BBC described them as \u2018rows of amateur marionettes stumbling forward in hurried, jerky movements, the actions so unnatural as to presuppose an inexact copy of mankind itself.\u2019\nThe coverage was 24\/7 and we watched for three days as the minions advanced robotic-like towards the coast, their outlines growing larger but remaining indistinct and fuzzy in the pale blue Californian sky. The faces, surrounded by a soft, reddish hue, remained blank and expressionless. Finally, after hours of intense anticipation, their long shadows touched land.\nAnd people began to die.\nBy the thousands. Anyone within miles of the dark stain succumbed in seconds. Like clouds sweeping before a storm, the shadows infected every living thing with its touch, consuming them in death. Neither gender nor age had any bearing.\nMost passed uneventfully, dropping silently to the ground as from a painless heart attack or stroke. Others vanished into nothingness in the blink of an eye. But what could not be ignored was what happened to select individuals. These unfortunate ones were engulfed in flame or saw their skin slowly peel off their torsos in an exquisitely agonizing death sequence. Their screams lasted only for a paltry few seconds but it was enough to panic an entire planet.\nThe last station went off the air two days later but it wasn\u2019t before everyone got a good look at the charred cinders of human remains, or flayed corpses twitching in the middle of a downtown street.\nOur civilization, in the making for thousands of years, was undone over the course of one sunny holiday weekend. With a single television image, the world descended into unsalvageable chaos.\nThe survivors, millions of terrified people, surged away from the coasts, trampling thousands and leaving once proud cities burning in their wake.\nThe legions of marching marionettes, seemingly oblivious to the carnage below, surged relentlessly forward, sowing death and destruction with every step.\nAs my eyes adjusted to the gloom, I could discern the familiar jerky movements within the cloudbank.\nI slowly lowered the glasses.\n\u201cWe\u2019d better get back,\u201d James mumbled, his usually hard tone leaking frustration. \u201cThe others will be wondering.\u201d\nHe waited until I swiveled my skis around before following me down the hill. My mind was blank as I retraced the path to the cabin.\n***\n\u201cChrist, I haven\u2019t seen this much food since we broke into the school cafeteria after Christmas exams!\u201d I exclaimed. The old wooden table was literally overflowing with steaming pots and plates.\nMaggie wiped her hands on her apron but frowned in my direction.\n\u201cI\u2019ll thank you for noticing the work, young Calvin, but there\u2019s no need for swearing with young ears around. You will mind your words in my kitchen.\u201d\nOffering up a chagrinned smile, I slid into my seat next to the pile of split wood. Maggie\u2019s daughter Rachel made a show of rolling her eyes.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard swear words before, mother.\u201d\n\u201cNot in my house. Besides that doesn\u2019t make it right.\u201d She stepped over to take another bubbling pot off the old iron stove.\nI winked at Rachel. \u201cThat\u2019s what mothers are for,\u201d I whispered.\nShe smiled back. The thirteen year old had a crush on me ever since the bondsman and I pulled her and her mom out of that burning car on the outskirts of Juneau.\nThat was nine months ago.\nMaggie was initially apprehensive until she saw where my values lay. I may have only been six years older but Rachel and I were still separated by the better part of a lifetime.\nThe corollary was that Maggie treated me like a long lost nephew and even though she was only in her forties it was hard to think of her in anything but a matronly fashion.\nHow ironic. It\u2019s the end of the world and I\u2019m bunking with two unattached females, one much too young and one trying to be my mother.\n\u201cDamn\u2026\u201d\nThe chair jostled on my right and interrupted my musings. Wilbur and his ever present gameboy took his seat at the table. If he noticed the feast over the beeps and whistles of the game he gave no indication.\nWe picked him up several weeks after finding the girls. He was starving, the last surviving member of a group that had made a stand just north of Fairbanks. Their canned food had gone bad and by the time they discovered the problem they were too weak to search for more supplies.\nWilbur told us his name and his age but not much else. Even now, six months later, he speaks only occasionally and even then rarely wastes a word. He did manage to hook his gameboy up to a warped solar panel so he can play ten to twelve hours most days. Needless to say he doesn\u2019t interact with the rest of us much, choosing instead to cloister himself with the handheld in whatever corner happens to be free at the moment.\n\u201cEveryone sleep well?\u201d Maggie tossed the question over one shoulder as she shifted pots on the wood stove\u2019s only burner. Everyone understood the unspoken question; did anyone actually get to sleep last night? Or were we more like convicts the night prior to their scheduled executions, mentally pacing the confines of the single-roomed cabin.\nA chorus of \u2018ayes\u2019 answered her.\nShe smiled and shoved another log into the side of the stove.\n\u201cCan\u2019t be much left in the storeroom,\u201d I remarked. \u201cConsidering what we\u2019ve been eating these last couple of days.\u201d\nThe smile remained as she hurriedly carried a steaming bowl to the table. I swear that women could maintain a smile through a bloody blizzard.\n\u201cGetting pretty empty,\u201d she admitted and then winked at her daughter. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry; I\u2019ve hidden the last chocolate bar for just us.\u201d\nRachel giggled.\nI realized there was another positive aspect. None of us would be making a run into the village for food.\nShe brushed a lock of hair off Rachel\u2019s face and exchanged a meaningful look with me. I dutifully never said a word.\nCome noon it will be two days since James and I returned to the cabin with the news. Oddly enough they took the report calmly and no one had made a comment about it since. Maybe after two years we just were too tired of running.\nTo her credit Maggie had fed us like kings. Wilbur remained intertwined with his gameboy and I watched the marionettes grow larger in the sky with each passing hour.\nLike a well-heeled army, they were advancing on our humble abode in a grim and determined fashion.\nThe screen door screeched open and the large, familiar frame of the bondsman filled the archway. He carried a melancholy mood at the best of times but the unsavory look he brandished about the room was harsh even for him.\n\u201cShadows are covering the village now,\u201d he announced brusquely. \u201cThere\u2019s no way back to the main road.\u201d\nHis face hidden by the handheld, Wilbur snorted. \u201cAs if there was somewhere else to go. We\u2019re at the edge of the world for God\u2019s sake.\u201d\nI watched the tips of James ears turn red. It was time to interject.\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a point. Short of swimming across the Arctic Ocean this is as far away from civilization as we can get.\u201d\nThe big man turned his glare on me. The amount of vehemence in that look required a lifetime of accumulation.\n\u201cSo what then, college boy? You going to just sit back and accept it? Or spend the last few hours talking about the \u2018good times\u2019 and our last \u2018road trip\u2019?\u201d\nHe was intimidating but I learned long ago not to back down. His kind dominates the meek and mild. He had done so for years.\n\u201cYou asked me the same questions in Colorado after the nuclear plant went critical and the fallout almost got us. And in those hick towns in Montana and Alberta\u2026 you remember the \u2018discussion\u2019 we had at the church when we arrived the morning after the fire \u2026\u201d I shivered at the memory. James only tensed even more, like a lion about to spring.\n\u201cNot to mention Juneau, Whitehorse and, Christ, how many other ghost towns? Each time we picked up and, unlike the corpses festering in the streets, moved on. All the way from California\u2026 somehow we managed to avoid those scions of death.\u201d I took a deep breath. The parade of memories was creating a tremor in my voice and the girls were staring at me wide eyed.\n\u201cBut dammit, James, there is no where else to run! The sea is at our back and you just said the road was blocked. Even you can\u2019t outrun those demons across the tundra. Unless you\u2019re Moses in disguise and plan to separate the seas\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBah!\u201d He threw off his parka and stomped across the kitchen. \u201cI should never have saved your butt in the first place.\u201d His voice trailed off into a whisper. \u201cSilver spooned college boy\u2026\u201d He used a napkin to wipe the sheen of sweat off his receding forehead.\n\u201cDamn weather is unnatural,\u201d he declared.\nI hid a smile, recognizing his familiar ploy of changing topics when he felt cornered. \u201cLook at me; I\u2019m sweating in the bloody arctic! It\u2019s sunny for the four thousandth day in a row!\u201d\nWilbur snorted again, this time in obvious agreement. Then again, they both had a point.\nFrom day one it had been nothing but sun and cloud. Nothing else. No rain, snow, fog\u2026 nothing. If someone had a giant weather machine, he must have pressed the pause button before stepping out... Two years ago.\nThe bluster suddenly went out of the big fella and he slumped into the chair at the head of the table. His eyes seemed distant for a few moments before he noticed the feast. His gaze flicked to Maggie before coming back to rest on me.\nI shrugged.\nMaggie found a space in the center to lay down the final plate. She wiped her hands on her apron and invited everyone to dig in.\nWithout looking up, Wilbur paused his game and grabbed his utensils.\nIt was Rachel who asked the obvious question. \u201cSo are they are getting closer, Mr. Kennedy? The shadows I mean, they\u2019re coming this way?\u201d\nJames was ready to spit back a caustic remark when Maggie\u2019s glare buried it in his throat.\n\u201cEr, yeah\u2026 well a little. There\u2019s some question about direction and timing\u2026\u201d\nMaggie interrupted by bending forward to pour some split pea soup into her daughter\u2019s bowl.\n\u201cNow, Rachel, Mr. Kennedy just got in and needs a few minutes to catch his breath. Let\u2019s remember our manners and give the man some space. There will be plenty of time to talk about shadows later.\u201d\nThis time her smile looked forced.\n\u201cYes, Mother.\u201d Rachel murmured.\nWe ate in silence for fifteen minutes until Wilbur\u2019s gameboy started beeping.\n\u201cBattery\u2019s low,\u201d he mumbled, pulling away from the table and hustling out of the room.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s he going?\u201d Rachel asked.\nJames chuckled. \u201cHave you been paying attention lately missy? At the moment he\u2019s climbing up the roof to reconnect his do-dad to the solar panel he\u2019s got taped to the smoke stack.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019d he know how to do that anyway?\u201d I asked. \u201cHe\u2019s got about ten different wires connected to that\u2026 do-dad.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy for him.\u201d Maggie paused. \u201cHe was in University like you, Calvin. Third year electrical at MIT. Must have been doing well too because he mentioned something about a pending internship at NASA. Of course that\u2019s before Armageddon showed up at our doorstep.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019d you know that?\u201d\n\u201cI asked him. How else?\u201d\nI was surprised. \u201cWell I\u2019m glad he speaks to someone around here.\u201d\n\u201cWhy does he keep playing that game all day?\u201d Rachel asked. \u201cHe won\u2019t even let me have a turn.\u201d\nJames snickered. \u201cBecause he\u2019s acting like an ostrich burying his head in the sand. He\u2019s hiding from what\u2019s about to\u2026\u201d\n\u201cCarrots, James?\u201d Maggie thrust the bowl under the man\u2019s nose. \u201cYou look like you could use some fiber.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Uh, thanks. I was just speculating\u2026\u201d\nBy the look on Rachel\u2019s face, she had no idea what he was getting at.\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s still in shock,\u201d I offered. \u201cWe did pull him out of a tight predicament.\u201d\n\u201cYou show me anyone here who hasn\u2019t survived a bad situation,\u201d James sneered. \u201cWe\u2019ve all lost family and friends, and that\u2019s not the worst of it\u2026\u201d\nHis voice trailed off but I could tell he wanted to say more.\nAn awkward silence followed as the four of us made an effort to keep eating. But without a real appetite it was hard to do.\n***\nMaggie and I leaned over the deck rail and stared silently into the distance. Legions of fluffy clouds swept across another pale blue sky, beautiful sirens signaling the approaching death. Beyond them, high in the atmosphere, the indistinct forms of shuffling mannequins marched inexorable forward.\nThe two-by-four under my arms felt cool and rough, the results of weather on decades old construction. It was a relief to drop my gaze and just stare at the gray wood.\nI noticed Maggie rocking slowly on the balls of her feet, using her elbows as a pivot against the wood.\n\u201cMr. Kennedy says the shadows will reach the cabin sometime tomorrow.\u201d\nI caught her eye and nodded. \u201cHe told me.\u201d She was starting to tremble. I wanted to comfort her, like a real friend would do, but it was too awkward and I was too young.\n\u201cHow\u2019s Rachel?\u201d\nShe tried a smile. \u201cI found an old cryptogram book in the closest. She\u2019s busy working on the puzzles.\u201d\nAs a thirteen year old was wont to do.\n\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure about the next question but I sensed she wanted to talk.\n\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d\nA sudden sob escaped her throat and she hurriedly put a hand to her mouth. I took a step but she waved me back. She took a moment to regain her composure.\n\u201cI\u2019m ok.\u201d She took a breath. \u201cI knew this was coming. I tried to prepare but\u2026\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you can practice.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t I know it?\u201d\nShe smiled and this time it came naturally. \u201cCalvin, you\u2019ve been a real gentleman these last four months. I wanted to tell you that. In fact, if the truth be known, you\u2019ve been the only sane person around this joint. Wilbur has been a deaf mute twenty-three hours a day and Mr. Kennedy has been, well, himself. I\u2019m glad Rachel has taken a liking to you.\u201d She paused and the smile faded. \u201cThat by itself has saved her, and me, some of the worry\u2026 some of the pain.\u201d She slowly turned back to stare at the apparitions in the sky.\n\u201cTomorrow I\u2019m going to take my little girl to that hill just west of here, the one with the pretty blue flowers poking through the snow. Unbeknownst to her I\u2019m going to sit her down with her back to what\u2019s coming. Then I\u2019m going to tell her about the day she was born and how excited her daddy and brothers were. I\u2019m going to describe how she lost her first tooth and what she wore on the first day of kindergarten.\u201d\nThe tears silently began to fall and she made no attempt to brush them off.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a mother daughter day\u2026 for as long as it lasts\u2026\u201d\nI felt the hidden fear and had to ask. \u201cMaggie, aren\u2019t you worried about, some of the people died\u2026\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cI believe they were the bad ones, Calvin, those who lived outside His Blessing. The vast majority passed on quietly. We will have nothing to fear.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\nShe took my hand in hers. \u201cAfter forty-five years you learn a few things. I\u2019ve led a boring life, one you would call \u2018safe\u2019. And Rachel, well, she\u2019s just a kid. We\u2019ll be ready.\u201d\nWe stood there for a long time, hand in hand, just staring into the abyss.\n***\nWhen I walked back outside the only thing that had changed at all was Wilbur. Our favorite computer nerd had moved from one side of the porch to the other, the game clicking and beeping happily in his grasp.\nI could only shake my head.\nThe sun was drifting down as afternoon gave way to evening, the wind picking up between the trees. The snow crunched under my boots as I wondered aimlessly away from the cabin. For some reason I was full of useless energy. If I was ten years older they\u2019d call it anxiety or restless legs. I was too young for that.\nBut not too young to die.\nA sudden cry echoed in the wood and I hastened towards the sound. Seconds later I entered a small glade and was shocked to see James carrying Rachel in his arms.\nHe looked just as shocked to see me.\n\u201cWhat the\u2026?\u201d Through a sudden red haze I started towards him.\nThe bail bondsman slowly put the girl down. She looked flushed and shaken.\nHe held up one hand. \u201cWait, Calvin.\u201d\nHe was half a foot taller and a good fifty pounds heavier but I didn\u2019t care. I bent down and picked up a thick branch.\nThen, to my surprise, Rachel jumped up and kissed him on the cheek.\n\u201cThank you, Mr. Kennedy.\u201d Then she waved at me and ran back in the direction of the cabin.\nNow I was really confused. I stopped in my tracks and dropped the stick.\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d\nHe had a funny expression on his face as he stepped over.\n\u201cI was out walking when I heard the little one call out for help,\u201d he explained. \u201cI found her stuck up that tree. Apparently she was out trying to catch a squirrel when she got stuck. It took me ten minutes to convince her to jump. That\u2019s when you decided to show up.\u201d He looked at me square. \u201cCalvin, I know what you people think of me. God, it\u2019s no different than anyone I\u2019ve ever known. But I would never\u2026\u201d\nIt was ironic. After traveling with this guy for two years, through cities and towns worse than Dante\u2019s Inferno, I realized at that moment I was seeing him in a new light. I finally realized why the big man from Nevada was running so hard. He was terrified. Terrified of suffering the fate of so many other \u2018undesirables\u2019.\nHowever I could see straight into his soul. Though scarred and frayed, it remained whole and unblemished. There was honor there.\nI grasped his hand and shook it. \u201cYou\u2019re going to do fine tomorrow, James.\u201d\nHe looked at me with a tentative, hopeful expression. He knew what I was saying and \u2018wanted\u2019 to believe.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I repeated. \u201cIt will be all right.\u201d\nOur hands dropped and I turned back to the cabin. I knew he was staring at my back, a faint flicker of hope in his heart.\n***\nSunlight was filling the room when I finally woke up.\n\u2018Damn!\u2019 I felt a spasm of panic. \u2018Did I oversleep?\u2019\nI hustled into my clothes and, still buttoning my shirt, barged into the kitchen.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\nThere wasn\u2019t a sound.\n\u201cAnybody here?\u201d\nNo answer.\nOn the kitchen table, cleared and clean, sat a small glass of flowers.\nI smiled. Maggie and Rachel were on their way to scale a certain hill and had left us a parting gift.\n\u201cBye, guys,\u201d I whispered. \u201cSee you soon.\u201d\nI withdrew the last container of OJ from the icebox and drained it. For some reason I was extremely thirsty.\n\u201cJames, Wilbur.\u201d\nBut only the soft rustle of branches outside the window answered me.\nI tucked in my shirt and stepped outside.\nTo my surprise Wilbur was sitting in the old rocking chair, feet perched on the railing. The gameboy was nowhere in sight.\n\u201cWilbur?\u201d\n\u201cMr. Kennedy left for town about two hours ago.\u201d The bespeckled young man didn\u2019t bother looking at me. \u201cHe said he had to pick up some supplies.\u201d\n\u201cIn town?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Finally he looked in my direction. His eyes were dilated and wide. He was scared. \u201cHe left a message for you.\u201d\n\u201cUh ha.\u201d\n\u201cHe said he\u2019d be waiting for you on the other side and if you were wrong he was going to kick your butt.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t help it, I laughed.\n\u201cI bet he would.\u201d I muttered.\nWilbur was still staring at me.\n\u201cI see you\u2019re not playing anymore.\u201d\nHe shook his head. \u201cI finished twenty minutes ago.\u201d\n\u201cFinished, or decided enough was enough?\u201d\n\u201cAll twenty-seven levels, all on the impossible setting.\u201d When I didn\u2019t look impressed, he continued. \u201cNobody knew it here but back at school me and a few friends actually designed this game. It was the cutting edge, incredible graphics, humorous, challenging, customizable\u2026 Sony had already bought the distribution rights. It was going to be the greatest thing since Super Mario and I was on track to be the next Bill Gates.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t follow. \u201cSo you wanted to play it till the end?\u201d\n\u201cWe engineered the settings so anyone could play, from three to ninety-three, from kindergarten to genius. \u2018Impossible\u2019 was the ultimate. We put it there as a joke knowing it couldn\u2019t be beat. No human could defeat our mathematical computer. The science was absolute.\u201d His gaze turned inward. \u201cAfter watching my family die, I knew I needed more to keep on living. The only way I could do that was by playing this damned game\u2026 and beating it. I wanted\u2026 I needed to prove that there is more than fact and science. Sometimes there\u2019s faith and nothing else.\u201d\nIn my mind, the fog lifted and I understood. \u201cI\u2026 see. And now?\u201d\nHe leaned back in the chair and the old wood creaked under the weight change. \u201cNow I\u2019d like to sit here for a while and think.\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d I descended the steps and glanced up into the sky.\nThe figures were as big as mountains, moving limbs fantastically huge.\n\u2018Christ!\u2019 My knees began to shake.\n\u201cWilbur, I\u2019m\u2026 going for a walk.\u201d\n\u201cGood bye, Calvin.\u201d\nI let my legs take me away from the cabin. I already knew where I would end up.\n\u201cCalvin!\u201d Wilbur was leaning over the railing.\nI looked back.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he shouted. \u201cFor taking me in.\u201d\nI waved and he disappeared into the shadow of the deck.\nMy legs took me north. I wasn\u2019t quite in a hurry and yet I dared not stop. Something was tugging at my heels and fear swept me forward across the snow. The trail to the sea was rough but fairly straight and yet it still took the better part of an hour to reach the water. I felt the winds pick up near the coast and realized I should have brought a jacket.\nTurning about to gaze at the advancing marionettes was in itself a test of courage. I had not created any separation. They still towered over me, omniscient and threatening.\nFor the first time, I noticed something else as well. Instead of numbering in the thousands, as they did on that very first day, there were but four figures left in the pale blue sky.\n\u2018The four horsemen of the Apocalypse.\u2019 My brain drudged up the analogy.\nI traced a path along the rocky shoreline before coming to an extended point that stabbed deep into the water. Our small canoe lay on its side in the wild grass as white caps and small icebergs dotted the green expanse as far as the horizon. Strange how the sky remained clear, the air relatively warm, and yet the snow refused to melt.\nThen I noticed the sudden change. Now there were only two figures twisting in the sky.\n\u201cMaggie\u2026 Rachel\u2026\u201d I fought back a growing lump in my throat. \u201cBe safe\u2026\u201d\nAt the tip of the point, the wind whipped around me, rustling my hair and pelting me with frigid spray. Out of the corner of my eye, I spied a rather large iceberg drifting close.\nOn impulse, I pulled the canoe into the water and paddled right up to the iceberg. Balancing precariously on the sides of the canoe, I leapt across the intervening space and landed on my butt on the ice. It shuddered slightly under the impact.\nI sat down in the center and watched the land slowly drift away. Huge waves rolled around me, whitecaps slamming into the sides of my ship.\nThe breath caught in my throat as I realized there was but one remaining apparition above me. One last human being on the planet. Our age was coming to an end.\nI drifted for hours, the waves buffeting me relentlessly, almost capsizing me on several occasions. Soaked yet undaunted I held on, watching the shadow in the sky come ever closer. It followed the wind and chased the tide. I couldn\u2019t outrun it\u2026 even if I wanted to.\nStill, like hounds on the hunt, it was relentless. I figured it had a job to do.\nThen, as the sun began its final descent in the west, and the golden hue of vermillion clouds painted the sky, the winds mysteriously faded and finally died.\nThe waters of the Arctic Ocean settled into an unnatural calm. The air was stilled by some unseen hand.\nThe apparition appeared to bend towards the water, its descent making it appear even larger. Soon it blocked out the entire sky. A dark stain, like a consuming plague, drew swiftly across the stillness. With heart pounding anticipation, I watched it close on my icy platform.\nJust before I became one with the darkness, I swear I saw the eyes of the marionette twinkle and raise his right arm to gesture skywards. Somewhere in the distance, trumpets sounded as a warm breath of wind tickled my face and carried with it a soft voice that whispered softly\u2026\n\u201cThe time of waiting is over.

Sick and twisted.\u201d\n\u201cI just pity anyone who finds themselves in such a position where they have to resort to something like that.\u201d Phil threw the adult catalogue down on the desk, where the force of the impact warped its plastic screen just long enough to wobble the picture slightly. \u201cBase, crude, carnal pleasure.\u201d\n\u201cDepraved,\u201d his colleague Steve agreed, absently.\n\u201cWas that depraved? Or deprived?\u201d\n\u201cBoth.\u201d\n\u201cHmm. Can\u2019t they find the attention they crave any other way?\u201d Phil looked down at the touch sensitive screen and scoffed contemptuously. \u201cI mean, who pays who to come up with stuff like this? \u2018The First Law of Robo-Erotics: A Fundroid shall do anything possible to please its master.\u2019 Asimov\u2019s probably turning in his grave, poor man.\u201d\nSteve, staring at his workstation, furrowed his brow and nodded as the taller man stood and fumed happily to everyone in the vicinity. The Red-Light Robotics electronic catalogue looked innocently up from the desktop, as if surprised that anyone could be making such a fuss over little old it.\n\u201cThe whole point of the sexual side of a relationship is to cement and strengthen the bonds that already exist between two or more people\u2014\u201d\n\u201cApart from kids.\u201d\n\u201cOf course apart from kids. Kids go without saying really,\u201d he shrugged. \u201cBut what happened to traditional civil partnership values? When people really love each other and want to express that otherwise indescribable depth of feeling? Or am I being too twenty first century about this?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026For the times they are a\u2019changing\u2026\u201d sang Steve softly.\n\u201cWell, yes, of course, goes without saying, really,\u201d Phil conceded. Then: \u201cMaybe some men prefer to live alone. Fewer arguments, no commitment. But look, Steve, you and I, we\u2019re both family men, right? Both happily married? Aspirations for a bit of reproduction in the not too distant future, eh?\u201d\n\u201cMmm.\u201d Steve was noncommittal.\n\u201cOf course we\u2019ve never met your Sandra; we must get together outside work sometime, you and Sandra and Mary and I. Catch a holopic, maybe; those things are getting so ridiculously realistic these days.\u201d He smiled, the catalogue temporarily forgotten.\n\u201cErr, yeah, sure, some day.\u201d Steve\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t move from his network interface. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got, err, a very busy schedule these next few weeks, very little free time, and I expect I\u2019ll have to spend most of that sleeping, you know, and, well, you know how it is.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, sure, I understand. Whenever you\u2019re free. Whatever.\u201d\n\u201cMm. Anyway, must get on.\u201d Steve flicked a glance up at his friend, followed it up with a timid half smile, a nervous twitch of one lip. \u201cBut I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d\n\u201cDefinitely.\u201d Phil flashed a confident smile and returned to his desk. Steve glanced disdainfully at the catalogue\u2014its \u2018anatomically precise\u2019 mechanical partners failing to entice\u2014and, with a swift flick, tossed it into the recycler.\n\u201cSteve! You\u2019re home early.\u201d She grinned, the sunbeam waterfalls of her hair flowing sumptuously over golden brown shoulders, delicately curved, her petite collarbones enchantingly well defined.\n\u201cSandra.\u201d He beamed as he entered the apartment. \u201cThe earlier train was a little late, so I didn\u2019t have to wait.\u201d\nHer emerald eyes radiated a sparkling glee like the morning grass, rich with early dew as he dropped his coat down the refresher chute. It whizzed away to some unknown cleaning destination several floors below. \u201cPhil found a Fundroid catalogue at work today,\u201d he remarked, blithely.\n\u201cReally?\u201d She folded her arms, a mock inquisitor. \u201cYou weren\u2019t tempted to replace me with an android, were you?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d he reassured her. \u201cThey can\u2019t quite simulate walking properly, yet, you know. Just sort of lurch. And think of all the awkward maintenance costs they would entail.\u201d He enjoyed a luxurious stretch.\nShe nodded enthusiastically. \u201cAt least you don\u2019t have to oil me.\u201d Her full red lips parted, an elegant white smile sliding into view as she moved forward; head to one side, she approached and drew near. Her eyes grew shadowy as her lids lowered.\n\u201cOh, Steve, I\u2019ve missed you\u2026\u201d\nHe looked down. \u201cI can tell\u2026\u201d\nSoftly she placed a bronzed finger to his lips and leant in close to his ear. \u201cHave you had a hard day at work?\u201d she cooed. He felt each individual hair rise as one as her warm breath caressed his neck. He inhaled sharply.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he rasped, his broken whisper not entirely truthful.\n\u201cLet me make it better\u2026?\u201d she pleaded, stroking a stray strand of dark, wavy hair he had tucked behind one ear.\nHe feigned reluctance. \u201cWell\u2026\u201d he teased her. She pulled back to look him straight in the eye, one eyebrow raised, mouth curling impishly.\nHe slid his arms around her slim frame; their mouths found each other with a forceful passion.\n\u201cOh, Steve\u2026\u201d she breathed.\n\u201cSandra\u2026\u201d\nAnd the room went black. Hands moved through thin air as the apartment descended into darkness and force fields failed. Steve nearly fell over; Sandra had disappeared with the light. He sighed. Damn power cut.\nMichael Kay is a British university student who spends most of his time wishing he spent more of his time writing.

The plain fact is that I live by the point of a sword, thieving what other men earn and killing those who try to stop me.\nToday was no exception.\nWhen the priest raised his hand to me, I sliced off his head.\nKate had dispatched me to the temple to capture him. It's always good to keep a priest alive, if you happen to find one.\nA lot of sea brigands respect priests, won't touch them, as if they think that will stop the Gods those priests serve from damning them to hell.\nNot Captain Kate.\nShe's never told me why, and I've never asked, but she hates priests the way a farmer hates Mandars, the way a shopkeeper hates sneak thieves, and she thinks nothing of using them for her own purposes. If this one had been a good boy and left the fighting to the pair of soldiers that were supposed to be guarding him, he'd be the bargaining chip if anything went wrong.\nUnfortunately for him, he wasn't such a good boy, and my instincts kicked in before the soldiers could intervene. He didn't even have time to utter a curse against me, to swear or scream or beg for mercy.\nOne second, he balled his hand into a fist. The next, I swung out my sword to separate his neck from his shoulders. His eyes widened in shock. He gurgled something that might have been an attempt at speech or might have been a stillborn scream. His head rolled onto the ground just as the soldiers came up behind him.\nThe Central Confederacy never bothers to station too many men in piece of shit port towns like this one, and they never waste the experienced soldiers. From the looks of these two, they fit that pattern.\nOutraged by my blasphemy, the younger of the two ran toward me, swinging his sword in huge strokes. He screamed something. I don't know what. When I'm in the heat of things, all sounds blur into one sound, one thing, like a dull roar echoing through the silence.\nCrumbs from whatever he'd been eating before he was called out to do his duty landed in the soldier's blond beard as he screamed. The hand that swung his sword was shaking in fury. All of my concentration was focused on that arm.\nI edged out of the way, keeping my blade low, but angled up to deflect any sudden blows. Come on.... Right on time, he obliged me.\nHe swung his sword upward in a huge arc...\n....and I plunged my own into his exposed neck. Blood spurted like a fountain, splattering everywhere.\nHis corpse collapsed onto the ground.\nHis comrade kept on coming toward me, his sword held at the ready, his eyes wary.\nShifting my shoulder pack to the other side, I raised my sword level with my eyes, on guard but making no move toward him. \u201cLook, I'll be on my way soon enough.\u201d\nThe soldier laughed. \u201cWhy should I let you go, pirate?\u201d\nIt would have been more convincing if his voice wasn't shaking, but under the circumstances, it seemed unwise to point that out.\n\u201cBecause,\u201d I said instead, very slowly and very reasonably, \u201cthat way you won't die.\u201d\nHis response came in the form of a swift thrust of his sword. I parried, just in time, and danced out of his way.\nOur blades clanged together, again and again, as we struggled for advantage. He swung out a final time. I parried.\nFor a second, our swords were pressed together, neither of us able to thrust forward, neither of us able to tear away. I could smell the sweat soaking his white soldier's blouse. I pressed forward. He held his ground. I braced my shoulders...\n...and both of us froze where we stood. A sound separated itself from that dull roar, penetrating my awareness with an irresistible force. No one who'd heard that sound before could have reacted differently.\nA pack of Mandars was storming through the town.\n\u201cTruce,\u201d soldier-boy gurgled, so low it was almost a whisper. I nodded, and relaxed my stance.\nWe stood there for a few seconds of frozen indecision, then I ran out into the night.\nI'd seen Mandars before, but always from a healthy distance. These ones now, though, some of them were so close I could have thrown a rock and hit one from where I stood.\nIf, that is, I'd had overwhelming urge to die.\nEach of them was as long as seven or eight men, their feet planted on one another's shoulders, would be tall. One of them was so close I could see the slime dripping from its body, all eight of its heads scanning for humans or other animals to eat. Its tentacles swept beneath it, supporting the mass of its body as it scuttled along the street. Every time a gob of slime fell from that body onto the ground, it exploded into blue flame and bored a hole in the cobblestones.\nFor the first time in my life, I was face to face with one of the original masters of this world.\nThis is the story of the Crash, as told to me by my father when I was small, and by his father to him, going back three hundred years.\nHumans didn't always live in this world, and perhaps some still don't. Once, they lived in another place, another world like our own, with its own oceans and suns and sky. They had machines of a kind that the priests and scholars and clock-makers of this world can only dream of, and built ships that traveled between the stars.\nSome people say that they used magic to do this, but I've never believed that. I was a clock-maker's apprentice for five years, and I know that building a machine to do an impressive thing is a matter of skill. I can believe that other men, in other times, had greater skills than our own, but I won't believe in magic until I've seen some with my own eyes.\nThese airships were a product of tremendous skill, but they weren't perfect. A fleet of five hundred of them, carrying a thousand thousand men and women who were the ancestors of every man and woman alive today, came to settle this place three centuries ago, knowing that it was a world whose air could be breathed and whose water could be drunk by human mouths.\nAs it happened, they didn't so much land as crash, and half the men and women aboard went to their deaths.\nMany ships remain to this day, preserved as monuments and tended by priests, but no one with the skill to understand what could have gone wrong with five hundred ships at once, much less to repair them and take them back to the stars, survived the crash. All that remains of that skill is hoarded among the metal men who'd been used as slaves on those airships.\nTheir former masters dead, the metal men retreated to the mountains. They live in their own cities, to which no man of flesh and blood is allowed entrance, and keep their knowledge to themselves.\nThe rest of us had to fend for ourselves, learning to farm this world's soil, to build ships to sail its oceans and to forge swords to protect ourselves against one another.\nNo one, though, has ever learned quite adequately how to protect themselves against the creatures who ruled this world before we came.\nI didn't look at these Mandars for more than a few seconds before I ran back into the temple.\nThe soldier was gone. That meant that there was an exit on the other side. I ran back to find it.\nOn my way, I almost tripped over the priest's head.\nI picked it up and, for a fleeting moment, looked into its corpse's eyes, still wide with incomprehension. I tore my gaze away and tossed the head into my shoulder pack.\nForcing the image out of my mind, I ran to the back doors of the temple and stepped out into the humid darkness.\nSmoke rose everywhere, the city's wooden buildings ablaze from the Mandar's slime. I couldn't see any Mandars from this side of the building, and the temple wasn't far from the docks. One quick sprint, and...\nI looked out into the ocean.\nThe Holy Eater of Gods, Captain Kate's ship, had already released its moorings. They were leaving without me.\nI took off as fast as I could, aching with exertion as I ran to the docks. The howling of Mandars reverberated in my ears. The warm ocean breeze beat against my face.\nI couldn't stop running. The moments it would take me to catch my breath could make the difference between my making it to the ship on time or...\nWell, best case scenario, I could find somewhere to hide until the Mandars moved on. Maybe that way I could live long enough for the townspeople to string me from the gallows for my crimes. Worst case scenario...\nBest not to think about that. I picked up my pace.\nPeople ran everywhere, crowding the docks in a blooming, buzzing confusion as they tried to get on any available ship. I paid them no mind, and vice versa. They'd kill me readily enough if I stuck around, but right now, no one had time to think about that.\nEvery ounce of my concentration was centered on the Holy Eater of Gods. It had just started to drift away from the shore.\nI waded into the warm water, then swam, keeping my head in the air as best I could. Any second now, they would put the oars to it, and there would be no way I could catch the ship.\nAs I came up to the Holy Eater's side, I screamed as loud as I could. \u201cOy there!\u201d\nIf anyone on deck heard, they didn't come. I treaded water and screamed again. \u201cHey! Damn it, Kate, hey!\u201d\nI rummaged around in my shoulder pack, the few items within it floating in water, until I found a half-empty bottle of rum. \u201cHey!\u201d I screamed again, and tossed it with all the force I could muster. It disappeared, up on the deck, and I heard a smash.\nFinally, a face and matching shoulders emerged over the railing. It was Captain Kate 498thShip, terror of the western seas, her tropical bird Christina perched on her shoulder. Kate looked neither shocked nor relieved, but amused to see me.\n\u201cFucking hell, Jake, what have I told you about wasting rum like that?\u201d\nI shook my head and smiled despite myself. \u201cYes, I am alive, Captain. I'm touched by your concern.\u201d\nKate threw back her head and laughed uproariously, her long blond hair spread out in the wind. All three of Christina's heads echoed the laugh. Kate stepped back, and a moment later two crewmen lowered a ladder to me.\nKate waited for me on deck, her arms crossed over her ample chest, her lips twitching in amusement. We stood looking at each other for a long moment, until Christina broke the silence.\n\u201cHe looks fine,\u201d Chris, the leftmost head, offered.\n\u201cNot a scratch,\u201d Ti, the middle headed, added.\n\u201cReally,\u201d Na finished, \u201cyou shouldn't have worried.\u201d\nKate knocked Christina off her shoulder with a playful swat, and shook her head. \u201cThe bird is a liar. I couldn't have cared less what happened to you.\u201d\nI shook my head in disgust. \u201cWhere would you find another man as good in a fight as me?\u201d\nKate snorted. \u201cThere are at least half a dozen men on this ship who are better at that.\u201d\n\u201cBut Captain...\u201d My voice was the very essence of wounded pride. Very tentatively--she was in fine spirits for the moment, but she was prone to abrupt and wicked changes of mood--I stepped forward to put my hands on her hips. \u201cWhere would you find another man who was as good at the other thing?\u201d\nKate pushed me away, hard, but her smile deepened. \u201cThere are a dozen men on the crew who are better at that.\u201d\nThe other mates standing around the deck snickered at that, but I paid them no mind. A moment before, I'd remembered what was in my bag.\n\u201cWell, be that as it may, I have a present for you.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d She raised one eyebrow. \u201cI like presents.\u201d\nI tossed her the holy man's head, still sopping wet with blood and sea-water. She caught it in both hands, and examined the priestly collar, still stuck to the folds of flesh just below the chin. For a long time, she gazed into the corpse's eyes, lost in thoughts I would never be able to guess. Finally, she shook her head and tossed the trophy to Jack 214thShip. He took it without comment and wandered off.\nThunder cracked in the distance. The first few drops of rain pelted the deck. Both of us ignored it.\n\u201cWell.\u201d Kate grabbed my belt buckle to pull me toward her. She was about a hundred times stronger than she looked, and my breath went out as she did it. \u201cHow did you know? It was just what I wanted.\u201d\nShe reached up to roughly grab the back of my head and then Captain Kate 498thShip, the most ferocious pirate in the western seas, the woman I was going to hell for, pulled me down into a long and lingering kiss.\nThe first time I'd met her, she hadn't been nearly so friendly.\nIt was five years to the day since my father sold me to the clock-maker. During the lull between thunderstorms on an autumn afternoon, the Holy Eater of Gods washed up on our shore. I doubt they'd have bothered raiding our little town if the storm hadn't sent them in our direction, but Captain Kate was never one to miss an opportunity.\nThe clock-maker was in the volunteer militia. When Kate's raiding party came, he resisted. I resisted too, if only to avoid the beating I knew I'd earn if I ran off during the fighting. Even if I'd had a proper sword instead of that glorified knife they'd given me, I wouldn't have known what to do with it. I learned how to do that much later, on the Holy Eater of Gods.\nKate and her boys gave us a chance to surrender. My betters refused. I fought. We lost.\nCaptain Kate herself knocked the blade out of my hands, and almost finished the job.\nI was on my back on the damp street, her sword on my neck, its point boring into my flesh. She muttered something that in the years since she has never admitted was, \u201cWhat a waste, handsome boy like that.\u201d\nOh, she's had me often enough in my years on the Holy Eater. She's had every halfway decent looking man on the crew at least once. Still, admitting a thing like that would give me notions, make me think I was something special. As such, she's always insisted it was, \u201cWhat a cowardly boy is that.\u201d\n\u201cPlease, no,\u201d I managed to say, even though working my throat to speak like that just made the sword's point hurt all the more.\n\u201cNow, son,\u201d she told me, in that suspiciously educated diction she lapses into whenever she forgets not to talk that way, \u201cI can understand your point of view, but please understand mine. I really can't spare anyone to guard you, and if I don't finish you off, you're going to alert the rest of the town.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I managed. \u201cI won't.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I would love to believe you, I truly would. But how can I be sure?\u201d\n\u201cI swear by the Goddess of the Sea,\u201d I offered. I think I'd heard in stories at the tavern that pirates swore by the Goddess of the Sea.\n\u201cTry again.\u201d Kate spoke from between her teeth, and pushed the sword further into my neck.\nI realized that there was at least one thing left to try. I won't claim that it was just survival, either, that made me say what I did.\nIn that split-second of decision, a lot of things rushed through my mind. I had ten years left on my term of service. Even if the clock-maker died, some butcher or shopkeeper cousin of his would inherit me. They would work me, hard, and they'd be no more shy about discipline than the clock-maker ever was.\nI thought about that, but it was a lot more than that. I thought about the way the ocean smelled, the way wind felt against my skin at night, the fact that I'd never traveled further than fifty miles in any direction from the town I grew up in.\nAnd with the next words I spoke, I committed myself to a life of thievery and murder, and bargained away my immortal soul.\n\u201cI could come with you.\u201d\nIt had rained all night, but when I woke up the morning after the Mandar attack, the first sun, William, was shining through the window of my cabin. My dreams of the previous night were already a fading memory, a jumble of water and darkness and the hollow eyes of a dead priest.\nI had my usual struggle with my parched throat, said throat insisting that I go below deck for a drink and the rest of my body pleading for another hour of sleep. The throat won.\nThe throat always wins, sooner or later.\nI stumbled below deck to the pantry, grabbing a wooden cup and a loaf of bread. I filled the cup with two parts water and one part rum, and used it to wash down the bread.\nMost of the ship hands don't bother with the water for their first drink of the morning, but Kate insists that the fighting men do so. Letting the sailors drink it straight is better for discipline, but alertness is more important than discipline for those of us expected to go on raids.\nI finished my bread, poured myself another cup of rum and water, and wandered above deck to find the Captain.\nShe stood on the railing of the ship with Tommy 214thShip, watching the second sun, James, rise in the west.\nTommy said something I couldn't quite make out. Kate threw back her head and laughed.\nI stood a ways away, wondering if I was interrupting something, but Captain Kate waved me over. She held a glass bottle of very dark rum. Her bird perched on the rail, purple and yellow striped wings spread out to take in the sun.\n\u201cMorning, Captain. Tommy.\u201d I glanced at the rum and raised my eyebrows.\nKate followed my gaze, shrugged, and took a swig directly from the bottle. \u201cI don't expect we'll see any action today. Anyway, I'm in a celebrating mood.\u201d\n\u201cYes, ma'am.\u201d\n\u201cDon't take that tone,\u201d Chris chided me.\n\u201cDisrespectful,\u201d Ti added.\n\u201cShe is the Captain,\u201d Na pointed out.\nKate snickered. \u201cFor once, the bird is talking sense. I don't know why I tolerate this level of impertinence from the likes of you.\u201d\nWhile I tried to think of a response to that, Kate poured some rum into my almost empty cup. I clinked it against her bottle, and we both took swigs. My throat burned as I gulped it down.\nI closed my eyes for a moment, savoring the spices. The Captain must have visited a nobleman's pantry the night before.\nWhen I opened my eyes back up, my vision blurred.\nTommy snickered, seeing my expression. \u201cGood kick to this stuff, eh?\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nKate rolled her eyes. \u201cThe rum, Jake.\u201d\nI smiled. \u201cPray it's the rum and not the first sign of madness.\u201d\nThe Captain back-handed me across the face. It took me a long moment to realize what I'd done wrong.\n\u201cPrayer,\u201d she explained, very calmly, \u201cis the highest form of madness. What else do you call believing yourself to be in communication with invisible beings who cater to your will?\u201d\nI nodded my agreement. Tommy interjected as I was still trying to come up with something placating to say. He pointed out at the horizon. \u201cWhat's that, then?\u201d\nI hadn't realized just how far last night's thunderstorm had blown us off-course. Almost nothing around us was recognizable. Following Tommy's gaze, I caught sight of a huge ship sliding through the water in the distance.\nIt shone so brightly that I wondered if it was made entirely of metal. For a certainty, it looked expensive, and no flag or marking identified it as either military or another brigand ship. Only one conclusion could follow from those two premises. \u201cI guess we'll see some action today after all.\u201d\nKate nodded vigorously, her face the picture of joyful anticipation, and turned around to bark orders at anyone in shouting distance. I went off to find my sword and splash cold water in my face.\nHalf an hour later, we boarded the ship.\nIt was like no ship I had ever seen. It really was made entirely of metal, bow to stern, deck to hull. The deck was entirely flat, with no wheel, no ropes, not even a sail. Whatever was left of an apprentice clock-maker in me couldn't stop wondering how it worked.\nLogic said that a ship with no sails should drift aimlessly. My eyes said this one slid through the water at a good pace.\nRight now, we had more important things to worry about. There were people everywhere on deck. And not just people.\nThere were metal men.\nComing upon a metal man walking around outside of one of their mountain strongholds was a marvel, the sort of thing people told stories about in taverns, but it wasn't unheard of. Seeing one in the company of human beings, though? That approached the realm of the impossible.\nNever mind that, even, the people were odd enough by themselves. They wore strange clothes, black and rubbery, shining in the sun. Some of them held devices of a kind I had never seen before, and whose purpose I couldn't begin to fathom.\nThe strangest thing was that none of them were armed, and none seemed to be alarmed by the presence of Captain Kate 498thShip and a dozen men, all of us carrying swords, standing on their deck.\nOne called out to us in some sort of foreign language. We all stared at each other in confusion. Kate shrugged, and started the usual speech. \u201cYou are under the custody of the Holy Eater of Gods. If you surrender your goods, you may keep your wretched lives. If you resist, this is the day you die.\u201d\nOne of the men in the strange black suits walked up to us, so close that I could have killed him by stretching out my arm. He spoke again in the foreign language and then, as if embarrassed to have forgotten a social courtesy, he shook his head and took something out of his pocket. It was a gray, metallic thing, with a button in the middle. He pressed the button and began again to speak.\nHis mouth moved as before, but this time, his voice came from everywhere at once and nowhere in particular, like he was speaking directly into my head. What's more, he was speaking ordinary Kingspeech. \u201cGreetings. My name is Commander Amson Beck. We are on an exploratory mission from the Earthspace Colonial Authority. We will return to our\u201d--he paused for a moment, and then continued--\u201dairship, once we are done with this expedition. I regret that we cannot spare any of the goods on this vessel, but I mean no disrespect to your local customs.\u201d\nFor the first time in the years that I had known her, Kate's mouth was open, but no words were coming out. Finally...\n\u201cAirship?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cYou're lying.\u201d\n\u201cI'm not,\u201d the voice assured her.\n\u201cI don't like liars.\u201d\nI braced myself when I heard that, gripping my sword in both hands. Anyone who'd ever been on a raid with Captain Kate knew what was coming next when she said a thing like that.\nShe lifted her sword. At the same moment, one of the metal men pointed its arm at her.\nIn the split-second before she had time to slice off the speaker's head, a beam of green light shot out of the metal man's hand, and pierced Kate between her eyes.\nHer sword clattered to the deck. She sank to her knees. She teetered there for a moment, her teeth chattering, sweat beading down her forehead. Then she collapsed.\nThe dull roar of silence started in my ears. I raised my sword.\n\u201cStop,\u201d the voice-from-nowhere told me. I stopped, as much out of wonder as out of fear. At that moment, I saw something out the corner of my eye that could not be.\nThree of my shipmates failed to heed the command. They rushed forward around me, oblivious to the wonder across the ship. Three beams of green light stopped them. My hands quivered with rage around my sword, but I held still, stopped by awe as much as fear.\nOn the other end of the ship, quite oblivious to our altercation, a woman in a black rubber suit was holding a large bag, made out of some sort of transparent, stretchy substance. A tag was stuck to the bag, with foreign symbols written on it.\nThe bag held the severed head of a Mandar.\n\u201cDon't worry,\u201d the voice-from-nowhere told me as the speaker followed my gaze. \u201cWe are only taking a few samples of the local wildlife. Your ecosystem shouldn't be affected.\u201d\nI opened my mouth. I closed it again.\nI tore my eyes away from the captive monstrosity. Instead, I looked at Kate's body, lying limp on the metallic deck. I felt my hands tighten on the handle of my sword.\n\u201cShe's not dead.\u201d\nIn the most absurd day of my life, that made the least sense of all. Why would he try to tell me that? I had just seen the metal man kill her.\n\u201cShe's asleep.\u201d\nI stared. I closed my eyes, opened them back up and stared some more. It was true. I could see her breast rise and fall. Sleep.\n\u201cAll four of your friends are asleep. We will return them to your vessel. We have no desire to interfere.\u201d\n\u201cWait.\u201d\nI didn't know I was going to say that it until I did.\nIn that split-second of decision, all sorts of things rushed through my mind. The faces of the people I'd killed. How much I'd like not to merit residence in quite such a deep and fiery ring of hell when I died. How much I'd like to have a different life.\nI thought about all of that, but there was more. I also thought about the way the stars look on a clear night, and how much I'd like to fly.\n\u201cI could come with you.\u201d\nAfter a month of traveling the oceans with the men from the stars, and six weeks of intensive study, more numbers and words and facts than my old master clock-maker would have been able to hold in his head, I was on board the airship.\nAn actual airship, like the ones I'd seen preserved from the Crash, but more advanced. The inside was all sleek surfaces and shining displays. It hurt my eyes just to look at it all, but I didn't ever want to stop.\nJust before we took off, I asked them to open up the hatch. The take-off pad was only a few yards from the water's edge, more than close enough.\nI threw my arm back, and tossed my sword into the sea.\nLater, I watched the world, the entire world, become smaller and smaller through the window until it was tiny green ball and then until it disappeared altogether. It was the most frightening and the most breathtaking thing I'd ever seen, but I already knew that I'd see more amazing things before long.\nI couldn't wait.\nMy name is Jake 259thShip, and I am a traveler among the stars.\nBen Burgis is a graduate student in the Philosophy Department at the University of Miami and an adjunct professor at Miami-Dade College.

The towers reached to the dizzying light of heaven, blocking out the sun. Each one was a masterpiece of functionalist architecture, cold, dismal and empty. Companies needing office space looked outwards instead to the redbrick suburbs, and the Ministry of Appropriations, forced to occupy one of the grey blocks, was notorious for inefficiency. But from the rooftops the air-raid sirens could be heard for miles, a distorted melody backed by the percussion of distant artillery.\nIn the square figures shuffled from stall to stall, huddling round products even the war had not consumed. Old ladies in shawls prodded vigorously at wrinkled apples then complained that they were bruised. A mother berated a penniless stallholder, demanding a refund for cleaning fluids that left greasy smears across her windows. Another fretted around her screeching daughter, offering dollies and candy canes if she would be quiet. Outside the Ministry of Appropriations a street sweeping van belched black exhaust soot. All of them ignored the siren\u2019s wail, made indifferent to its warning by countless practices and false alarms.\nA bomber buzzed low and angry over the rooftops, onlookers gawping upwards as it hurled its load into the heart of the square. A thought bomb burst open, showering the place with lettered casing and infectious memes. Concepts hurtled through the air, embedding themselves in shoppers and stallholders. There was panic as the victims found their minds invaded by new and outrageous ideas, confusing and contradicting the reality to which they held. Raw, unexpected perspectives overwhelmed a decade\u2019s dogged resistance, stubborn habits receding in the face of reality\u2019s shifting front line. Some victims, startled into panic by their own discordant thoughts, ran off through the monotone grid of streets, spreading the word in their wake. The rest simply sat down, stunned into surrender by the unending, bloodthirsty futility of violence. The bomb had riddled them with doubts, shown its victims the self-defeating horror of war, the pointlessness of resistance.\nThe idea spread through town like a contagion, carrying its symptom of silence. Homes, offices, schools, all fell quiet. The handles of sirens ceased to turn, radios hissed with static as local stations gave up educating the indifferent masses. Cars sat dormant in the street, their drivers gazing at each other in stillness. By dusk the distant guns of the front line had ceased their brutal barking. For the first time in years, an owl could be heard.\nTwo days later the tanks rolled into town, a grime-streaked victory parade as the opposition sealed their success. Scouts ran ahead of them, darting from one doorway to the next as they watched warily for signs of resistance. Not a finger was lifted against them, citizens watching passively as gunmen stormed their homes and stole their food.\nThe whole town had an eerie, ghostlike feel, draped in a quiet made not of calm or comfort but of hopelessness and inertia. The invaders initially prowled the streets with a wary determination, rifles at the ready, eyes darting back and forth as they swept through silent buildings or patrolled the deserted, wind-swept roads. The locals went wordlessly about their work, heads bowed, shoulders hunched, as though bent low by a great weight. They went outside only when necessary, and talked in hushed whispers when it became necessary to buy their bread and milk. The soldiers watched them nervously, at first afraid that they might rise into armed revolt, then wary of the unnerving, lifeless silence. But fed, sheltered and safe from any sign of resistance, the war-weary troopers began to relax.\nThe soldiers\u2019 orders were clear \u2013 no fraternising. But set a rule and you set someone a challenge.\n\u2018It\u2019s not fraternising if we don\u2019t talk, right?\u2019 a private said, watching a pretty blonde walk by, long green dress swaying enticingly with each step. His comrades smirked knowingly to each other as he followed the girl down an alley and grabbed her by the arm.\n\u2018Doesn\u2019t seem safe,\u2019 he said, \u2018pretty thing like you out on your own.\u2019\nHe leaned in close, stubble rasping at her cheek, hands reaching round her unresisting waist, fingertips caressing her curves. She reached up, tilted his helmet aside and began to whisper in his ear. He ceased his fumbling. Arms fell slack by his sides. At last she fell silent, gazing into his eyes. He nodded, turned, and walked numbly back towards his companions, rifle trailing in the gutter. The squad huddled around him, eyes flitting back and forth, glancing warily at their friend then nervously over their shoulders. He spoke, and one by one the camouflaged huddle ceased to twitch their heads, sinking into apathy or setting off in determination, spreading the word through their unit and beyond.\nSilence crept along the war\u2019s front line. The sharp chatter of small-arms gave way to crickets chirping on the breeze. Bombers idled on disused runways and tanks gathered dust. All across the continent owls could be heard.\nAndrew lives in Macclesfield, England.

L. Morganfield\nThe messenger arrived just as Emperor Cuauht\u00e9moc sat down to a humble breakfast of blood soup and raw fish with his Inuit hosts. \"A message for you, Revered Speaker, concerning the Cihuac\u00f3atl,\" the messenger said as he pulled a folded piece of paper from a leather satchel at his side. Fresh snow dripped off his wolf-skin coat in the heat of the small hut.\nCuauht\u00e9moc opened the note, expecting to see his friend Ixtlilxochitl's immaculate scrawl, but instead found most of the letter had been written by his camp supervisor, Elotl. The Cihuac\u00f3atl has been injured, Revered Speaker, and he requests your presence back at camp, it read. But at the bottom, in barely legible scribble were the words, \"Please come soon. Ixtlil.\"\nCuauht\u00e9moc read the note over and over, his mind reeling over what it might mean. He stuffed the paper into the pocket of his caribou-skin robe and hurried to his feet. \"I must leave immediately.\"\nThe sons of the chief prepared a sled of their fastest dogs and the Emperor departed, leaving behind his servants and even his bodyguards in favor of making better time.\nWhat I wouldn't do for an airplane or a truck right now, he thought as the sled struggled through the deep snow, hour after hour. Anything to get to Ixtlil quicker.\nBut such wishful thinking accomplished nothing; in his one hundred and fifty years since taking the throne in Tenochtitl\u00e1n, he'd turned the One World into the most technologically advanced nation in the world, but wonders such as automobiles and airplanes were still another hundred years away. He'd been so careful to introduce change slowly, when he felt his people were ready for it; great empires couldn't be built in a rush after all and thanks to the nanites that made him immortal, he had plenty of time. What was most important was keeping the One World ahead of the English and the Germans and the Italians, to keep these enemies from making footholds in his lands. It was what the nanites had programmed him to do; to protect the One World from them.\nBut now he cursed his lack of foresight; he should have at least assigned a team of mechanics to work on prototypes of vehicles, for his own personal use. For just these kinds of situations. He couldn't stop thinking about Ixtlil's shaky writing. It didn't make sense. Ixtlil had the nanites, just like him\u2014the only other person in the whole empire who did\u2014and for him to have suffered an injury they couldn't fix\u2026. Every time Cuauht\u00e9moc stopped to let the dogs rest and eat, he cursed himself some more and hoped he wouldn\u2019t arrive too late to help his friend.\nThe exhausted dogs pulled him into the camp on the shore of the western bay under the near perpetual night two days later. He nodded to the fur-clad warriors who greeted him with hoots as he hurried through the clusters of canvas tents, his polar-bear fur cape flapping in the brisk wind. He didn't stop until he threw aside the flap on the medical tent.\nThe camp supervisor Elotl met him just inside, relief plain on his face. \"What happened?\" Cuauht\u00e9moc asked as Elotl helped him shrug off his heavy coat.\n\"The Russians,\" Elotl replied. \"The night after you left, they brought their ships across the bay and bombarded the edge of camp, so we sent our own ships out after them. We thought we'd chased them all away, but a few came on foot, through the forest. They'd dressed as eagle warriors and snuck through camp, right to your tent, and fired into it. They killed three of your servants before we realized what was happening. The Cihuac\u00f3atl was shot several times in the attack.\"\nCuauht\u00e9moc frowned. \"They knew which tent was mine?\" His tent always looked the same as the rest of the army's, so the enemy couldn't just pick it off with artillery fire, and he often switched to other tents under the cover of dark, as added security. Very few people knew where or when he would switch tents.\nElotl nodded. \"There's a traitor in your army, Revered Speaker,\" he said in a low voice. \"We captured several of the Russians but they've refused to speak to our interpreter.\"\n\"I will take care of it,\" Cuauht\u00e9moc said.\nIxtlilxochitl\u2014the governor of Texc\u00f3co and Cuauht\u00e9moc's vice-ruler\u2014lay on a cot in the corner of the tent, shivering under the pile of blankets covering him. His youngest and only living son Nextlalli stood at the foot of the bed, watching his father with a frown. He was better dressed for the tropical climate of his home than the bitter coldness of the north; he held his bare arms crossed and wore a thin cotton mantle decorated with row upon row of white and brown eagle feathers.\nIn the other corner of the tent, a young boy sat on a stool next to a tall wooden box, sweating as he turned a crank on its side to generate electricity for the single bulb dangling from a wire stretched to the middle tent pole. The surgeon, who'd been wiping the sweat from Ixtlil's forehead, bowed to Cuauht\u00e9moc as he approached. \"He's still alive, Revered Speaker,\" the surgeon said. \"But he's lost a lot of blood and he's only grown sicker by the day.\" He shifted his gaze to Nextlalli for a moment before adding, \"I'm afraid there's nothing more I can do for him. He's in the hands of the gods now.\"\nCuauht\u00e9moc pulled up a stool next to the cot and lit a lantern on the table. \"Leave us,\" he said, and the surgeon and the boy departed.\nNextlalli stayed at the foot of the bed though, until Elotl cleared his throat and told him, \"Everyone.\" Nextlalli bowed to Cuauht\u00e9moc then gave his father one last look before whirling away and disappearing out the tent flap into the gray morning. Elotl followed.\nCuauht\u00e9moc set his fingers on Ixtlil's wrist, feeling his pulse. It thudded so fast it was amazing he still lived at all. His friend groaned, his breathing rapid but shallow. Septicemia, Cuauht\u00e9moc concluded then pulled back the blankets to look at the wound. Blood and puss oozed through the cotton dressing across Ixtlil's lower abdomen and swirls of yellow and red soaked the bandage at the back of his head. The smell of rotting flesh spoke of more than just a minor infection. Judging from the filthy water in the basin next to the bed\u2014no doubt used to clean the wounds\u2014it was no wonder Ixtlil's nanites couldn't keep up with the spread of the bacteria now killing him. The surgeon was right. There was nothing to be done for the man. Not even by Cuauht\u00e9moc. He felt unable to breathe.\nHe covered the shivering body and set a gentle hand on his friend's sweating forehead. \"Ixtlil?\" He repeated the name several times before Ixtlil finally opened his eyes and looked at him. It took a moment for him to focus, but then a weak smile crept to his face.\n\"You made it.\"\n\"Of course I'd be here,\" Cuauht\u00e9moc said, struggling with his own smile. \"How do you feel?\"\n\"Like I was mauled by a jaguar \u2026 again.\"\n\"Elotl told me what happened. I will make the Russians pay for this, friend. That's a promise. I will make you a cape of their skins, just like I did with the jaguar.\"\n\"And I'll wear it when we invade their camp and crush them into the ice.\" Ixtlil tried to laugh but it turned into loud coughing and violent shakes. Cuauht\u00e9moc had to hold his shoulders down to help him calm. \"I'm so glad you're here,\" he whispered, his face ashen and his lips trembling. \"Is there anything you can do for me? Like before?\"\n\"This is much different than last time,\" Cuauht\u00e9moc replied. He'd been with Ixtlil when the jaguar lunged at them from the jungle while they were hunting deer. Back then Cuauht\u00e9moc hadn't had to travel for days to get to him; no infection had had time to set in and begin destroying Ixtlil from the inside. Death hadn't been this close last time. \"You've lost a lot of blood, friend,\" Cuauht\u00e9moc told him.\n\"Nothing a god can't cure,\" Ixtlil said with half-hearted chuckle.\nThey'd had often joked about Cuauht\u00e9moc being considered a god; he'd more than once hear the common folk refer to him as Huitzilopochtli or even Quetzalc\u00f3atl\u2014some even thought Ixtlil was Tezcatlipoca, the patron god of Texc\u00f3co\u2014but today the comment left him cold. For years he'd enjoyed the power such superstitions granted him, the way people obeyed his orders as if they were the words of a god, their trust in him implicit, but at this moment, he'd never felt so un-godlike and helpless.\n\"I will do what I can for you,\" he said. Ixtlil gripped Cuauht\u00e9moc's hand with his own trembling one, its strength fading with each second. \"I will make it painless, I promise.\" He choked on the words.\nTaking his hand from Ixtlil's, Cuauht\u00e9moc cut his palm with the surgeon's knife, pulled back the blanket and the bandage, and let the blood drip into his friend's wound. He couldn't give him enough nanites to save him\u2014not without bleeding himself to death\u2014but these new nanites would help ease his suffering. With just a thought, he'd reprogrammed these few million to sever the pain receptors in Ixtlil's brain, so his friend could die peacefully once they began work shutting down his organs. They would spread the orders to all the other nanites in his body and death would come soon after.\nCuauht\u00e9moc had lost wives, lost children, seen many people die in the hundred and fifty years he'd lived, but this time left him shaken. Not even the death of his favorite wife a hundred years ago had struck him with this intensity. It's because Ixtlil isn't supposed to die, Cuauht\u00e9moc though, bitterness creeping up on him. Giving his friend the nanites in the first place had been a simple decision. Ixtlil was already as dedicated to the good of the empire and her destiny as Cuauht\u00e9moc himself, religiously devoted it seemed. Ixtlil was the only person Cuauht\u00e9moc had ever found trustworthy enough to share such a precious and potentially dangerous gift with.\nBut then there were some things that even the miracle of nanites couldn't repair.\nThe two men passed the minutes talking about Cuauht\u00e9moc's missions to build alliances with the scattered Inuit populations. He'd created treaties with a dozen so far, all willing to take up arms against any European or Asian nation attempting to invade through their lands. They'd also agreed to let Cuauht\u00e9moc garrison troops with them, to help against the invaders' superior numbers.\n\"The smallpox has already ravaged several of their villages,\" Cuauht\u00e9moc told Ixtlil. \"So they're just as eager to be rid of the Russians as we are.\"\n\"I always loved that part, where we'd go visit the different tribes and make friends,\" Ixtlil said. \"I really looked forward to the day when I'd see us all united, from the farthest south all the way to here in the north, united in common cause and friendship. But I guess I won't be here for that.\" He sighed, and then said, \"I'm sorry I let you down, Cuauht\u00e9moc.\"\n\"You didn't,\" Cuauht\u00e9moc replied. He was happy to see that his friend's mind was very clear and focused\u2014a sign the nanites had quelled the pain that had drained so much of his spirit before\u2014but it also meant the nanites had gone on to their final work. At best he had only a few minutes left with Ixtlil. He squeezed his friend's hand as if it would keep back the rising pain in his chest.\n\"Will you grant me a dying request?\" Ixtlil asked.\n\"Of course.\"\n\"Share the gift you gave me with my son. He will be a good Cihuac\u00f3atl. He's a little brash, but he believes in the plan. He knows we must all work together and stop all the petty infighting if we're to keep the Europeans out. He will do what you ask of him. I know he will.\"\nCuauht\u00e9moc couldn't argue with him. Nextlalli was an excellent soldier and everyone thought he could look forward to a long, decorated military career; not like some of Cuauht\u00e9moc's sons, who would rather laze around the palace in Tenochtitl\u00e1n and accept the life of luxury their lineage afforded them. Still, the gift wasn't something to be given lightly\u2026\nBefore Cuauht\u00e9moc could answer, Ixtlil lunged up, almost out of the bed, gasping for breath and grabbing frantically at his chest. Cuauht\u00e9moc took hold of him, feeling his wrist. His friend's pulse had risen even further out of control than before, faltering then quickening again. He hugged him tight and whispered, \"I promise, if that's what you want, friend.\"\nIn answer, Ixtlil slumped against Cuauht\u00e9moc's shoulder, his pulse shrinking to nothing. Cuauht\u00e9moc held him the whole time, unable to breathe himself.\nWhen Cuauht\u00e9moc returned to his tent, he sent one of his surviving servants to fetch Nextlalli. He then stood next to the far wall, examining the tears in the black canvas left by the bullets. Elotl had offered to put him into a new tent but Cuauht\u00e9moc insisted on keeping this one, with its reminders of what had happened.\nNextlalli arrived wearing his full eagle knight uniform\u2014a coat of feathers and a stiff hood made to look like an eagle head. He also carried his father's ceremonial macuahuitl sword. It had a polished mahogany handle carved with serpents inlayed with rubies for their eyes. Cuauht\u00e9moc had given it to his friend as a gift of comradeship and allegiance even before he'd made Ixtlil immortal.\n\"You called for me, Revered Speaker?\" Nextlalli asked, gazing up at the Emperor from his kneeling position.\nCuauht\u00e9moc leaned against his oak desk and nodded. \"Your father has passed on.\"\n\"The surgeon told me,\" Nextlalli replied.\n\"Did you have an opportunity to speak with him before I arrived?\"\nNextlalli nodded. \"I spent all but his final minutes at his side.\"\n\"Did he discuss his final wishes with you?\"\n\"He said he would ask you to make me your next Cihuac\u00f3atl.\"\nCuauht\u00e9moc nodded. \"Did he explain to you what that would entail?\"\n\"He said you could share your blood with me and make me a god, just as you did for him.\"\n\"That is one way to explain it,\" Cuauht\u00e9moc admitted. \"But you'll think much different of it once you have it.\" He reached over the desk and opened the top drawer. From it he took a metal blade sitting among the quills and rolls of parchment. \"We must talk first though. The gift I'm to bestow isn't one to be given lightly and I must be sure you understand the consequences of accepting it.\"\n\"Of course, Revered Speaker.\"\n\"Did your father tell you why I gave him my gift of immortality?\"\n\"The two of you were hunting in the jungle and he was attacked by a jaguar\u2014\"\n\"Yes, but that's not why I gave it to him. It's very important for you to understand the why.\"\nNextlalli clasped his hands together over his left knee as he knelt. \"He did not.\"\n\"Your father and I had been friends for a very long time, since childhood. We attended calm\u00e9cac together in Texc\u00f3co and we both captured our first sacrificial victims during the same battle. But when his father died, my uncle Motecuhzoma blocked his ascension to the throne of Texc\u00f3co, playing dangerous games with our long-time allies. It was an action I knew would come back to haunt the empire if it wasn't corrected.\n\"After Motecuhzoma died in the palace fire, I convinced the new emperor Cuitl\u00e1huac to return control of Texc\u00f3co to its rightful prince. That cemented your father's loyalty to me and my plans for the future. He provided half of the troops that helped invade the Spanish settlements on the islands off our coast, helped squash them before they could establish a foothold in our realm.\"\nNextlalli shifted from one knee to the other. \"We learned about that in calm\u00e9cac.\"\n\"But did they teach you the significance of it, and what it says about why we as a people are still here today?\" Cuauht\u00e9moc asked. \"The defeat of a few Spanish colonies didn't ensure our future.\"\n\"No, I suppose not,\" Nextlalli admitted.\n\"It's all about loyalty,\" Cuauht\u00e9moc continued. \"And creating friendships and allegiances for the good of all involved. Our past of petty fighting with our neighbors\u2014and even with our own allies\u2014would have shoved us under the wheels of time, forgotten except as a strange and brutal curiosity thankfully gone. Your father and I built this empire on loyalty; without it everything will crumble. Diligence is important too, but loyalty is everything: loyalty to the people you aim to rule and their well-being; loyalty to the cause of protecting the empire and expanding it not through conquest but through friendship and mutual respect; and loyalty to the fact that its necessary to put the good of the empire before yourself and your own personal wishes and ambitions.\n\"Are you willing to embrace this responsibility, Nextlalli, and devote the rest of your life to it, as your own father did?\"\n\"I will,\" Nextlalli replied without hesitation.\nCuauht\u00e9moc dragged the knife over his palm. \"Give me your hand, Prince of Texc\u00f3co.\"\nNextlalli held out his left hand. Cuauht\u00e9moc set the blood-covered blade across the young man's palm and then closed the fingers around it. \"Loyalty to the empire,\" he said.\n\"Loyalty to the empire,\" Nextlalli repeated, and then Cuauht\u00e9moc yanked the knife out, slicing open Nextlalli's hand. The young man didn't flinch at all.\n\"It will take a few days to take effect,\" Cuauht\u00e9moc said. \"Be warned though that it will not be a pleasant experience. There will be times when you'll wish you were dead just to stop the pain.\"\nCuauht\u00e9moc still remembered his own ordeal with vivid detail; the cooking fever, the seizures, the dementia that made the walls of his room in his uncle's palace look as if they were melting like hot copal wax; all from what he thought at the time was a simple snake bite while he campaigned in the south against the Tlaxcalans. He'd been sleeping off the effects of a night of celebrating with too much octli when the seemingly ordinary black serpent had slithered into his tent and under his blankets, where it bit him on the left calf. It held on until Cuauht\u00e9moc found his sword and cut off its head. He'd stared at lights flashing inside the body for a few minutes before his own drunkenness pulled him back into sleep. When he awoke the next afternoon, he found the serpent lying on the ground next to his bed, its head still attached by a single silver sinew; only much later did he realize it was a machine with needles for fangs, for injecting the nanites, a contraption sent from the ether of a future that had not yet happened.\nBy nightfall, he'd grown weak and unable to walk. Once the seizures began, a small detachment of warriors had carried him back to Tenochtitl\u00e1n. For days he was convinced that he'd in fact died and was making the torturous journey to Mictlan, crawling over blades of obsidian and running through a downpour of arrowheads raining from the sky. He'd stood at the frozen lake in Mictlan and watched images of horror and destruction play upon its icy surface; the stoning death of the Emperor Motecuhzuma the Younger who'd allowed invaders into the city with open arms; millions dying of smallpox; the building-by-building destruction of Tenochtitl\u00e1n; the burning of the libraries in Texcoco; their empire, their culture, their freedom, all turned to ash.\nBut he also saw visions of how to stop it all, how to overcome the Spanish invaders despite the empire's weaker weapons, and the nanites gave him knowledge of technologies to help lead his people into the future. He'd awoken from his near-death coma refreshed and full of purpose, his path laid clear before him, what he must do to save their world. That alone had made all the suffering worthwhile; a good emperor makes sacrifices for his people.\n\"I will announce your new position at the funeral tonight,\" Cuauht\u00e9moc told Nextlalli as he wrapped his hand with a handkerchief. \"Leave your father's sword and I will present it to you at the ceremony, as a symbol of the office I'm bestowing on you.\"\nNextlalli set the sword on the desk and Cuauht\u00e9moc handed him a cloth for his hand as well. \"Bring it back to me when you're done with it,\" Cuauht\u00e9moc said. \"It's important to make sure anything with your blood on it is properly disposed of. You can't be too careful when making sure your new power doesn't fall into wrong hands.\" He clapped Nextlalli on the shoulder and gave him a somber smile. \"From this day forward, we are brothers.\"\n\"Brothers,\" Nextlalli agreed with a matching smile, showing off the decorative chips of turquoise in his front teeth. Cuauht\u00e9moc's own sons bore similar decoration; turquoise was a stone only worn by royalty. \"We will avenge my father's murder, right?\"\n\"With the blood of the whole Russian army,\" Cuauht\u00e9moc replied.\n\"As it should be.\"\nHe'll make a good Cihuac\u00f3atl, Cuauht\u00e9moc decided as he watched Nextlalli leave. Ixtlil would be proud.\nOnce his palm ceased bleeding, he wiped the blade and tossed the cloth onto the small brazier sitting on his desk. He lit it aflame with a match and watched it char and shrivel while he boiled a small pot of chocolate over it. He then poured his beverage into a painted clay cup and dumped the ashes into it, stirring the concoction with a polished stick. He frowned a little when he sipped, but it wasn't wise to trust even fire to destroy the nanites.\nThe Russian prisoners huddled in iron cages near the docks, shivering. They'd been stripped of their eagle warrior disguises and instead wore tattered fur-coats and boots without laces. But such accommodations shouldn't have been mistaken for compassion; they were only meant to keep the men alive long enough for them to die at the sacrifice.\nSeveral jaguar knights guarded the cages, looking nightmarish in their fanged hoods and rabbit-pelt masks. Polar bear claws adorned the fingers of their gloves. They stood straighter when Cuauht\u00e9moc approached.\nThe Emperor stood before the cages, glaring over the scrawny, terrified Russian crew. \"Which of you is in charge?\" he asked in Russian.\nThe scraggly men stared at him for a moment, speechless at first but then began muttering amongst themselves. They kept darting nervous glances at one man who sat alone in the cage closest to camp.\nCuauht\u00e9moc glared down at the man who stared back, frightened but determined to not show it. \"What were your orders, soldier?\"\nThe man raised his eyebrows. \"You speak the mother tongue.\"\n\"Better than you, I'd wager.\" Cuauht\u00e9moc sneered. \"Who told you where to find the Emperor's tent?\"\nWhen the man didn't answer, Cuauht\u00e9moc said, \"I'm not asking you to betray your countrymen; I'm only asking for the name of one of my own men who gave you this information. If you give it to me, I will show mercy on your men.\n\"But if you don't\u2026.\" He motioned to the jaguar knights and they threw opened the next cage and dragged one of the men out. They wrenched the coat from the man's shoulders, leaving him with only his trousers and one boot. He struggled against them, but they held him firm, his arms behind his back and his bare chest puffed out, his ankles chained together with steel shackles. Cuauht\u00e9moc pulled a blade from his coat pocket.\n\"If you don't, I will remove this man's heart,\" he said, tapping the man's collarbone with the flat edge of the blade. \"Did you know that a person can live for up to three minutes after removing the heart, and you can even maintain consciousness for half of that? Doesn't seem very long, I know, but then I'd imagine it could seem like eternity in the midst of all the pain and the sensation of drowning in your own blood.\"\nBut the man still didn't say anything. Cuauht\u00e9moc narrowed his eyes at him but then plunged the blade into the other man's sternum. The victim wasn't the only one screaming then. The men's horrified cries sounded tinny in the frigid air.\n\"Are you going to make me torture this poor man to death in front of your men?\" Cuauht\u00e9moc asked, his hand still on the knife handle.\n\"Tell him, Yerik!\" one of the soldiers begged, pressing his face against the bars of his cage.\n\"Yes, Yerik, before I become impatient again,\" Cuauht\u00e9moc said, pushing down on the blade just enough to make the man howl.\n\"I don't know his name,\" Yerik sputtered. \"I didn't speak to him or his interpreter. I took my orders from my captain.\"\n\"But you saw him?\"\nYerik nodded. \"He wore one of those feathered uniforms, and he had gold stripes painted across his face, like so.\" He smeared his fingers across his eyes on both sides. \"And his ears had large holes in them, big enough to hook a thumb through.\"\nThe description sounded like any eagle warrior in the ranks. \"Anything else unusual?\" Cuauht\u00e9moc asked, his impatience growing.\nYerik thought for a moment before sputtering, \"Yes, he had blue teeth, in the front.\"\n\"Blue teeth?\"\n\"His four front teeth, on the top, had blue in them.\"\n\"You mean like blue gems?\"\n\"Yes, but they didn't sparkle. More like rocks.\"\nTurquoise, Cuauht\u00e9moc realized, both shocked and outraged. After all his talk about how important it was to not let the nanites fall into the wrong hands\u2026. \"He told your captain to kill me?\"\n\"And your commander,\" Yerik replied. The words made Cuauht\u00e9moc tremble and clench his fists. \"This man\u2014who came with the Inuit interpreter\u2014he promised he would move the army back south and leave us alone.\"\nOf all of the betrayals, that was the worse. It was one thing to remove an inept ruler for the good of the empire\u2014he'd done that himself with Motecuhzoma\u2014but to hand native lands over to the Russians\u2026at least Ixtlil didn't live long enough to see what a treasonous serpent his son was. \"The army will be on the move again, but we're going to come north and wipe out your base camp. We will spare no one. Never shall your Empress\u2014or anyone who succeeds her\u2014ever see Russian colonies on this continent,\" Cuauht\u00e9moc hissed. \"These lands are not free for your taking.\"\nHe pulled a revolver from his coat and sent the man he'd stabbed crumbling to the ground, bleeding from the head. He then turned it on the other Russians, stopping once to reload while Yerik babbled and pleaded for him to stop. When he'd shot the last of Yerik's men, he turned the pistol on Yerik.\n\"You said you'd show them mercy,\" the Russian sobbed through half-frozen snot and tears.\n\"I did,\" Cuauht\u00e9moc replied. \"Now they won't have to face death on the sacrificial stone tonight.\" He then pulled the trigger one last time.\nBack at his tent, he paced for a moment then told his servant boy to fetch Elotl. He had much to do before the ceremony that evening.\nWorkers had built Ixtlilxochitl's funeral pyre on the cold beach below some shallow cliffs to the south of camp. Half of the army marched in procession, with four of the strongest soldiers carrying the former Cihuac\u00f3atl on a litter across their shoulders. He sat upright, wearing his jaguar knight uniform, but also wrapped in the royal robes of Texc\u00f3co. The traditional headdress of long, emerald quetzal feathers bobbed as his head nodded with each step.\nNextlalli followed close behind the litter, dressed in his eagle knight regalia and dragging a distracted malamute puppy behind him. The head priest had dyed the dog's white fur brown, in accordance with ancient tradition, for a brown dog was needed if the deceased wished to cross the Black River in the underworld. The puppy bounded through the snow, rolling around and nipping at Nextlalli's heels.\nCuauht\u00e9moc walked a few paces behind Nextlalli, dressed in his soberest crimson robe. In the absence of flowers, his servants threw pine needles on the ground for him to walk on. Behind him, by a few steps, came Elotl, dressed in his best hooded jaguar cape and a decorative silver breast plate, presented to him by Cuauht\u00e9moc just hours before.\nOnce the procession reached the beach, the warriors set the litter atop the pyre's giant wooden platform. Nextlalli tied the dog's rope to a log. Cuauht\u00e9moc muttered a final goodbye to his friend then scratched the puppy's ears and fed it a piece of meat. The drug inside would kill the dog within minutes, so it wouldn't know the pain of dying by fire.\nWhile the army gathered on the beach, Cuauht\u00e9moc and Elotl followed Nextlalli back up the cliff overlooking the pyre. The camp priest waited there for them, dressed in his rank-smelling black robes. His blood-wetted hair glistened in the firelight from two kettle braziers. He bowed to Cuauht\u00e9moc as the Emperor passed by, to stand at the cliff's edge with Nextlalli. Below, drums boomed to bring order.\nTo begin the ceremony, the priest notched his ears with a knife as a blood offering and he sang a hymn to the War God while the small army band played flutes and drums in accompaniment. Once everyone fell silent, Cuauht\u00e9moc raised his arms and announced, \"Let us honor your fallen war chief with a song of the venerable Nezahualc\u00f3yotl.\"\nThe warriors stamped their feet and the drums pounded, creating the beat. Cuauht\u00e9moc turned to Nextlalli and said, \"Start us off, if you would. 'There are Fresh and Fragrant Flowers among the Groves'.\"\nNextlalli cleared his throat then delivered the first lines in a near-perfect tozquitl\u2014the harsh contra-bass sound most desirable for singing poetry. He'd sung in all the festivals since he was boy, much to his father's delight. Such a waste of something wonderful, Cuauht\u00e9moc thought with bitterness then he joined in the song within a few lines:\nThe fleeting pomps of the world are like the green willow trees, which, aspiring to permanence, are consumed by a fire, fall before the axe, are upturned by the wind, or are scarred and saddened by age.\nThe warriors down on the beach now joined in, all doing their best to match Nextlalli's voice. The stern, haunting sound reminded Cuauht\u00e9moc of a jaguar warning trespassers in the jungle. If the Russians were nearby, they would surely shiver and hide in their camp.\nThe grandeurs of life are like the flowers in color and in fate; their beauty and glory fail, and the brilliant gay colors which decked forth their pride wither and fade.\nBoth Cuauht\u00e9moc and Nextlalli lit torches from the braziers and tossed them over the cliff down to the pyre below. Cuauht\u00e9moc watched the flames consume Ixtlil's royal robes, engulfing his body in fiery glory.\nAll things of earth have an end, and in the midst of the most joyous lives, the breath falters, they fall, they sink into the ground.\n\"All the earth is a grave, and none escapes it,\" Cuauht\u00e9moc muttered. The knot in his throat had grown so tight he couldn't sing another word.\nOnce the air fell silent, Cuauht\u00e9moc announced to the crowd, \"As Ixtlilxochitl leaves us to begin his new wondrous life serving Tonantiuh in His daily task of warming the earth and feeding our crops, it is time to honor him and the gods with a sacrifice.\" He then nodded to Elotl, who seized Nextlalli by the neck from behind with a flowery garland. He dragged him struggling to the stone altar workers had erected when the army first made camp four months before. The surface was slick with the frozen blood of numerous sacrifices.\nNextlalli reached for his weapon, but Cuauht\u00e9moc took his hand off with one swipe of Ixtlil's sword, shattering quite a few of the delicate but ultra-sharp obsidian shards that made up the blade.\n\"At least your father didn't live to learn of your betrayal,\" Cuauht\u00e9moc said. \"Conspiring with the enemy to assassinate not only me, but your father as well? If you're fool enough to believe I wouldn't find out, then you've proven yourself unworthy of ruling this empire. A competent ruler would have made sure both his targets were in camp, so he could eliminate both at the same time.\"\nDown on the beach, the warriors muttered to each other in confusion.\n\"You should be outraged, brothers,\" Cuauht\u00e9moc shouted to them as he came to the cliff's edge again. \"This traitor planned to throw away everything your fathers and grandfathers and their fathers fought and died for. He would have our temples burned to the ground and our cities reduced to rubble, your wives enslaved and your children taught to forsake your gods and speak in foreign tongues, all so he could play Emperor. Your Cihuac\u00f3atl deserved better than the death he dealt to him.\" He pointed back at Nextlalli with Ixtlil's sword. \"You deserve better than the future he would have sentenced you to.\"\nThe muttering had turned to outraged shouts and warriors raising their guns and ceremonial swords into the air, calling for the sacrifice. Cuauht\u00e9moc went back to the stone and pulled a bag of the potent drug yauhtli from his robe pocket. He motioned the priest to join him. \"Hold his mouth open.\" When Cuauht\u00e9moc began sprinkling the powder in Nextlalli's mouth and Nextlalli struggled to spit it out, Cuauht\u00e9moc told him, \"Take your medicine. You don't wish to die in agony, like your father did.\"\nCuauht\u00e9moc finished emptying of the bag, leaving Nextlalli coughing and sneezing dust. Elotl dragged him off the stone, towards the cliff. Cuauht\u00e9moc followed, stopping next to Nextlalli, who struggled to stand straight once Elotl let him go. He stared at the young man for a moment, trying for coldness but failing.\n\"Perhaps I should have cut your feet off and bound you to a tree in woods for the wolves and bears; the nanites would keep you alive long enough to make you wish I'd never given them to you,\" Cuauht\u00e9moc said. \"But I loved your father, and he loved you enough to not want something so horrendous for you, and so neither do I.\" He grasped Nextlalli by the shoulders. \"I'm sorry it had to end this way.\"\n\"He wouldn't want you to kill me,\" Nextlalli said. He struggled to focus on Cuauht\u00e9moc's face as the yauhtli's hallucinogenic effects began taking hold.\nCuauht\u00e9moc shook his head. \"Your father believed in justice, and that those of us closest to power should be held to a higher standard than everyone else. He understood that being the Cihuac\u00f3atl sometimes means having to give your own life for the good of the empire.\" He embraced Nextlalli. \"I meant it when I said we are now brothers, so know this was a difficult decision to make. Your father thought you would make a good Cihuac\u00f3atl; it's now time to prove he was right.\"\nNextlalli seemed ready to argue some more but he stopped mid-sound, his face pale but resigned. He looked down over the edge of the cliff, the firelight reflecting off his wet cheeks. \"What son doesn't wish to be like his father?\" he muttered to himself then he looked back at Cuauht\u00e9moc, his eyes raw with regret. He closed his eyes and whispered, \"Forgive me, father.\" Then he toppled over the edge, as if falling asleep on his feet.\nThe warriors roared and Cuauht\u00e9moc watched the flames on the pyre dance with new glee, but he didn't share in the jubilee. He felt as if something more precious than mere friendship and love was burning away in the fires below.\nCuauht\u00e9moc stood atop the remains of the pyre, dressed only in trousers and boots, scrapping together the ashes on the metal sheet that had been under the wood platform. He'd been there most of the early morning hours, gathering the ash into jars to take back to camp with him. He'd be mixing ash with his drinks for weeks, and though it made everything taste like dirt, it was a small price to pay to make sure the nanites never again found themselves in an unworthy host.\nElotl\u2014his new and completely mortal Cihuac\u00f3atl\u2014had gone across the bay with the army, to wipe out the Russian camp, but he's left a few warriors to accompany Cuauht\u00e9moc to the beach, to guard him. The warriors had offered to help the Emperor with his labor, but Cuauht\u00e9moc insisted on doing it himself. Scraping up his friend's ashes was his job.\nThe hours had left him exhausted and melancholy, each shovelful of ash growing heavier than the last. Giving Ixtlil the gift was a mistake, he scolded himself. But not so much as your blind loyalty to your friendship. The empire always come first, even if it means abandoning things like friendship and camaraderie; what makes us strong one moment is our undoing the very next.\nAs he dumped the last shovelful of ash into the jar, the warriors began hooting victory and he looked up to see a fierce barrage of fireworks lighting up the night sky across the bay. It was Etotl's signal that the Russian camp had been destroyed. The news gave Cuauht\u00e9moc little comfort though. He carried the jar down to the dog sled waiting on the beach below. Two eagle warriors stood near the sled, watching the fireworks and talking.\n\"Do you suppose this will mean we can finally go back home again? These short days aren't right,\" one of them said, his voice muffled behind his fur face mask. \"There was hardly any light at all today.\"\n\"And there won't be anymore for another sixty-four days,\" Cuauht\u00e9moc said. Both warriors jumped when he spoke and rushed to help him hefted the jar up onto the sled, but he already had it situated. He climbed on the back of the sled while one of them double checked the harnesses on the yipping dogs and the other whistled to the rest of the warriors scattered about the beach.\n\"The sun truly will not rise again for that long?\" the one checking the harnesses asked.\nCuauht\u00e9moc nodded. Though for some of us, it might be far longer.\nAs the warriors gathered around the sled, Cuauht\u00e9moc snapped the reigns and started back towards camp. A good emperor makes such sacrifices, he reminded himself, though this time the thought left him cold and hollow.\nT. L.

Overall, the pilot replicates the momentum that the first 2 movies had (I'm not going to talk about the third; it was just a giant car chase). In the movies, Sarah Connor was a tough woman who was a very scary mother from hell. In the TV show she seems too feminine and too soft to be the same woman (Lena Headly was awesome in 300, but this is a real step down for her; plus she just isn't tough-looking like Linda Hamilton). Most of the characters in the TV show are cardboard cutouts who lack any real depth and add little but cannon fodder to the show (which is good since most of them seem to last only the one episode). The main characters also suffer from this 2 dimensional feel, and this is a problem since they should be building on the pre-established characters while modifying them to make them their own. They don't; instead they do a bad reinvention of them and stumble along in the process.\nIts no surprise that while watching the show I was constantly distracted by the bad writing\u2014the writers are Andromeda alumni. (Science fiction that gave us sexy warships and silly names like Tyr Anasazi.) And the casting of a sexy lithe Terminator in the form of Summer Glau may be a way to get all the scifi geeks to watch and masturbate, but it doesn't add to the credibility of the show. Why, yes, I believe the 98 lb. Terminator can beat up the 250 lb. Terminator with such ease.....not. I love Glau, she was amazing in Serenity and Firefly, but she isn't a Terminator, she's the girl John Connor falls in love with while he is being chased by Terminators. If they use her to her potential, it will mean a predictable love interest that is so hideously transparent and stupid that the writers should be shot. This show will do the 3rd movie justice\u2014it will be just as inane and uninventive as T3.

Chapman\n\"I'd like to exchange my universe.\" Irritated, Peter Norland spoke to the top of the clerk's balding head.\nThe clerk kept scratching away on his datapad. \"A moment, please.\"\nPeter had already waited an hour. \"I really must insist.\"\nWith a sigh, the clerk looked up. \"I'm sorry. What? Exchange?\"\nPeter stepped closer to the desk and leaned forward, keeping his voice low. \"It's haunted.\"\nThe man's pale, blue eyes grew round. \"I really don't have time for jokes.\"\nPeter glanced at the nameplate on the desk. \"I'm sorry, Mr. MacAfee, but I'm not joking. I paid for a private, unshared universe, and I mean to have it.\"\nMacAfee's face tightened and his mouth squeezed down to a thin line. He held his hand out. \"Your key, please.\"\nPeter handed over the thick card and sat down in the hard-edged chair that was obviously intended to hasten visitors on their way. MacAfee shoved the card into a slot in his desk. With lots of \"uh-hums\" and \"I sees,\" he scanned the information that flickered across his datapad. At last, he looked up. \"As I thought, Mr. Norland. Everything's in order. The Board of Extra-Real Estate does not issue inhabited interstitial properties. Your address is entirely unique.\"\nPeter inched the chair closer and leaned on the front of the desk. MacAfee frowned as Peter's elbow shoved the nameplate off center. \"I didn't say 'inhabited.'\" He was almost whispering. \"I said 'haunted.'\"\nMacAfee blinked several times. He scratched the top of his head, then his nose, then he meticulously folded his hands on the desk in front of him. \"You saw a ghost.\"\n\"It was my wife.\"\n\"Your wife saw a ghost.\"\nPeter sighed. \"My wife has been dead for five years.\"\nPeter stalked out of the E-RE offices and into the crowded streets of midtown Manhattan. The appointment had been a complete waste of time. MacAfee had promised to fill out some forms and file a report, and Peter could expect to hear from a site inspector within two weeks, but the man hadn't believed him. Why should he?\nBut it had been Janelle. He'd seen her clearly in the moonlight. She'd been down by the shore, right there at Battery Park\u2014at least right where Battery Park stood in the real world. In his private world it was a lovely, grass-covered hillock that rolled down to a rocky shore at the southern tip of Manhattan Island.\nThat's where they'd first met, ten years before. He had been just out of college and working in the creative department of a small ad agency. She'd been sitting on the fresh spring grass, strumming a guitar and watching all the tight-suited, tie-strangled Wall Street types whisking back and forth. She'd refused to even say hello until he'd taken off his tie.\nNow she was gone, and he was a junior partner at BBQ&O, and nothing seemed bright or fresh any more. His suits felt too tight. And his ties choked him.\n\"Tell me again,\" said Martin Caine, \"why we had to get a cab across town and fight the rush hour crowds at the IP terminal just to have dinner at your place instead of at Kai Garden?\"\nPeter had more or less inherited his friend. Marty and Janelle had practically grown up together and the two had been a package deal.\n\"I make a mean hamburger,\" Peter said.\nMarty ticked his words off on his fingers, as if proving a point. \"Kai. Garden.\"\n\"I could order us a pizza. Mah-jong's actually delivers to interstitial properties now. Can you believe it?\"\nMarty sighed. He ran a hand across the surface of Peter's dining room table as if smoothing out a wrinkle in the gleaming wood. \"You know you're acting weird, don't you? The Peter Norland I know wouldn't be caught dead eating Mah-jong's Pizza. Have you been replaced with a bad duplicate or something?\"\n\"Is that possible?\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Nothing.\"\nPeter walked over to the sliding glass door. It was open, and a pleasant nighttime breeze brushed past him. \"You know a lot about IP travel, right?\"\n\"I've been out of that business for a long time.\"\n\"But you know about it. I mean you designed the gadgets that make it go.\"\n\"Not really. Just the discriminator circuits that allow for tuning the portals. When I sold out, they were still tying that hideous knot of treaties and agreements. Why?\"\n\"I need to show you something.\"\nPeter dragged his friend out of the house and down the well-worn path toward not-Battery Park. The moon was bright enough to follow the smooth trail and a fierce net of stars stretched overhead.\nMarty stopped, staring up. \"God, I'd forgotten what the Milky Way could look like.\"\n\"Shh.\" Peter tugged Marty's sleeve and whispered. \"This way.\"\n\"Why\u2014?\"\n\"Shh!\"\nMarty finally gave up trying to talk, but his expression showed his annoyance. They walked in silence for fifteen minutes, before Peter pulled him down behind a gravelly berm where sea grasses eased out the other kinds. He held a finger to his lips, then pointed toward the water.\nThere, silhouetted by shards of moonlight that shattered off the water's surface, was Janelle. Peter knew her form. He recognized the delicate arch of the dancer's back, the square set of the rebel's shoulders. She turned slightly, and at the ends of her hair, he could see those little curls she should could never quite control.\nThe moonlight showed Marty's face twisted into a puzzled frown. Carefully, Peter took a small pair of field glasses out of his pocket and handed them to his friend. Marty fiddled with them, focusing and adjusting. Just then, Janelle turned. Her face was struck fully by the moonlight. Marty dropped the field glasses. His eyes were wide. Peter was ready to clamp his hand over his friend's mouth, but it wasn't necessary. Marty was silent as he crept backward, out of sight of the shore. He didn't stand up until he reached the path. Without a word, he headed back to the house, leaving Peter to follow.\nMarty sprinted around the house, turning off the lights. \"Pack a bag and let's go.\"\nPeter followed him. He wanted to turn the lights back on, but the look on Marty's face the first time he tried it dissuaded him. \"It's her, isn't it?\"\n\"Don't be crazy. Janelle's dead. Now let's go.\"\n\"But you knew who I meant, didn't you? If it's not her, why the rush?\"\nMarty stopped and looked at him. \"Well, obviously something's wrong with the addressing scheme, right? So that could be anybody. You don't even have locks on this place. I'm just being prudent.\"\n\"This isn't prudence, it's panic.\"\nA strained smile flashed across Marty's face. \"It's not panic. Look, I still know some people at the E-RE board. We'll get you a different address and they can lock this one out. It's just some kind of screwup.\"\n\"I have a house here, Marty.\"\n\"So you'll build another one. You can afford it.\"\nPeter stood his ground. He peered at his friend, trying to read through the man's expression. \"You know something, don't you?\"\n\"No. Not really. Suspect, maybe.\" He stepped close and grabbed Peter's arm. His grip grew tighter as he spoke. \"Listen to me. There just isn't a can big enough for the number of worms you're reaching for. Janelle died in that fire five years ago. She was a beautiful, sparkling, nova of a person, and we should just be glad we had a chance to know her. This is something else entirely. Just let it go!\"\nPeter kept at him, but Marty wouldn't budge. Either he really didn't know anything more, or Peter would have to resort to torture to get it out of him. Finally, Peter just went along. He threw a couple of suits into a hanging bag, added a random assortment of toiletries, and followed Marty to the return portal that sat about a hundred yards behind the house. They waited in silence as the rumbling underground power system built up the charge necessary to open the portal. Finally, the status light went green.\nPeter punched the \"connect\" button. The familiar silver fog shimmered in the portal's empty frame. He could just make out the frenzied activity of the IP terminal on the other side.\n\"After you,\" Peter said.\nMarty started forward, then stopped and turned. A tiny smile tickled his mouth. \"No, I think\u2014.\"\nPeter shoved him, hard, in the middle of the chest. Marty flew backward through the portal, landing roughly. Peter watched long enough to make sure his friend wasn't hurt, then he shut down the connection. He had the only key in his pocket. If Marty wanted to come back, he'd need a court order.\nOn his way back to the house, Peter tried to decide what to do. If he went back down to the beach, would she still be there? And if she were, what then? Hi, I think you're my dead wife.\n\"Who are you?\"\nPeter froze. He was standing outside the sliding glass door to the dining room. Only his feet were in the pool of light that spilled out. Janelle stood inside. She pointed a pistol at him with one hand. His field glasses dangled from the other.\n\"What is this house doing here?\" she said. \"And who are you?\"\n\"I\u2014. Janelle, listen.\"\n\"How do you know my name?\"\nPeter kept his voice soft. She might not have been a ghost, but he still feared disturbing whatever etheric currents might have swept her to him. \"This is my house,\" he said.\n\"I own this world. And I've got friends on the BRE, so don't try to bluff me.\"\nPeter moved slowly. \"I'm putting my hands up. I don't have any kind of weapon. Now I'm stepping forward.\"\n\"Slowly!\"\n\"I am. It's okay. Just let me get into the light.\"\nTwo more steps. A third. He stepped out of the shadow and Janelle's face flashed through an entire spectrum of emotion. It stopped at fear. The field glasses clunked to the floor and the pistol wavered. \"Who are you? What are you trying to do to me?\"\nHe stepped closer, into the path of her shaking aim. \"It's me, Janelle. I swear. It's Peter.\"\n\"You can't.\" She shook her head wildly. \"You're dead.\"\n\"I what? No, you are. Five years ago.\"\n\"You died in a fire!\"\nPeter nodded. \"The brownstone on East Seventy-second, but I was at the office, working on the Bollinger account.\"\nTears filled Janelle's eyes and the pistol swung down, pointing at the floor. \"You worked from home that night, remember? I had the gallery opening.\"\n\"For your 'Parallel Intersections' exhibit.\" Peter nodded and pointed toward the painting that hung over the fireplace in the living room. \"See? I kept number three. It was your favorite. But you stayed home that night. You had the flu.\"\nJanelle stared at the painting. \"I don't understand.\"\n\"I don't either, but I think it's Marty's can of worms.\"\n\"Marty? He's with the Bureau.\"\nPeter stepped toward her, aching to hold her. He stopped when the gun swung back his way.\nJanelle looked puzzled. She followed his gaze, then stared at the gun in her hand as if she'd never seen it before. \"What? This?\" She laughed, but the sound caught on something sharp in her throat. \"Oh, God, Peter. It's not even loaded.\" The gun fell to the floor as she ran to him.\nPeter held her, crying into her hair. \"Please be real,\" he whispered. \"Please be real.\"\nThey were hesitant, at first, uncertain. The conversation stumbled, but as they talked about the things they'd done together and the places they'd been, the differences seemed less important. Peter didn't care that, for her, their first date had been an Ethiopian restaurant, while, for him, it had been Korean. The two restaurants were just a block away from each other. The important details were the same, the little differences were merely uncomfortable ripples.\nLater, in bed, he found a small, jagged scar on her hip. He knew every inch of her body. It hadn't been there before. \"How did you get this?\"\n\"Power boarding.\"\nHe laughed, tracing the scar with his fingertip. \"When the hell did you take up power boarding?\"\nShe didn't answer right away. The silence stretched and when he looked up at her, she wasn't smiling.\n\"When I was twelve,\" she said.\n\"But\u2014.\"\nShe touched his lips softly. \"Don't say it! You love my scar. You've always loved my scar.\"\nIt took him a moment to realize what she was saying, to understand the bargain. The pasts were the pasts. The differences didn't matter. \"I love your scar.\" He kissed her. \"I've always loved your scar.\"\nThe next day, Janelle went back to her world to grab some clothes and let people know she'd be gone for a few days. By evening, she hadn't returned. At eight o'clock, he started to worry. By ten, he was nearly frantic. He took a flashlight and retraced the route to her return portal. It was a mile up the shore from Battery Park, right where the South Street Seaport was in the real world. He'd never explored that part of his island, that's why he hadn't even known it was there.\nHe sat down to wait, cursing himself for hesitating. He should fly after her. Find her. Make them whole again. But it was another world, one full of differences and uncertainties. He hated doubt, hated not knowing what was around the corner. Janelle was the spontaneous one. She was the firefly to his tortoise. Without her, he just followed the old patterns. What if he couldn't find her? What if he couldn't get back? He lay back and threw his arm across his face. What if? What if?\nHe awoke to the squawk of seagulls. The sun was just clearing the horizon. He looked at the portal, then, briefly, he looked at the rest of his life without Janelle. He took his tie off and threw it aside. He couldn't wait any longer. He fired up the portal and stepped through.\nEven early in the morning, the IP terminal was busy. It was similar to the one Peter was used to. He'd stepped through the silver-gray mist and onto a platform in the middle of a room the size of a large theater. To his right, a long line waited for the outbound gate. Each traveler shoved a stubby little wand into the console, waited as the platform adjusted for small differences in elevation in the destination world, then disappeared through the misty curtain.\n\"Move along.\" The conductor waved him off the landing pad. \"More passengers coming through.\"\nPeter stepped quickly out of the ring of sensors that locked out incoming connections. \"Sorry, I\u2014.\"\nThe man barely glanced at him. \"Move along.\"\nDozens of people in Portal Authority Police uniforms prowled the room. More watched from catwalks suspended twenty feet up. Some of those seemed to be wearing riot gear. So much for the worlds being the same. In Peter's world, PAP officers were little more than night watchmen. He began to wonder if this had been such a good idea, but he was committed now. Without Janelle's key, he couldn't return.\n\"Move like you mean it, buddy.\" A man brushed past him, still grumbling.\nPeter shook himself and fell into step with the people streaming toward the exit. He glanced around the room as he walked, looking for differences, still trying to believe in this other world. Was he acting suspicious? Why had so many police officers suddenly developed a preoccupation with their radios? Blue uniforms converged on the exit, then on his place in line. One officer stepped in front of him, while others formed a breakwater to keep the crowd flowing around them.\nThe policeman blocking his way acted as if everything were just part of his boring routine. \"Sir, will you come with me, please?\"\nPeter stammered. \"What's this about?\"\nThe officer's demeanor shifted. One hand rested on his baton while the other fluttered closer to the gun on his belt. His voice almost sounded eager. \"Are you refusing to comply?\"\n\"Of course not. I just\u2014.\"\n\"Then come with me, please.\"\nPeter had no choice. He followed the officers out of the IP terminal and down a side corridor to a set of Portal Authority offices. He was dumped, without ceremony, into a room called \"Interrogation 2.\"\nWithin minutes, Peter was joined by a tall man whose plaid jacket and striped, stained tie would have looked more at home on a used car lot. His face belonged on a statue. There was no smile, no expression of any kind. His eyes were sharp and bright like cut crystal.\n\"I'm Lieutenant Jeffries and you have some things to explain.\" He sat down and stared at Peter across the scratched steel table.\nWould the truth work? Probably not. It would be best to save it as a last resort. \"I don't understand.\"\nThe Lieutenant was as unemotional as his face. \"Your driver's license is high quality, but an obvious fake. You came through the IP portal, but you're not carrying a key. You came from a property which has no record of you going to it, so you've obviously figured out how to game the system somehow. I need to know how and why.\"\n\"But I didn't.\"\nJeffries stared at him for a moment before continuing. \"The BRE tracks IP transports, Mr. Norland. They recorded one trip to the world in question and two returns. How did you fake the records?\"\nJanelle had mentioned the BRE. It seemed to be something like his own world's Board of Extra-Real Estate. What else had she said? Dammit, think! \"I'm sorry. The BRE?\"\n\"The Bureau of Reality Estate, unless you know of some other agency that should be involved. Homeland Security, perhaps?\"\nThe Bureau! That's what Janelle had said. \"Marty.\"\n\"Your accomplice?\"\n\"Martin Caine is a friend of mine. He's with the Bureau. He can straighten this whole thing out.\"\nJeffries took a slow, deep breath. \"Of course he is. He's the deputy regional director. You could have pulled his name off the news.\"\n\"But we've known each other for years.\"\n\"Sure you\u2014.\"\nThe door swung open and two men in dark suits and flawless gray ties stepped in. They ignored the lieutenant. One flashed an ID at Peter. He barely had time to catch the letters BRE. \"Are you Peter Norland?\"\nJeffries finally showed some emotion. He stood up and planted his white-knuckled fists on the table. \"Just what in hell do you\u2014?\"\nThe BRE agent held out his ID. \"Bureau business, Lieutenant. Mr. Norland is coming with us.\"\n\"On whose authority?\"\n\"D.D. Caine. Northeast region. We'll try to get some paperwork to you in the next week or so.\"\nJeffries, eyes sparkling in the fluorescent light, stared at Peter. Peter just shrugged and followed the agents through the door. They led him outside, where salt spray flavored the air. Cars and buses made a merry-go-round of the long, circular driveway. When they neared the street, the rear door of an enormous, black SUV swung open. Martin Caine stepped out. It wasn't the Martin Caine that Peter knew, though. This one was thinner. His cheeks seemed hollow and there was a kind of tiredness around his eyes, the kind that grew from something deeper than a simple lack of sleep.\nPeter hesitated, unsure of how this Marty would receive him. Peter had, after all, been dead in this world for five years.\n\"Give me your hand,\" Marty said.\nPeter thrust his hand out, as if to shake, but Marty grabbed it and jabbed something sharp into the fleshy part at the base of his thumb.\n\"Ow!\" Peter jerked his hand back. Two tiny spots of blood welled up. \"What the hell?\"\nMarty shoved some kind of cartridge into a bulky hand-held device and stared at the readout. \"There are subtle variations in the ratios of certain isotopes.\"\n\"Sure. Of course.\" Peter sucked on the wound, then tried to shake the sting out of his hand. \"But what the hell?\"\n\"They accumulate in living tissue.\"\n\"Marty, this is really fascinating, but what the hell?\"\nThe unit beeped and Marty seemed satisfied. The ghost of a smile brushed his face. \"It varies from world to world, Peter, and so far, it's unique.\" He waved the two agents away and guided Peter around the terminal building and toward the river. \"Let's walk.\"\nA walkway stretched south along the East River. A gentle breeze swept off the water and the sun rose into one of those rare, crystalline blue New York skies.\n\"Sorry about the test,\" Marty said. \"I had to be sure which world you were from. Or rather weren't from. Yours doesn't appear to be in our database at all.\"\n\"Which world? Jeez, Marty, how many\u2014?\"\n\"There's no way it ever could have worked. We should have known that from the start. It's just too big a can of worms.\"\n\"My Marty said something like that.\"\n\"One of the smart ones.\"\nPeter grabbed Marty's arm and turned him. They were face to face, but Marty's gaze tried to slide away toward the sunlight that danced along the top of the water. Peter shook him. \"Talk to me!\"\n\"It took years to work out the international agreements to split up the spectrum of habitable worlds to avoid address conflicts and overlaps. Technically, the spectrum's infinite, but we can only tune the portals to a certain precision. That limits things.\"\n\"Yes, yes, we had the same problem.\"\nMarty went on as if Peter hadn't spoken. \"No one wanted to talk about the real problem, though\u2014not in public, anyway. There was this whole range of addresses on the J axis that kept haunting us like Pandora's box.\"\nHe went silent while a couple and their two young children walked by. A sad look came over his face as he watched them. \"Infinite worlds means an infinite number of inhabited worlds\u2014and an infinite number that developed IP travel. Imagine the chaos if that became common knowledge. Now imagine trying to hammer out those same agreements across dozens of worlds.\"\n\"Dozens!\"\nMarty shook his head and finally seemed to focus on Peter's face. \"Yesterday, there were sixty-three worlds on the Trans-Real Council. It was inevitable that one of them wouldn't want to play along.\"\n\"Sixty-three?\"\n\"Sixty-two, now.\" Marty rubbed his eyes. He looked more tired than ever. \"We pulled out this morning.\"\n\"I'm sorry, Marty. I don't really understand it, but I'm sorry you're having to deal with whatever it is. But it's a good thing, too, isn't it? I found Janelle again. That's why I'm here. This Janelle, from this world. You have to help me find her.\"\nBut Marty didn't seem to be listening. He was staring south, shading his eyes with one hand.\n\"Oh, God,\" Marty said. \"The bastards are really going to do it!\"\nA flight of cargo planes was coming in low over the Statue of Liberty. Peter counted ten of them. He couldn't judge their size, but they looked enormous.\nMarty tugged on Peter's sleeve and headed back toward the car. \"Come on. We have to get Janelle.\"\n\"You know where she is?\"\n\"Let's go!\"\nWhen they reached the SUV, Peter glanced back at the planes. They were over the city already, skimming just above the tops of the buildings. They filled the sky.\n\"Marty, what the hell is going on?\"\nMarty told the driver to take them to Columbia University. He sat back and covered his face with his hands. \"Those planes are carrying portal generators. That's why they're using cargo planes.\"\n\"But there's no portal. It's not like they can fly through themselves.\"\n\"They don't have to.\" Marty clutched at Peter's shirt. He looked as if he were in agony. \"They mount the portal under the planes. Then they drop bombs through them. The damn things just appear in thin air\u2014in another world.\"\n\"That's insane!\"\n\"Welcome to Trans-World War One.\"\nThey drove into an underground garage deep beneath the Columbia campus. Marty opened the security doors with a keycard, a retinal scan, and some device that seemed to be a larger version of the blood scanner he'd used on Peter. Inside was a large, open space with two tractor trailers sitting in front of an enormous cargo portal. The portal was twice the size of the one they'd used to deliver the building materials for Peter's house.\nMarty whistled and twirled his finger in the air above his head. Immediately, the nearer of the two black trucks started up. A low hum rumbled through the floor and two men in unmarked uniforms sprinted for the back of the trailer. A glowing silver mist began to form in the portal. Marty and Peter got in on the passenger's side of the truck.\n\"Where are we going?\" Peter asked.\nMarty nodded to the driver. \"Whenever you're ready, Agent Manning.\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\nMarty turned to Peter. \"We're going to get Janelle. The idiots that sent those bombers think she's some kind of trans-world spy.\"\n\"Spy!\"\n\"They followed her, Peter. They know you were together. Hell, by now they may even have people in your world.\"\n\"My world? We're not involved in any of this.\"\n\"Are you sure?\"\nThe truck growled and lurched forward. The driver shifted gears and drove straight into the portal's misty curtain. Bright sun momentarily blinded Peter as the truck bounced onto a road of packed dirt. There were no buildings in sight. They drove south through rocky fields. To his left, Peter saw a low, marshy area.\n\"Where are we?\" Peter asked.\nMarty followed Peter's gaze. \"That's Central Park\u2014minus the landscaping.\"\n\"No, I mean this world.\"\n\"It's just an unused IP I keep for my own use.\"\n\"This is where they're keeping Janelle?\"\nMarty shook his head. \"No, but it's on the way.\"\nThey rode on in silence. After a while, they turned more to the east, the driver carefully holding to the dry, stony path. Peter tried to work through everything he'd seen, but the logic kept twisting back around on itself and getting tangled up. Sixty-three worlds? More?\n\"You said they think Janelle's a spy for some other reality.\"\nMarty just nodded.\n\"Then Janelle and I\u2014we caused this war, didn't we?\"\n\"No. Yes.\" Marty shook his head. \"I don't know. Does one snowflake cause an avalanche? This government has been paranoid for years. Even back when the Trans-World Council first formed, they seemed to be spoiling for a fight. They just couldn't come to grips with the idea that their world wasn't the world.\"\n\"It wasn't a problem for you?\"\n\"I believe in fate, Peter.\"\nPeter laughed. \"You're not exactly the spiritual kind. At least my Marty isn't.\"\n\"Neither am I.\" Marty shrugged, shaking his head. \"It's all probabilities. Let's say you take a thousand possible worlds.\"\n\"A thousand!\"\n\"And one event. Say, for example, rain in Seattle this afternoon. If you plot the chances of rain across those realities, you'll get a curve of some kind. Maybe a Bell Curve. Maybe wider, or flatter. But whatever kind of curve you get, that curve is the shape of destiny.\"\nPeter saw what had to be their destination. A tall scaffolding grew in the windshield. Construction trailers were arranged around its base along with a few SUVs like the one Marty had used to pick him up. As they drove up, more uniformed men raced toward the trailer. Marty led Peter toward the skeletal structure while agents dragged cables from the back of the truck. A loud whining growl started up in the trailer.\n\"That's the power supply for the portal,\" Marty said.\n\"What portal?\"\nMarty led him into a cage-like elevator, shut the door, and slapped the control to \"up.\" \"You're in midtown. The detention cells are on the twelfth floor of a BRE building there.\"\n\"We're going back to you world?\"\n\"It's kind of a shortcut.\"\n\"But\u2014.\"\n\"You think this is bad? Wait until someone comes up with a power supply that isn't the size of a semi. All hell will break loose.\"\nTwelve stories up, the floor plan was carefully marked off with tape on the plywood floor. Three agents in full riot gear stood at the ready. The plan was simple. They would pop into the detention area, on the other side of the security station, then they would grab Janelle and either bluff or fight their way out.\n\"Fight?\" Peter stared at the handgun Marty had just given him. \"I thought you were Deputy Director. Can't you just use the front door?\"\nMarty looked at his shoes. \"Yeah, I guess I should have mentioned that.\"\n\"Marty?\"\n\"We kind of have this civil war going on inside the Bureau. I have my agents, they have theirs, and the rest don't even know what's going on.\"\n\"So you're not Deputy Director?\"\n\"I was as of a couple of hours ago.\" Marty shrugged. \"It's complicated. The fighting's all been bureaucratic, so far, but with the war starting, who knows?\"\nThree agents in riot gear formed up behind them. The portal, set in the middle of the tape-line hallway, began to fog up.\n\"Why, Marty?\" Peter shoved the gun into his belt and put on a BRE jacket that one of the agents handed him. \"You're risking everything to help us.\"\n\"Being friends isn't enough?\"\n\"Your friend died five years ago.\"\n\"And yet, here you are.\" Marty's smile faded and he stared at the portal's mist. \"There's something special about you two. Always has been. Janelle says you're destined to be together. I believe her.\"\n\"You're trying to fulfill destiny?\"\nMarty stepped forward until he was just inches from the portal. \"That's the thing about destiny. You don't have to try.\"\nThe hallway was empty. Doors on each side marked the individual holding rooms. Two agents sprayed black paint on the security cameras. They nodded to Marty and he used a key card to open the room marked \"17.\"\n\"You son of a bitch!\" Janelle's voice exploded out of the room. \"Why, Marty? Why did you have me arrested? I thought we were friends.\"\nMarty stood in the doorway. \"It wasn't me. I'm here to get you out.\"\n\"I don't believe you! I tell you about Peter and an hour later your thugs pick me up? You're the only one I told, Marty. Who else\u2014?\"\nPeter pushed past his friend and into the room. \"It's true, Janelle. We're here to get you out.\"\nShe stared at him. Doubt and confusion showed on her face. \"Peter. Are you\u2014? How do I know?\"\n\"I love your scar,\" he said. \"I've always loved your scar.\"\nJanelle leaped forward and threw her arms around his neck.\n\"We have to go,\" Marty said.\nThey marched down the corridor and around the corner. Marty and one of the agents led the way, followed by Peter and Janelle. The other two agents brought up the rear. Eventually, they came to the security station. A large steel door barred the way. A single agent kept watch from a small desk on the left. On the right was a glassed-in office filled with monitors. Another agent glanced up as they approached the door.\n\"Open up,\" Marty said to the agent behind the desk.\nThe agent looked confused, but snapped straight when he recognized Marty. \"Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. I didn't know you were on site.\n\"Hold it.\" The other agent came out of the office. His handgun was pointed in Marty's direction, but not quite at him. \"D.D. Caine, I have orders to hold you on suspicion of treason.\"\n\"That's ridiculous.\" Marty folded his arms across his chest and the guard's aim became more certain. \"You have no authority to\u2014.\"\nBang! The gunshot blasted over Peter's shoulder. The agent that had challenged them crashed into the corner and didn't move. The door guard stared at Marty, eyes wide.\nMarty's voice seemed all the more threatening for being almost a whisper. \"Open the door.\"\n\"Yes, sir.\" He fumbled with his keys, but got the door open. Then he jumped aside and flattened himself against the wall.\nMarty led them down the hallway to the stairwell. The first agent led the way, and Marty followed. Peter paused to let Janelle go first. He was about to follow when a small, black can popped into existence a dozen feet away and clattered to the floor.\n\"Flashbang!\" Someone shoved Peter through the door. A deafening explosion and a blinding flash came from behind him. His ears rang and everything sounded hollow. Marty and the lead agent pounded down the stairs with Janelle in tow. Peter followed with just one agent behind him. At the next landing, the rear guard stopped and aimed his weapon back up the stairs. Peter couldn't hear him, but he understood the gestures: Follow the others.\nPeter raced on. Gunfire cracked like thunder. The sound shot off the walls of the stairwell, seeming to come from everywhere at once. Dull, staccato footsteps were barely audible above the pounding of his own heart. He caught up with the others and the four of them burst through the heavy fire door into the lobby.\nThe slick expanse of gray-veined marble was empty. Then it wasn't. In pairs, BRE agents began appearing in the middle of the lobby. Marty and his agent sent a wild burst of fire in their direction. The attackers dropped for cover. New arrivals tumbled over them, piling up and scattering their return fire.\nMarty led his group past the elevators at a dead run. More gunshots thundered behind them. Marble cracked near Peter's face, chips flying. Marty stumbled and dropped to his knees, but the agent scooped him up with a hand under his arm. They turned right down a hallway and ten yards later, zigged left. Heavy doors blocked their way. Marty jammed a keycard into the slot and the door opened with a deep, metallic clank.\nFootsteps echoed down the hallway behind them. Peter ran through the doorway behind Janelle and found himself staring at four more agents, nasty-looking rifles at the ready.\n\"Get down!\"\nHe grabbed Janelle and dove to the side. Automatic fire crackled over his head, sounding like hell's own popcorn maker. The door slammed and one of the new agents jumped over Peter to secure it.\nPeter brushed Janelle's hair back and lifted her face toward him. They were still lying on the cold concrete floor. Tears streamed down her face. \"Are you okay?\" he asked.\nShe nodded, sobbing.\nHe kissed her forehead. \"I hate your world, you know.\"\nShe was still crying, but her mouth hinted at a smile. \"Too dull for you?\"\nThe room was a portal room. The frame, large enough for three people to walk through side by side, was already fogging up. They found Marty seated at a control console against the wall. He was hunched over the controls.\n\"Marty?\" Peter squatted next to him and touched his arm. His friend's jacket fell aside, showing a dark stain spreading across his shirt from his left side.\n\"Getting you out,\" Marty said.\n\"Is there a doctor there?\"\n\"Not me.\" Marty grimaced and his whole body shivered, as if he were freezing. \"My world, my mess.\"\nJanelle kneeled next to him. \"Come with us. You can always come back once your better.\"\nMarty smiled. He touched her hair, her cheek. \"Don't worry. I'll always be with you.\"\nJanelle smiled, but to Peter, it looked forced. \"You're an atheist Marty. Dead is dead, remember?\"\nMarty coughed and Peter noticed a speck of reddish foam at the corner of his mouth. \"Not God,\" he said. \"Math. The calculus of destiny.\"\nAn agent came and led Peter and Janelle away. \"Don't worry,\" he said. \"Once you're clear, we'll portal out and get him back uptown.\"\n\"He won't make the trip,\" Peter said.\n\"He'll be okay.\"\n\"What about us? Where are we going?\"\n\"Mr. Caine didn't say. Just somewhere safe.\"\nThey stood before the portal and Peter put his hand out to the agent. \"You risked a lot. Thank you.\"\nThe man took his hand, then shrugged. \"Mr. Caine says it's the way things are supposed to be.\"\n\"And you believe him?\"\n\"It's the way things are.\" The agent shrugged again and shook his head slightly. \"I'm not sure it matters how they're supposed to be.\"\nPeter and Janelle stepped into a room that was nearly identical to the one they'd just left. This one, though, was devoid of the armed and armored BRE agents. Instead, four men in business suits stood as if they'd been expecting them. Martin Caine stepped forward, grinning.\n\"Marty!\" Peter headed toward him.\nJanelle grabbed his sleeve. \"And Marty.\"\nNow Peter noticed that all four men were variations on a theme of Martin Caine. His steps faltered and vertigo threatened his footing. He stepped in front of Janelle and reached back protectively.\n\"I know,\" the lead Marty said. \"It's a lot to take in. It's just . . . .\"\nAnother Marty stepped forward and put his hand on the first one's shoulder. \"He's new here, Peter. He hasn't seen you since\u2014well, since you died.\"\n\"Peter!\" Janelle\u2014a new Janelle\u2014ran toward him from the back of the room. This one had short hair, dyed with a faint purple streak on one side, but she was unmistakably Janelle.\nHis Janelle stepped around him and planted herself between him and the other one.\nThe new Janelle stopped. Her hands moved aimlessly. \"Peter?\"\nOne of the Marties spoke up. His voice was soft. \"Janelle, I told you it would be hard.\"\nTears filled purple Janelle's eyes. She sank to her knees. \"Peter.\"\nPeter put his hands on his Janelle's shoulders and turned her to face him. \"I can't let her suffer like that. I can't let you suffer.\"\nHer expression was hard, but confused. \"She's not me!\"\n\"No, she's not. Any more than you're the Janelle I knew or I'm the Peter you knew.\"\n\"I lost you, too, you know.\"\nPeter nodded, slowly. \"And if Marty's right, then we've found each other, loved each other, and lost each other a million times.\"\nShe looked away. Her gaze settled on the new Janelle. \"Is that how it works, then? We're all interchangeable? I'm her, she's me, and we're both the someone you lost five years ago?\"\n\"I don't know. I'm just winging it. For the first time in my life I have no idea what the right thing is. I don't know the rules.\"\nPurple Janelle was still on her knees. Her hands covered her face and she was rocking forward and back, crying.\n\"Go,\" Janelle said, her voice soft. \"She needs you.\"\nPeter took her hand. \"She needs us.\"\nPeter stood atop a small hill that overlooked the busy camp. A warm, dry wind carried the smell of turned earth and ripening crops. He watched as Martin Caine climbed steadily toward him. This world was warmer than the one Peter knew, and violent storms tortured the coast during the fall season, but it was outside the normal range of addresses, and that gave hope that it would remain private for a while.\nMarty reached the top of the hill and unconsciously flashed the tag on his shirt that read \"j37z12\". It was the Marty from Peter's own world. With eighty-three versions of Peter and Janelle living in camp, and half that many Marties passing through at any given time, it just made sense to wear tags designating their addresses of origin. It cut down, at least a little, on the confusion.\n\"I just wanted to stop by before I portaled home,\" Marty said.\n\"You just missed Janelle.\" Peter tossed his head toward the camp. \"She's got weed-pulling duty in the vegetable garden.\"\n\"I kind of wanted to talk to you alone first.\"\nPeter knew Marty's style. Bad news always came with a quiet overture. \"What now?\"\n\"The war's over.\" Marty shoved his hands deep into his pockets and stared down at the grass. \"It wasn't pretty. Eighty-three worlds in the new Trans-World Union and I think they all attacked at once. Her New York is gone.\"\n\"And Marty?\"\n\"What?\"\n\"No, I mean what about her Marty? He was good to us.\"\nThis Marty didn't look up. He just shook his head.\nPeter looked around. He scanned the peaceful little camp that was quickly becoming a village. Before long, it would be a town. \"When I first met him, he called it Trans-World War One.\"\n\"I know.\"\n\"'One', Marty. Like he was expecting a two and a three.\"\nMarty finally looked up at Peter's face. \"Everything that can be, is. Including you and Janelle.\"\n\"Why us?\"\n\"Damned if I know, but you two seem to be the eye of the storm. Somehow, you're the nexus around which all of this swirls. If that's not destiny, I don't know what is.\"\nPeter took a step forward and put his hand on Marty's shoulder. \"Then stay. If this is safety, stay here with us.\"\nMarty just shook his head. \"You have your destiny and we Martin Caines have ours.\" He reached up and squeezed Peter's hand, then pulled it off his shoulder, smiling. \"Besides, we've made contact with a new one. It seems a friend of his is whining about his world being haunted.\"\nJason K. Chapman lives in New York City where he works as the IT Administrator for Poets & Writers.

They point at him, as if accusing him of some dark tragedy. He winces.\n\u201cI see,\u201d he says flatly, not so much to her as to the sky.\nOff in the distance, by the now sleepy shore, the remnants of London stretch, charred, broken, in ruin, yet still used. He can just make out the thin smoke columns of fires, burning steady against the rising evening wind.\nHe sucks it in, the wind, lets it caress his face this one last time before he must give it all up to the Dhijad, the wind, water, the asphalt jungle he calls home. He curses his artificial eyes for the clarity of memories.\n\u201cI suppose the order comes effective immediately,\u201d he says, going through the motions, knowing the answer.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Karyn replies. \u201cNavy transports are gearing up for the evacuation.\u201d She walks over and places her hands on his shoulders. \u201cThere is no other choice, Jon.

Shadows and silhouettes of ruins scatter the view of the shore. Moonlight casts doubtful shadows, blankets rustle. Enhance.\nThe memory of London is haunted for him, and there is something, something he can\u2019t explain that laments the city\u2019s broken back, voices echoing into the night where only the spirits of the dead now wander. He can feel it in his heart and in his bones, a swirling band of sadness and peace, as elusive as the evening mist, yet as perceptible as a fever.\nFires twinkle in the city, while the stars shine hard and silent like sentinels in the sky. From inside a burnt out block of flats he can hear the water licking at the shore, the thrum of a vehicle down a dark and narrow street. The air seems pensive. How long now? How long would it be before they come? This time he tries not to remember...\nKaryn shovels a fork full of food into her mouth from a plate near their makeshift bed. The candles are still burning and wiggling in the moving air, casting an eerie glow and producing quick shapes his eyes could hardly record properly.\nHe can hear them, his eyes, the tiny machinery whining and clicking in his sockets.\nKaryn lies flat on her stomach, her legs entwined in his, the plate on the floor. \u201cThe last time I will see these stars with you,\u201d she says, eyes fixed up, her back to him. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll meet down in Kent...\u201d\nHe smiles inwardly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take the boat out tonight onto the Thames? You and me under these stars?\u201d He\u2019d always secretly wanted to, that night, to let it all slip away, fall behind him as if he\u2019d never been a part of it.

She sits up, and he sees the smooth skin of her back, reaches out and touches it.\n\u201cKaryn...\u201d he breaks off.\nShe turns to him, soft eyes betraying concern. \u201cWhy do you do this to yourself?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says, wanting to pull the eyes out of his head; the eyes they had given him. But his brain remembers as well as his eyes. \u201cI guess I expect to rewrite it all. Or to push delete and wipe it all away.\u201d\n\u201cEverything must play itself out,\u201d she says. \u201cJust as it should.\u201d\n\u201cShould it?\u201d\nShe smiles somewhat wickedly. \u201cJust for you, Jon.\u201d\nHer face resumes the composure it had before the shift in conversation, the way it had been that night. She gets up, the blankets rustle down, exposing her flesh to the moonlight, cold and pale and ghostly. She walks to the window.

But he can never keep them shut for long.\nScene interrupt. Scroll image 333-443320-12c. Replay.\nHe hears the boats rocking in the docks, the soft groaning of the hulls in his ears. He opens his eyes. The water glows silver in the pale light of the moon in a remarkably crystal sky. He sees her form on the quay, silhouetted and haloed in a ghostly moonlit aura.\nAnd he can feel them out there, hidden behind the velvet of dark, ready to come bursting forth from the quantum bubble and set fire to the night. He shivers.\nHe had been there, in Birmingham, when they had come, set fire to it, let it burn. And he had seen Manchester reduced to ash and steam from a distance as those clan ships hurtled away from the bloody massacre.\nHe squeezes his eyes shut and shakes his head. (Scene interrupt...) He opens them, wet, glossy, tired. So very tired. (Scene continue...)\nHe suddenly grows cold, shivering. \u201cKaryn,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to hear you say it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve got us a place on a navy frigate.

The moment is fading.\n\u201cIt would be nice,\u201d she says, her smile distant in the moonlight. \u201cTo finally stay somewhere together for longer than a few weeks. You. Me.\u201d\n\u201cI need you to say it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a little secret,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cWant to hear it?\u201d\n\u201cOh God, please say it!\u201d\n\u201cBefore the internet when down, I spied out a little place by the shore for us,\u201d she says. There is a crashing in his brain. \u201cJust for us. You like the sea, the boats.\u201d She reaches out for him to join her for a walk on the quayside, like she had done that night before they had come, unannounced.\nBut he was supposed to help stop it all. Wasn\u2019t he? That\u2019s what they used him for, right? And these islands were to be spared by capitulation. Spared. Left untouched.\nThe knowledge of his actions came to him the day the Dhijad knocked out those new defences, defences known to them through his eyes...\n\u201cSay you forgive me,\u201d he whispers to the air.\n\u201cA little place for us,\u201d she continues.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he relents, chest caved in. \u201cSounds real nice.\u201d\n\u201cMy gift to you, Jon.\u201d\nHe quivers slightly and remains where he is, takes a long, deep breath and awaits the inevitable, the lightning crashing to earth. Again.\n\u201cGoodbye, Karyn,\u201d he says.\nShe doesn\u2019t hear. She watches the stars.\nBut he swears, swears that this time as she looks back, hand still outstretched, before the night becomes day and the water in the Thames boils and the little shanty towns built upon the ruins blows away in the fire wind, that she is smiling at him. Smiling.\nAnd he waits for the scene to fade, for the vision to smudge and swirl into base colours and finally turn black.\nThrough the replay he can hear shuffling sounds behind that steel door...\nAnd he waits, longingly, in the dim light for that promised peace that seems to never come, that final resting peace where at long last he can relinquish countless hours of replay.\nPeace.\nThe peace of the dead.\nCarmelo Rafala's stories have seen publication in British publications such as Jupiter magazine, Forgotten Worlds, Neon Literary Journal, as well as the anthology The West Pier Gazette and Other Stories, edited by former Interzone production editor Paul Brazier (due out in hardback this Christmas).

Lyon\nDear Ms. Traveler,\nThe editors of Nature present their compliments and beg you to forgive this small intrusion. As a result of the German bombing of London during WWII, we have no records of our subscribers prior to 1927, but our surviving records do show that you have been a subscriber to this journal ever since 1927. No other individual subscription has continued for so great a period of time. We are gratified that our journal has sustained your interest for so long and we thank you.\nMay we ask if you are the original subscriber or if, perhaps, the subscription was originally taken out in the name of your mother or grandmother, and you continued it in her name? Whatever the explanation, it has been our honor to have had a subscription of such great duration.\nIn this honor we are, however, not completely alone. According to the Guinness Book of World Records the longest magazine subscription is Mrs. Cavendish's subscription to the American magazine Science, which, beginning in 1923, continues to this day. For this reason we should very much like to know if your subscription to Nature began prior to 1923. As you may imagine, we should enjoy beating Science in this matter.\nVery Truly Yours,\nAdicus Ryan Garton, Senior Editor, Nature\nDear Mr. Garton,\nI thank you for your compliments, for it has been long and long since anyone spoke to this old lady so graciously. My subscription to your fine magazine began on Nov. 4, 1869 with the first issue but, sadly, I am not sure I can claim the honor of having the longest individual subscription. The circumstances of my subscription are a bit awkward and blur the distinction between institutional and individual subscriptions. Before I can explain, you need to sign the enclosed confidentiality agreement and mail it back to me.\nSince this is a somewhat unusual request I will explain as much as I may. Whether my subscription should be considered individual or institutional depends on the answer to Fermi's famous question. As you know, our sun is a star of a very common type in a galaxy of a hundred billion stars. Stars have planets the way cats have kittens. On Earth life appeared and began evolving as soon as conditions permitted. Thus, spread through the galaxy, there should be millions or even billions of worlds that hold living creatures. Earth is 4 billion years old and has sheltered life for nearly all of that time. If this is typical, then many worlds are billions of years from producing intelligent life and others did so billions of years ago. The appearance, then, is that we live in a galaxy that is home to many vastly advanced races, beings capable of doing anything that is not scientifically impossible.\nThus Fermi's question, since interstellar travel is difficult but not impossible, where is everybody? Why is there no evidence that aliens have ever visited Earth?\nThe answer to this question is in a sealed envelop which I enclose. In ordinary business practice I would mail you this envelop only after receiving the signed agreement, but my situation is far from ordinary and such precautions unnecessary. Pray believe me: if you open this envelop without mailing the agreement, it will cause much unnecessary confusion.\nSincerely\nMiss S. Traveler\nP. S. I'll give you a hint as to the answer to Fermi's question. There's a common misconception that the Theory of Relativity forbids faster-than-light travel because ftl travel could involve reverse causality. Actually, there are many examples in physics of things which travel faster than light. They don't violate Relativity because their natures are such that they cannot be used for effective communication, hence no reverse causality.\nDear Mr. Garton,\nI ask you to use your imagination. Engineers delight in turning the limitations which prevent them from doing one thing into the means by which they do another. The impossibility of effective ftl communication is often referred to as Cosmic Censorship because it is an absolute barrier to knowledge. Suppose the engineers of an alien civilization used Cosmic Censorship as the basis for a stealth technology. This would involve separating communication and travel, becoming non-observable by traveling faster than light.\nThe incentives for such a development are great. It would allow them to roam the galaxy, seeing its wonders, visiting other civilization, both those who might prove friendly and those who would be dangerous if they could see us.\nOf course, when one goes home from such a trip, one's memories of the trip are subject to Cosmic Censorship, i.e. one has to wait a speed of light time lag for them to catch up. Ditto souvenirs from the trip. While that's a bit inconvenient, if one lives near the center of the galaxy, there are a great many very interesting places only a few light months away. One can recall one's last vacation well before time to book another.\nThere's also the advantage that, if one has a fatal accident while traveling, one can be taken to a remote planet such as Earth and live a long and full life there, never knowing that anything unfortunate happened.\nWhile there's no way I can be sure about it, I believe that's what happened to me. I arrived on your planet in 1808, and have spent my time since then running a boarding house for aliens. Since my guests are often as unobservable to me as they would be to you, collecting my rents is a rather complicated and difficult process. Since only effective communications are impossible, we have to keep any contact between us below the noise level and thus ineffective. For the most part this means that I talk to my solicitor, who talks to their solicitors, who talks to them. Since the whole chain of communication is subject attorney\/client privilege, the noise level is high. Of course, every once in a while, someone makes a mistake, does something that would be an effective communication. Since that can't happen, well, remember that ftl communication is impossible because it involves reverse casualty just like time travel. When an effective ftl communication happens, it triggers reverse causality so that it didn't happen. The timeline shifts at its weakest point, making the circumstances around the communication such that it becomes ineffective. The changes that result can be very confusing and complicated.\nAnyway, as far as I know, I am the only individual who reads my copy of Nature, but my invisible boarders might also be reading it. Wouldn't that make it an institutional subscription?\nBest Regards\nMiss Stella Traveler\nP. S. You did sign the confidentiality agreement, didn't you? Without it, something would certainly have happened to prevent this letter from being an effective communication. It's had to guess what reverse causality might do. Why, in an extreme case, you could find yourself no longer being the editor of Nature in London, England, but instead the editor of some weird American magazine.\nRichard K. Lyon is a semi-retired research scientist\/inventor whose hobbies include collecting pulp SF magazines and writing. In collaborating with Andy Offutt, he did the Tiana trilogy (DEMON IN THE MIRROR, THE EYES OF SARSIS, and WEB OF THE SPIDER) and RAILS ACROSS THE GALAXY for Analog. He has also published numerous short stories and novelettes. A collection of the latter, TALES FROM THE LYONHEART is available from Barnes and Noble, etc.\n|\n|\n______\n|\n||\n|\n______","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}

He shifted in his chair and lit a cigar, letting the gray smoke whirl around him before speaking again. \u201cBut I\u2019m willing to pay the going rate; 500 denima.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m taking a big risk just talking to you. With all the poachers and thrill killers the Plutisian government\u2019s really cracking down. I think it\u2019ll cost more.\u201d\nSantiago eyed him up and down. Jonathan was a stalky man with a serious expression always drawn on his face. But his eyes were rational; no hint of the denima fever that most guides got around a wealthy offworlder. \u201c1500,\u201d Santiago said. \u201cTake it or leave it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Santiago said as he rose. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in the morning.\u201d He began to walk out of the small cluttered hut but stopped by the doorway and turned back. \u201cWhen is morning around this damned place anyway?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be two earth hours until nightfall and then eight hours of darkness. We\u2019ll have ten hours of daylight for the hunt as well.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s more than enough\u2014see you then.\u201d\nAs Santiago left, Jonathan walked to the door and stared out into the forest. 1500 denima was enough to pay back what he lost at the Beccani tables. He\u2019d be even with the owners of the gambling den, who were mostly bureaucrats for the government on top of business owners, and could go about like a normal business person instead of having to resort to clandestine meetings in a shabby hut on the outskirts of town.\nJonathan got a bottle of old rum down from a cupboard and poured himself a glass before stepping outside. The forest was a cacophony of the sounds of life. High pitched chirps, rhythmic hoots \u2026 and the occasional roar. The roars were far off in the distance though, most of the larger carnivorous species liked to stay around the middle of the forest away from civilization.\nThe rum tasted like stale bread; he hadn\u2019t had a good drink since leaving earth more than five years ago. Then again, who knew? Maybe this stuff was better? He\u2019d heard people who\u2019d never been to earth saying they couldn\u2019t stand alcohol from there; tasted too bland, they said. Like it was made to be drunk in quantity rather than savored. Still, he missed it. You always miss what you\u2019re used to.\nNightfall would come soon enough and Jonathan walked inside and locked the door behind him. He lay down on his bed and stared at the ceiling, listening to the sounds of the forest. Sometimes, when the animals calmed down, he could hear a waterfall in the distance.\nThe next day came with a bang rather than a whimper. A loud explosion shocked Jonathan out of bed. He stood up, groggy, and stumbled to the door. Santiago stood outside testing his rifle, an old model that shot hunks of iron out of the barrel at high velocities.\n\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d Jonathan asked.\n\u201cSmith and Wesson 30\/30. Big game rifle. Antique I picked up in the Canendor system.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s too loud.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll attract the wrong kind of attention.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what attention is that?\u201d\nJonathan took a deep breath and stepped out. He walked to Santiago and took the rifle from his hands, examining it. \u201cYou don\u2019t know the first thing about hunting on this planet, do you?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you speak to me that way; I\u2019m the customer. You\u2019re providing a service.\u201d\n\u201cLook, there\u2019s a species on this planet called an efferusaur. It responds to sound.\u201d\n\u201cEfferusaur,\u201d Santiago said with a grin. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of them. I think I\u2019d like to hunt that today.\u201d\nJonathan shook his head in disbelief. He hated hunters who came here without any conception of what they were doing; they were a liability. \u201cYou can\u2019t hunt an efferusaur.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cTrust me, you don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I do. And if you want to keep your fee I suggest you help me.\u201d\nJonathan mulled it over a moment and then said, \u201cForget it, find someone else. They\u2019re too dangerous.\u201d\nAs he started to walk away, Santiago yelled, \u201c2500 denima.\u201d\nJonathan stopped but didn\u2019t look back. It was enough to pay his debts and buy him a ticket off this planet. Not enough to get passage back to earth, but enough to get closer than he was now. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t kill one with that thing.\u201d\nHe walked into the hut and came back out with a Class A ion rifle. Technically, it was banned on this planet but so was hunting an efferusaur. \u201cUse this,\u201d he said, handing it to Santiago.\nSantiago considered the weapon. It was smooth, but not metal; some sort of hard fibrous material. Though it appeared large, it weighed less than his other rifle. He grinned. \u201cThis will do fine.\u201d\nJonathan nodded and turned to gather his things.\nThe rover traversed the forest landscape as if it were traveling on oiled metal; hardly any bumps or jerky movements inside the cabin. This was due to the fact that the rover rested above ground on a ferrofluid force field\u2014an ionized column of air interacting with a magnetic fluid\u2014essentially, a giant magnetic bubble that the vehicle could lay on. Jonathan sat in the backseat while Santiago and his wife sat up front.\nHis wife was something of an enigma. He hadn\u2019t introduced her and not once had he mentioned her beforehand, but there she was. Slim and with dark red hair, she was attractive for a woman her age, but distant. Not really present in the moment she was in.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been sailing for hours,\u201d Santiago said, \u201cand all I\u2019ve seen is a herd of decapods and some mansueti.\u201d\n\u201cStop here,\u201d Jonathan said, \u201cwe\u2019re close enough.\u201d\nThey stopped in a large grassy clearing. In the distance was Mount Flynn, named after the first explorer to climb to its snow covered peak. Above that, taking up the view of most of the sky, was Juno, a nearby planet with no inhabitants. It was over ninety percent water and appeared like a sparkling blue gem in the sky.\nThe air smelled of wild grass and the warmth of daylight was comforting. But the serenity of this moment came at a price; they were in one of the most dangerous spots on Plutus\u2014in the center of a forest filled with herbivores. Wherever there were groups of herbivores, there were carnivores. And none came as ferocious as an efferusaur.\n\u201cHand me your rifle,\u201d Jonathan said. \u201cThe antique.\u201d\nJonathan pointed the weapon up in the air and fired, the loud crackle scattering flocks of winged rodents and insects. He fired again, and again, then waited. \u201cAre you sure that will attract one?\u201d Santiago asked.\nJonathan didn\u2019t respond. He was busy focusing on the tremors in the ground and a nearby rustling of trees. Something was approaching. \u201cGet out of the rover,\u201d he said.\nSantiago jumped out, nearly falling flat on his face. Adrenaline was coursing through him, and it flushed his face red and quickened his breath. He aimed the ion rifle in front of him. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d\nJonathan pointed to a cluster of trees on the edge of the clearing. \u201cHe\u2019s coming from there,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAim for the chest or head, anywhere else will just anger him.\u201d\n\u201cYou sure this gun\u2019s powerful enough?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Jonathan lied. In truth, the ion was a laser diode gun. It operated at a wavelength that caused the oxygen rich atmosphere around it to change into a plasma state. Using a laser induced plasma channel, an electric current is shot down the ionized plasma and out the barrel. It was the most powerful rifle available, but a particularly thick hide or too great a distance could negate its effects.\nJonathan hopped into the driver\u2019s seat of the rover, glancing at Santiago\u2019s wife. She was applying makeup to her face and watching a holovid on a small monitor in the dashboard.\n\u201cHe\u2019s quite the fool, isn\u2019t he?\u201d she said, turning to him and smiling. \u201cI\u2019m Victoria.\u201d\n\u201cJonathan, nice to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cLikewise.\u201d\nJonathan pulled a lever that opened the harpoon gun on the bow of the rover. He scanned the edge of the clearing; there was still some rustling here and there, but nothing concrete. \u201cHow long you guys been together?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not talk about him right now,\u201d Victoria said, leaning back in her chair.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem so bad.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s an oaf. I only married him because my parents forced me; he\u2019s wealthy, they\u2019re wealthy \u2026 they thought social etiquette demanded it.\u201d She glanced at him. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what you can get used to.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019d you mean?\u201d\n\u201cHe \u2026 he beats me sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cFor his pleasure.\u201d She chuckled softly. \u201cHe told me on our wedding night of all times that he\u2019ll have to hit me sometimes, not because he hates me but because it\u2019s arousing for him.\u201d She looked off into the jungle for a moment and then back to Jonathan. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat about me?\u201d\n\u201cNo mate in your life?\u201d\nJonathan shook his head. \u201cNot with the kind of life I lead.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what kind of life is that?\u201d\nHe looked at her. She was wearing a tight beige uniform that exposed the soft, silky flesh of her legs. \u201cAn unstable one.\u201d\nSuddenly a thunderous roar tore through the air and whipped their heads around. It was followed by the crunching of tree branches and a bassed, rhythmic pounding\u2014footsteps on the soft forest floor.\nAt first all they saw was a mass pushing aside the canopy of vegetation. Then, the mass took shape. A triangular head covered with gray flesh, a solid muscular body and two massive hind legs. The efferusaur\u2019s lip quivered as it stared at its peculiar prey, its red eyes glinting in the daylight. It opened its gargantuan mouth, revealing row after row of serrated teeth, and let out a deafening roar that caused the rover to tremble with its pitch.\n\u201cGood god!\u201d Santiago shouted as he lowered his rifle and stepped back.\n\u201cHold your ground,\u201d Jonathan said. \u201cAim for the head or chest.\u201d\nThe efferusaur stepped into the clearing, showing its truth girth. It was at least 20 meters in height and thick as a building. Another roar boomed in the air around them. The efferusaur lowered its head, exhaling loudly through its nostrils. It was sizing up its enemy.\n\u201cShoot now,\u201d Jonathan said. There was no reply. \u201cDamn it Santiago, shoot!\u201d\nSantiago, icy fear gripping his stomach and not letting go, didn\u2019t hear Jonathan. He just stared at the beast, reverting back to some primeval state of his species. A time when there were only two responses to every problem.\nThe ground shook as the efferusaur charged. Thick strands of drool sopped from its mouth as it roared in anticipation.\n\u201cShoot!\u201d Jonathan screamed.\nSantiago was frozen. A warm stream of urine dripped down his leg as he dropped the rifle and ran.\nVictoria screamed and tried to climb into the backseat as Jonathan jumped out of the rover. He picked up the ion rifle and flipped it on, aiming at the creature\u2019s chest. The efferusaur was almost on them now, a low growl escaping its mouth as it opened to bite down on its prey.\nThe creature gained speed as it closed in on Jonathan. He felt the coolness of being in its shadow before he heard the small beep of the rifle, indicating it was fully charged.\nHe pulled the trigger, and there was silence.\nThe discharge of the rifle caused his ears to ring and he couldn\u2019t hear anything. He jumped back, gripping the side of the rover as he saw the efferusaur above him, his shadow growing larger.\nAs he went to aim the rifle again, the shadow began to recede. The beast had been shot with a direct hit in the chest. It\u2019d caused a sever burn but not gotten through his breastplate to the heart. The efferusaur, wounded and in pain, turned to run.\nJonathan, still deafened from the rifle, jumped into the rover and used a maneuvering pad to aim the harpoon. He had a target right into the creature\u2019s back, and he grabbed the seat to steady himself and hit the release.\nThe harpoon exploded out of the vessel, the recoil knocking the hover back. Jonathan felt the muscles in his arms strain to keep him where he was; it was all he could do not to go through the windshield.\nWhen he\u2019d steadied himself, he saw the large glimmering steel sticking out of the dinosaur\u2019s back. It was a direct shot.\nWhen the efferusaur had disappeared into the forest, the thick strand of fiberwire connected to the harpoon following it, Jonathan turned to Victoria who was huddled on the floor.\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d he said.\n\u201cIs it gone?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone. Are you hurt?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, climbing up.\nShe was trembling, and Jonathan felt a twinge of pity for her. He took her arm and helped her up into the passenger seat.\n\u201cStay here,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll go find Santiago.\u201d\nAs he hopped out, Jonathan noticed that his own hands were trembling. He could feel sweat rolling down his back, and his heart felt like it was about to tear away from his chest. That was too close. Closer than he\u2019d ever been before.\nHe walked over the grass awhile until he could see a dim shape walking out of the forest; it was Santiago.\n\u201cYou all right?\u201d Jonathan asked.\n\u201cFine,\u201d he said, trying to hide his embarrassment. \u201cJust took me by surprise is all.\u201d\nJonathan nodded. \u201cIt happens. Come on, I hit it with the harpoon.\u201d\n\u201cNow what?\u201d\n\u201cNow we track it. It\u2019s injured, it\u2019ll either die soon or lay down to rest. If it rests, we hit it again.\u201d\nThe rover sailed through the twisting forest after the beast, adeptly using its automatic monitoring to weave in and out of thick bundles of trees and shrubs. The three passengers rode in silence, Victoria not having spoken to Santiago since he returned. Jonathan felt somewhat sorry for him; to be humiliated like that in front of your wife, how could he ever overcome that?\nSantiago decided to break the awkward silence. \u201cYou ever seen one take a full shot like that before?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but they usually die after a few hundred meters or so. I\u2019ve never seen one go this long.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think it means?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe nothing, I don\u2019t know. Maybe I didn\u2019t get off as good a shot as I\u2014\u201d\nThe beeping of the proximity alarm interrupted Jonathan and he leaned forward to look at the flashing screen.\n\u201cIt\u2019s up ahead, twenty meters.\u201d\nThe rover slowed and Jonathan looked at Santiago. Sweat was trickling down his brow and he was gripping the dash tightly to keep his hands from shaking. Victoria was looking away; he had a feeling she couldn\u2019t stand the sight of her husband right now.\n\u201cThere!\u201d Santiago said.\nJust ahead of them, nestled against some trees, the efferusaur lay on its side, gasping deep breaths. It\u2019s head jostled up as the rover braked and Santiago jumped out with the ion rifle.\nHe walked closer to the beast than he needed to, kneeled, and fired. The beast let out an agonizing growl as the bolt hit it in the head.\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Jonathan said. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d\nThe efferusaur clamored to its feet, using the trees as support, let out a soft whine and disappeared again through the shrubbery. Santiago turned to Jonathan, his expression one of shock. But Jonathan had no answers for him.\n\u201cHave you ever \u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jonathan said, \u201cnever.\u201d\nSantiago climbed back in the rover, and they began the pursuit again.\nThey followed the trail of the creature for over three hours; daylight was beginning to fade, and the hunt was nearing an end, but the creature kept running. It wouldn\u2019t stop long enough for them to catch up.\n\u201cHow long do we chase it now?\u201d Santiago asked.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never seen one do this,\u201d Jonathan said, obviously shaken up himself. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen one want to live so badly.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do we do when night falls?\u201d\n\u201cWe have to leave. The species hunted most on this planet is nocturnal so all the anti-poaching patrols come out after nightfall.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u201d Santiago whined, frustrated, \u201cI want this damned thing!\u201d\nJonathan thought he sounded like a child, and it disgusted him. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get him in the next couple hours, you can\u2019t have him.\u201d\nSantiago fumed as they continued to pursue, occasionally glancing over at his wife. He had nothing to say to her. There was nothing he could say. No matter what they did or talked about from now on, that single act would define him in her eyes.\nThe proximity alarm beeped again.\nThe creature hadn\u2019t stopped but had instead slowed to a moderate pace. They slowed as well, just enough to catch up but keeping as silent as possible.\nSoon, they saw the colossal girth of the creature hobbling along its path. It was wavering, leaning too far to the side now and then, confused from pain and exhaustion.\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d Santiago said.\nJonathan didn\u2019t reply; he just watched the beast. The efferusaur turned once and glanced at the rover, then turned back and tried to quicken its pace.\n\u201cJonathan!\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jonathan said, distracted. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to shoot it from the rover.\u201d\nSantiago grabbed the ion rifle out of the backseat. He leaned out of the rover, flipping on the rifle and watching the creature stumble as it charged up.\nThere was a matter of honor involved. The creature had shown him to be a coward in front of his wife. There would be little to make up for this act, but at least in the creature\u2019s death Santiago would be brought a measure of revenge.\nThe rifle signaled it was ready to fire. Santiago took aim, purposely taking his time to get a good head shot. When he was certain the target would not be missed, he pulled the trigger.\nThe creature lurched forward and fell on its face, a deep laceration in the sensitive skin on the back of its neck. Santiago had drawn blood; it wouldn\u2019t be long now. He smirked to himself as he stopped the rover and looked back to Jonathan and his wife.\nJonathan and Santiago climbed out, walking cautiously toward the beast that was laying on its stomach, breathing quick shallow breaths. Santiago went back to the rover and pulled out the ion rifle.\n\u201cWhat are you doing? We can just wait,\u201d Jonathan said.\n\u201cNo, I want one good shot to end this.\u201d He glanced back at Victoria who was leaning out of the rover, watching nervously. \u201cShe won\u2019t forget this you know. Truth is, my boy, I don\u2019t think she really loves me. I don\u2019t think she ever really even liked me. But she tolerated me.\u201d He glanced hatefully at the wounded creature. \u201cI\u2019m afraid she may not even do that now.\u201d\nHe approached the beast, again getting too close, and aimed his weapon. Before he could fire, the massive head whipped around and the jaws of the efferusaur closed down not a meter from Santiago\u2019s face, the creature\u2019s hot breath covering him in spittle.\nSantiago flew back, landing hard on the ground before scrambling to his feet and running for the apparent safety of the rover.\nThe efferusaur climbed to its feet, glaring pitifully at Jonathan, and hobbled away once more through the trees.\n\u201cMy god,\u201d Jonathan said to himself.\n\u201cDon\u2019t just stand there!\u201d Santiago screamed. \u201cLet\u2019s go kill this damned thing!\u201d Anger had taken control of him, and he kicked the rover, banging his foot roughly against the metal siding.\nJonathan watched the spot where the creature had disappeared a moment and then headed back to the rover. He stood in front of Santiago and looked him in the eyes; the man was out of control with anger; he wouldn\u2019t stop until this creature was dead.\n\u201cWe\u2019re turning back,\u201d Jonathan said.\n\u201cWhat! Are you insane! We will do no such thing.\u201d\n\u201cYes, we will Santiago.\u201d\n\u201cHow much more do you want?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the money,\u201d Jonathan said, glancing behind him to the creature\u2019s path.\n\u201cI know what you want,\u201d Santiago said, his voice cracking with desperation. \u201cI had you checked out before I hired you. I heard you were the best hunter on the planet, but one with problems. Problems related to the law back on earth.\u201d\nJonathan glared at him.\n\u201cYou killed a man,\u201d Santiago said, \u201cI know all about it. I know you can never go back to earth. But you can buy your way out of crimes there. I believe for murder it\u2019s, ah, oh damn,\u201d he turned to his wife, \u201chow much for murder, Victoria?\u201d\nVictoria, still leaning out of the passenger side door watching the two men, remained silent. Staring at her husband as if he were someone else.\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Santiago said, \u201cI think 20,000 denima should cover it. Think Jonathan, you could go back to earth a free man. The law would leave you alone!\u201d\nJonathan, to his own surprise, didn\u2019t even consider it. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cGod damn it! Why not?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything Santiago, not man or animal, that wanted to live as much as that creature. He deserves his life.\u201d\nSantiago\u2019s eyes widened and he went into a fury. \u201cDamn you! You will do as I say or I will go straight to the Plutisian Criminal Authority, you hear me! I\u2019ll tell them they have a wanted fugitive poaching in their hills. A man that\u2014\u201d\nWhat sounded like an explosion rang out in the air around them, and Jonathan instinctively ducked.\nHe looked up and saw the efferusaur leap like a bird out of the brush and land near the rover, shaking the ground. Its massive head bit down and missed Santiago as he collapsed onto his back. Santiago, beyond fear, pointed the ion rifle and the efferusaur turned to retreat.\nSantiago rose, fury gripping him, and began chasing the beast on foot, swearing with every breath. The efferusaur disappeared into the vegetation and Santiago stopped running, his lungs on fire. As he kneeled down to catch his breath the great beast emerged from the jungle and sprinted for him.\nA shot rang in the air but Jonathan saw that Santiago had not raised his rifle. He was face down on the grass, a large gaping wound in the back of his head. The efferusaur clamped his teeth around the man\u2019s carcass and swallowed it in one bite. It looked at the rover, panting, and then turned and lumbered away.\nJonathan looked at Victoria. She was standing up in the rover, the antique rifle in her hands. She was trembling.\n\u201cIt was an accident,\u201d she said, tears beginning to well up in her eyes.\nJonathan glanced to where Santiago\u2019s body had been and then back at Victoria. \u201cYou could\u2019ve just left him.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d she said, panic rising in her voice. She threw the rifle to the ground.\n\u201cMost women that want their husbands dead hire someone else to do it.\u201d\n\u201cNo! I didn\u2019t want to kill him.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said in a flat voice. \u201cYou know, I was just starting to like him.\u201d\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I know it was an accident. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll tell the Criminal Authority. They\u2019ll have to believe me; there\u2019s no one else.\u201d\nJonathan took a deep breath and walked to the rover. She\u2019d started crying, he thought, but she\u2019d stopped just as suddenly. Crying on command certainly was a gift of the feminine gender.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve murdered,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat gives you the right to judge?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cSantiago said you did.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I was a soldier doing the job I was told to do. Because politicians later decided they didn\u2019t want to be responsible for what they ordered, we took the blame. It\u2019s different.\u201d He started the rover. \u201cBut like I said, I know it was an accident.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was.\u201d\n|\n|\n______\n|\n||\n|\n______","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}

McDermott","issue":"9","date":"February 2008","sitename":"AtomJack Magazine","hostname":"http:\/\/atomjackmagazine.com","filename":"lovesongofjackmcnally.html","text":"|\n|\nLovesong of Jack McNally\nby\nJ. M. McDermott\nWe forget\u2014we always forget\u2014exactly why things fall apart among friends.\nAlcohol. Air planes. Divorce. Aliens.\nI ran into Jack McNally at the old Black Dog on Throckmorton, east of downtown Fort Worth. That bar was a merging point between hipsters and college kids, and Jack and me were too old to be college kids. Roaches were more common than yuppies like me. Nobody ordered anything that came in a glass unless it was bought with a fake ID from some kid that hadn\u2019t been around long enough to notice the rats.\nJack McNally was still dressed like a hipster. He mostly fit right in except we were a couple years older than just about everybody there. He came here because he had always come here when he was in town. I only ran into him because he was in town indefinitely.\nHe and I both grew up in Fort Worth, but I went off to college and came home, and he had stayed out in New Orleans until that hurricane washed through and pushed everybody back to where their mothers and fathers still had the bedroom just like it used to be.\nI was in a suit because I was an insurance agent, and he was in jeans because he was a bartender now, hanging out in this college kid and hipster bar on his night off.\nLast I heard of him he was married, and his name was John, and he was working in a family business. He told me everybody called him\n\u201cJack\u201d now, and he had divorced the girl he had flown to London to marry. He had spent the last five years since his college diploma working for his ex-wife\u2019s father all day and all night until the old man had succeeded in shoving the family business between the daughter and Jack, that new husband no one had really wanted around.\nJack and I had never smoked out together, back in the day, but we had always meant to do it. We were friends in high school, in the way that people in high school can be friends with each other without seeing each other off campus. We were in the same English classes. I had been one year ahead in English, and he was one year older than me, and we were in the same classes. We had both made out with the same theatre girls and neither one of us really wanted to share stories about how far we\u2019d gotten with whom because we were both a little afraid that the other had gotten farther.\nThat was at a private school in the middle of Fort Worth. Back then, we both had to drive miles over highways in the morning to get to school on time from our different corners of the city. We lived too far apart to be close friends, but we were friends enough to drink together a while that night.\nThen, he graduated and went off to New Orleans, and I was still in high school for a year. Then, I graduated and went off to College Station. I graduated, and then I came home to south Fort Worth, and I had forgotten all about him.\nI had stopped smoking pot and cigarettes entirely after the aliens had abducted me. He had dirty, yellow teeth now and that lazy look in the eye that twinkled like too much marijuana.\nI never expected to see him again.\nWe forget\u2014we always forget\u2014exactly why we had never stayed in touch when we see someone like that again.\nJack McNally stopped hitting on the college girls long enough to pat me on the back and remember my name.\nWe talked about the teachers that had died since we had left.\nHis mother had died. She had been a teacher at our private school. I hadn\u2019t heard about that one. He asked me what I was up to, and I told him I was just the guy in a suit with the proverbial apple for a face. Referencing famous surrealist paintings is what yuppies have to do to hang in hipster bars. Jack told me about his hurricane-induced placeless-ness, his divorce. I bought him a beer. Life had kicked him around even more than me, and I had been abducted by aliens and transformed into something nearly inhuman. (I never told Jack about the aliens.)\nThen Jack disappeared into the crowd. He talked to the college girls in the room like he was going to win their heart someday. He worked that room. Every time I turned around, he was talking to some new girl that didn\u2019t mind the free drink but wouldn\u2019t mind if Jack left, either. Jack was cracking jokes and mugging and smiling and talking about philosophy because he had majored in that in college and this was a hipster bar where that sort of thing was supposed to work. He was puffing cigarettes as if they weren\u2019t responsible for his yellow teeth and talking about MCATs because he wanted to be a neurologist.\nHe came back to me from his rounds. When he and I were talking, I encouraged Jack to be a nurse because he\u2019d never make it through medical school if he was the same guy I remembered \u2013 the same guy that I was watching right now. I encouraged him to think about nursing because nurses usually make more money than doctors after you do a cost benefit analysis including years spent in school, pay raises, and all those debts.\nAliens had taught me to think like a businessman about everything.\nAfter Jack had faded into the background noise again, I leaned over to the woman next to me \u2013 she was older than me by about seven years, but she was still beautiful and she was dressed in designer clothes. She didn\u2019t give a shit about anyone buying her drinks. I asked her if she had ever met that guy, Jack McNally.\nShe said she had never met that guy. She asked me why I wanted to know.\nI shrugged. \u201cJust trying to make conversation, I guess,\u201d I said, \u201cif you had met him, we could talk to each other about that guy.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met him,\u201d she said. She pulled out a cigarette and leaned over like I was supposed to light it for her. I didn\u2019t smoke, but I had a lighter.\nThen, I asked her if she knew the meaning of life.\n\u201cNever waking up alone,\u201d she said, without hesitation. She gazed into the red tip of her cigarette. She looked at me past the embers. \u201cWhat do you think it is?\u201d\n\u201cI was going to say something else, but I like your answer better.\u201d\n\u201cThey always do. What were you going to say?\u201d\n\u201cGenuine human connections.\u201d\n\u201cSame thing,\u201d she said.\nI agreed with her at the time.\nJack McNally waved at me from between two girls in red dresses\u2014two girls that looked like Momma\u2019s make-up and fake IDs from where I stood across the bar, by the doorway. The two girls in red dresses leaned back to make eyes at each other behind Jack\u2019s back, and they were laughing about the creepy guy over ten years older than them who thought he stood a chance in hell. Jack looked like he was king of the world right there, between those two pretty girls\u2014like he didn\u2019t know a damn thing.\nI left with the older woman. In the back of my mind I thought about Jack McNally with his yellow teeth and the glaze beneath his pupils from that way natural disasters have of humbling arrogant hipsters. Disaster: his bartending certificate was worth more than his philosophy degree. Disaster: his mother died so young. Disaster: his marriage failed. Disaster: he lost that family business in the divorce. Disaster: a hurricane threw him out of his beloved city, like God was kicking his ass.\nEven from the door, I heard Jack rattle off his lines too loud about the MCATs to girls too young to really know what that means, but old enough to know a line when they hear one.\nIn my mind, I wished him all the best luck in the world.\nThe older woman and I walked down the street because she didn\u2019t live far away. She lived in a building downtown, in a loft like an artist, but she wasn\u2019t an artist. She was only a seducer of artists. Her last boyfriend was a junky actor that had left her for a college girl in a red dress. Now, she wanted a rebound fuck from a warm body. I was warm enough.\nHer bedroom was up a flight of stairs. It smelled like old sex. In the slanting light of her setting the mood with candles, I saw the stains on the sheets that hadn\u2019t been washed properly in weeks.\n\u201cTake off your shoes,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI want to see the soles of your feet.\u201d\n\u201cFeet are your thing?\u201d She kicked off her shoes. She sat on her bed. She lifted her right foot up to my face. \u201cI like feet guys.\u201d\nI took her foot in my hand. I stroked it like a kitten.\nShe liked it.\nI asked her, \u201cDid you know that you have three souls?\u201d\n\u201cFuck,\u201d she said, laughing, \u201cI didn\u2019t think I had any.\u201d\nI kissed her big toe, gently. \u201cYou have three,\u201d I said, \u201cI learned this from some aliens. You have a soul hidden in the bottom of your feet, and then you have the soul in your spinal column, and then there\u2019s a soul just inside of your eyes. Everybody has three souls. You can live without the soul in your feet, and the one in your eyes. The one in the feet is just the energy that\u2019s fallen away and collected where it\u2019s like an id puddle, and the one behind the eyes is extra soul to filter your head from the energies in the air. But the one in your spinal column can live forever if you process it just right. That\u2019s the real you. That\u2019s your electricity.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about? Where did you say you got that?\u201d\n\u201cAliens.\u201d\n\u201cLike immigrants, or like fucking space?\u201d\n\u201cBoth. I was abducted by aliens, and they\u2019re taking over the world a little bit at a time.\u201d I ran my hands along the bottom of her right foot. When I wasn\u2019t talking, I was sucking on her toes like popsicles. They tasted almost as bitter as her voice sounded, but what did I expect meeting an older woman at a hipster bar with a sex dirty bed?\nShe leaned back. \u201cThat feels good,\u201d she said, \u201cbut tell me about your aliens, crazy boy. Did they anal probe you?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said, \u201cThey also sent me on a mission to anal probe others.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t anal probe me,\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t like it. Fuck, you are a toe-sucking fiend! Keep doing that. I like that. It feels amazing.\u201d\nI was finished with three of her toes by now. I had started with her big toe because it took the longest and I had moved down the line to the last two toes. I stopped to take a breath. \u201cThese aliens,\u201d I said, \u201cThey caught me in a field drunk and cow-tipping with some hicks outside College Station. They took me into outer space. They anal probed me. They did all kinds of crazy shit to me. They made me kill those fucking hicks and process them because they wanted to show me the future.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did the aliens look like?\u201d\n\u201cThey looked like aliens. Big, black eyes and big, white, light-bulb heads. Their skin was gray and spongy. They only had three fingers on each hand. They were fucking aliens.\u201d I finished the last two toes on the right foot. I put it down on the dirty carpet and picked up the other foot. I started with the big toe.\nShe leaned back and moaned a little. She pulled at her shirt until her small breasts looked up at me like melted teacups. \u201cYou should be a writer. You tell some crazy fucking stories. My ex was like that. He was an actor, and a junky. I told you about him, right? I fucking hate drugs, but I keep falling for junkies. Suck my nipples next, crazy boy,\u201d she said. Her nipples were erect already.\nI finished her toes and complied with her request. I got her right nipple first. Then, her left. She had her eyes closed by now. She had lost enough blood that she was completely out of her head. She started muttering men\u2019s names, like she couldn\u2019t remember mine and was having a brainstorming session out loud.\nI got her legs next. Then, I anal probed her, searching for the soul that hides in the spinal column to the brain. I got that next. After that, I kept taking her, piece by piece, until there was nothing left but all the blood she had lost.\nWhen I was done, I rummaged around her apartment for a cable outlet. I couldn\u2019t find one in that old building, so I had to use a telephone jack. I flipped my thumb open like a pez dispenser. I pulled out the right cord. I plugged my left thumb into the wall, and waited in the dark until sunrise for all the data to transfer. Just like when I sold an insurance policy, I had to plug the computer into the wall and wait for the data to transfer. When I process a body, I plug into the wall and wait for the data to transfer. Telephone jacks took longer.\nWhen I was done, I washed the blood off my clothes in her washer\/dryer, and washed up all the blood with bleach and club soda. It was morning, now.\nI had a sales meeting in the morning. I put my suit back on; I put on my white smile. I drove to North Dallas from downtown Fort Worth to meet with the sales team.\nIn our district, we had about eighteen people. Some of them were so far out in the countryside that they couldn\u2019t always make sales meetings. Usually only seven or eight showed up for the meetings regularly. We were all ages, from all walks of life. None of us were married, though. A couple were divorced with kids.\nMy boss was from Idaho. He was six foot eight, and shaped like a walrus complete with the scraggly beard. He had recruited me right out of college. My senior year, I went to a big city jobs convention, and he was there and we shook hands and we knew each other right then and there wasn\u2019t a need for an interview because the aliens had already interviewed me.\nHe had brought us donuts. I didn\u2019t eat the donuts because I knew they wanted me to keep skinny. An older guy could be a little hefty, and a girl just had to be female, but younger guys couldn\u2019t process anything if they weren\u2019t skinny.\nWe spent an hour talking about the changes to the disability plans, then he told us each individually how we were doing meeting our quotas.\nWe clap for each other. We cheer. I\u2019ve been here five years. In my mind, I can\u2019t help but think about the faces I don\u2019t see. Sometimes, someone just disappears from the table, and nobody tells us why.\nWe clap, we cheer, and we smile like we mean it. Everybody\u2019s missed quota a few times. Nobody knows exactly where the tipping point might be. Nobody asks.\nI was lucky I had gotten that older woman last night, barely in time to meet quota. My boss and I were going to have to meet in person after the sales meeting. While everyone else was out selling insurance policies and employee benefit plans, I was going to be in an office explaining how I wasn\u2019t collecting the souls the aliens wanted, and I wasn\u2019t exceeding the quota.\nWe had a talk, him and me, about what my real priorities were.\nI told him that I had been doing this for years just fine, and I was in a dry spell, and I was having doubts about the aliens that never felt the need to prove the paradise to us lately.\n\u201cGet over it,\u201d he said, \u201cHumanity is counting on you. If you want anyone to survive the tipping point, you have to process them for us. I know the aliens don\u2019t really feel the love like you and I do, but they are giving us our only chance.\u201d\n\u201cI miss sleeping,\u201d I said, \u201cI miss dreaming.\u201d\nMy boss shrugged. \u201cYou writing books, still?\u201d\n\u201cI am.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you think you have time to do that if you\u2019re asleep? You\u2019ve been here long enough to know how gifted we are\u2014how special we are. Nobody else has the opportunities we do. Everyone we process is rebuilt on the other side, and we get extra time in our day because we never have to sleep, and we get these great products to sell to people to help them survive a little longer past the tipping point so we can save even more of them. We\u2019re like angels.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to sound negative, sir\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have time for negativity,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should take a week off from sales and get your priorities straight. Take it as an opportunity to research the environmental disasters brewing right now, and save a few good girls. You were a true believer, and I know you will be again. You just need to think about your priorities a while.\u201d He glanced down at his watch. \u201cYou\u2019d best head to the rest room. I don\u2019t want any blood in my office. Be sure to pick up the new disability packets on your way out.\u201d\nI looked at my watch, too, and cursed it. I took off for the restroom as fast as I could. My stomach twisted up and grumbled before I made it all the way down the hall.\nWe had the processing system down by now. We knew exactly when my expulsion would hit based on how long it\u2019s been since the download.\nIn the restroom, the diarrhea hurt enough to make me have to bite down in my tie. I bit down on the smaller end because sometimes I got all the way through. When I turned around afterwards I saw chunks of the woman\u2019s bones floating in a rainbow of bodily organs and fluids.\nI went to work, after that. I sold insurance. I went to a caf\u00e9 after work, with a fancy laptop, so I could write a novel, or a short story, or anything to help me drown out the doubts in my head.\nI had seen the aliens rebuild the hicks when I had first processed them.\nI was supposed to trust them to rebuild everyone else I sent to them through the wires.\nJack didn\u2019t know that about me, and I never told him, and I never will.\nDuring my week off, I sent one of my books out in the mail. A couple months later, someone bought it. I was still working in insurance, and I was still processing women. But I felt better about it because the aliens made me so I never had to sleep, and that meant I had so much time to write, and I was doing something I had always wanted to do that was mine and wasn\u2019t part of anyone else\u2019s plans.\nI told Jack about the book the next time I saw him.\nWe forget\u2014we always forget\u2014exactly why people fall apart. We look back and think fondly of the good times and a purple haze descends over the strange tension in the air that had pushed people away from each other like magnetic polarities.\nMoney. Alcohol. Bad Music. Slow Cars.\nI ran into Jack McNally again at Black Dog, the same hipster bar, on another day after I had sold a book. Jack came over long enough to hear how I was excited because I had just sold this book I had written. I bought Jack a beer. He asked me what it was about, and I wanted to hit him. I did hit him. I punched him in the gut. I didn\u2019t punch him hard. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s fucking about!\u201d I shouted.\nThat pissed him off. \u201cAnybody can hit anybody!\u201d he said, \u201cHow can that be what your book is about?\u201d He hit me just as I had hit him.\nI realized that I hit a lot harder than he did. I wanted to hit him again, and I didn\u2019t really know why.\n\u201cI fucking hate post-modernism!\u201d I shouted, drunk, \u201cAll that cold rationality! Where\u2019s the fucking heart, the fucking emotion!?\u201d I punched him in the shoulders, the arms, the stomach. I wasn\u2019t hitting hard enough to damage him\u2014just making a point.\nHe punched back. \u201cI fucking hate post-modernism, too!\u201d he shouted, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to hit anybody!\u201d\nWe hit each other for a while, me pulling my punches so we didn\u2019t end up in a fist fight, and him hitting about as hard as he actually could and working up a sweat.\nWeird thing was, we both wanted to fight each other. I could see it in his eyes, how he hated me and he wanted to hurt me. I wanted to hurt him, too.\nThen, we debated whether Rumi was Arabic or Persian. I knew Rumi was Persian, but I wanted to give him something he could hold over my head. He didn\u2019t have anything he could hold over my head except the aliens.\nAlso, we talked about how much we loved all those post-modern authors. We fucking loved post-modernism.\nHe smiled and he told me that he hated my guts. I think the smile was a lie. He was just baring his teeth. He hated me because he wanted to write a book. He wanted to be an author. He wanted to be the proverbial guy in a suit with a green apple for a face that was always leaving with the beautiful woman, always paying for drinks with fresh cash and driving a nice car to a nice place far away from parents and shipwrecks and tooth decay.\nI asked him what he had been doing with all his time, and he told me he had been working for his ex-wife\u2019s family company before the divorce, then bartending, studying for the MCATs, and taking some biology classes at the university so he could be a neurologist. He had a Philosophy degree and a broken marriage and the cigarettes and the jobs at hipster bars. This was supposed to be the kind of thing he\u2019d do, eventually, but he never had.\nI was living all of his broken dreams. He didn\u2019t say that out loud. Instead, Jack introduced me to this blonde girl and this gay guy that everyone had known in high school but me. I couldn\u2019t remember their names, and they couldn\u2019t remember mine. We bar hopped together for a while. We ended up at this place on the edge of downtown because of a jukebox that played \u201cThe Payback\u201d by James Brown. When Jack drove us there \u2013 he shouldn\u2019t have been driving but he was \u2013 the blonde who was sweet on me was trying to find common ground in music. We had nothing in common. Jack didn\u2019t help because he took her side of things and refused to change the subject. The gay guy realized everyone in this car was straight so he kept staring out the window at the men in the street who were probably just homeless bums. Hope springs eternal to the drunken and the horny.\nAnd that blonde, she kept singing along to music I didn\u2019t like, and she kept insisting that I had to like this song. I had to love this band. Jack was saying how I was full of shit and didn\u2019t know shit because I didn\u2019t know shit about this band.\nIn the last bar, we fed enough quarters into the jukebox to make James Brown sing until mid-afternoon. Those three white hipsters danced and mugged like black soul singers. I watched them do it, a little horrified at it. The rest of the bar ignored us for their own private Casablancas.\nI guess I wasn\u2019t drunk enough, yet. We played pool until nobody could remember who was stripes or solids. Then we all drove off into the night in our separate cars as if we all weren\u2019t too drunk to drive.\nAnd all of us alone at the end of the night, and nobody had anybody\u2019s phone number, because we had all ran into each other, fallen together for a while, and then disappeared into the street lights like nothing had happened, and no one had really connected to each other, and none of us were really friends.\nI had to stop at a strip club on the way home and pay money for the quota. Dirty ones like that, all covered in pastels and powders and glitter make me sick for a week. I have headaches from all the beauty products and illegal drugs. The strippers that do it for money always have kids somewhere waiting for their momma to make enough money to buy them a better nasty apartment, a little closer to the meth dealer\u2019s place.\nAnd my boss fucking hates it when I send him one of those. I have to tell him that I didn\u2019t know how nasty she was when I met her. Even strippers can put on clean clothes and go to a bookstore. My boss never told me how many warnings I got before they shut me down. I had had a few warnings about not meeting quotas and sending in girls that didn\u2019t belong in human paradise. I had that fear like what salesmen get that gives them a desperate edge if you look at them just right.\nI didn\u2019t tell my boss about it, but I blamed Jack at the time, and I wondered why he and I had ever considered ourselves friends.\nWe forget\u2014we always forget\u2014exactly why people drift away from each other. I told myself that I wasn\u2019t going to hang out with Jack anymore. Something about him, and I didn\u2019t know what, kept humans from coming together. Some people, they carry dissipation on their shoulders like bad weather that never leaves.\nI felt like maybe the hurricane came to New Orleans simply because Jack called the place his home at the time. If I sent him to paradise, the place would melt in too much rain just because he was there to spoil everything. So, thinking about Jack McNally, I figured what the aliens were saying about selectivity was probably right.\nStill, I thought about processing Jack McNally, to save him from his own miserable life, and give him another chance to start over somewhere new because I felt sorry for the guy, and for some reason I had this weird feeling that we were friends once for an hour or two or a few moments in time.\nWhat we do with the people we process is this: we download their DNA, and the three souls. We rebuild them in space, one cell at a time like watching a bloody rice krispy treat melt into a puddle of pink human all dazed and confused and scared shitless about the transformation.\nThe aliens are doing this up there because humans are an endangered species down here.\nWe barreled past the environmental tipping point decades ago. The glaciers will melt. The jungles will die. The dwindling algae in the oceans will drain the world of fresh air. The cities will fall to our own natural disasters. The living things here will die and die for generations. We won\u2019t understand we\u2019re fucking each other after the end of the world until the oceans rise in a flood of melted ice one awful year of rising water to claim all the ardent environmentalists left alive. Anyone left will be in the mountains, and maybe they\u2019ll figure out a way to survive, but they\u2019ll probably be too busy killing each other over the last resources to do what really needs to be done to survive more than a couple generations. People don\u2019t tend to plan cosmically. Then, there won\u2019t be anyone left.\nAll of us are going to be Jack McNally, soon, shipwrecked and dying, and we don\u2019t even comprehend the where or why of it all.\nThat\u2019s what the aliens had told me up there, in the spaceship.\nWhen I was abducted, I was with these meat science and technology graduate students\u2014a bunch of hicks pursuing PhDs. They showed me around the agricultural facilities in the dark while we were all hammered, and we were tipping cows because they were mad at a professor for canceling their research project.\nI felt like an idiot because I was a dean\u2019s list English major, and I felt dumber than these drunken hicks throwing science terms around the asses of cows, and every single one of them on the drunken edge of dropping out.\nThen, the aliens got us all in a flash of light.\nThey flushed the alcohol out of us with needles and tubes, and it hurt worse than anything I\u2019d ever felt. They pulled our souls out from our asses \u2013 us screaming like we\u2019re dying of pain\u2014and they showed the souls to us on a computer screen. They explained things to us without souls around to muck up our primitive reasoning. Then they gave us our souls back, and that hurt, too. They picked me because the computer said my soul was the best for the mission.\nI had my guts opened, and changed. I had my arm bones peeled out and replaced with strange technology. My throat and teeth were rebuilt into something new. They pointed at the hicks, who were strapped down, now, naked and screaming for God to save them from this nightmare.\nThe aliens never asked my permission. I\u2019m angry about that. But nobody asked the dolphin if it wanted the radio tag pierced into the dorsal fin, and nobody asked the chimpanzee if he wanted to be a cosmonaut, and it was the same thing to the aliens.\nThe hicks were passed out. I was told to start my pre-programmed task. I was horrified, but I had been horrified for quite a while now so this new horror was nothing. I started at the bottom of their feet. I climbed up the top of their knees. I anal probed them with my altered organs before I ate their torsos, to pull out their souls. I devoured them toe to head.\nThen, the aliens showed me how to download the DNA and the souls together with my new hand. They even showed me in front of my eyes how people came back to life after I processed them. It looked real, to me, but part of me is never completely certain any of this is real. Afterwards, I watched them be rebuilt before my eyes. They were going to paradise. I was going back down to earth. I was told to expect messages to come back to me when I plugged into the wires. The aliens told me where to find my new boss, and what I\u2019d be doing for a living now, during the day.\nThat\u2019s how I found my place as an insurance agent. That\u2019s how I know my quotas, and what the aliens tell me about the people I saved, how they\u2019re so happy now. I guess every job comes with inspirational e-mails.\nThe aliens\u2014and my boss\u2014told me to go find the kind of people who could carry the species bravely into this brand new colony, where the grass is green, and the trees are perfect, and the future is full of hope like I can\u2019t even imagine because I\u2019ll never go there.\nMy boss liked to call us merciful angels. He liked to give us rousing speeches about what the alien paradise is like for the people we chose, who consented to go when they consented to sleep with an angel. We\u2019re supposed to fall in love with the people we\u2019re saving. We\u2019re supposed to believe that we\u2019re saving them and save them because we love them.\nThe other thing my boss talked to us about during our little meetings was how sometimes we spent too much time in hipster bars, and strip clubs. We had to save some church girls, some college kids, some upstanding citizens. We had to stop saving bar flies. The aliens wanted people with hope in paradise. We didn\u2019t want to doom paradise to the same fate that was happening here by sending them too many losers.\nI had been hearing that for five years. I had been looking around the room at new faces, where old faces disappeared.\nWe said hello to each other in the meetings. We knew each other\u2019s names. We knew each other\u2019s territories. At the end of the workday, I wasn\u2019t the guy looking to grab a drink with a co-worker. I was afraid of them, and of what might happen if people learned the truth about the people I was saving sometimes, too much. I was destroying them because they were like me, or I was saving them because they were like me.\nWe were not supposed to save the people like Jack McNally\u2014the people like me.\nTooth decay. Alcohol. Gasoline. Hurricanes.\nI ran into Jack McNally again, one more time. I sat down next to him on the smoker\u2019s patio in a caf\u00e9 in the museum district. He was studying the menu for a restaurant across the shopping complex. He was a bartender there, now, starting soon.\nHe asked about my clothes.\nI had had insurance meetings in the area, and I had figured jogging in the nearby park would be a better use of my time than grinding home in traffic. I had changed out of my suit, and into my running clothes. Since there was still traffic, I was going to get a drink and write for a while. I told him how I once sat down and did the math and even with the occasional pastry indulgence, waiting in a caf\u00e9 for an hour or two while traffic dies is cheaper than the gas it costs to drive home in bumper-to-bumper traffic. I had written a book doing this. I had read a hundred books doing this. \u201cTime-management,\u201d I had said.\nHe lit another cigarette.\nI asked him how he was doing.\nHe pulled his answer out of his cigarette. \u201cFine,\u201d he said, \u201cStarting microbiology in the fall. Just studying for those MCATs.\u201d\nI looked over his shoulder, and he was studying the salads and which ones came with what kind of sauce.\nHe saw me do that. We looked each other in the eye.\nWe sat in silence.\nNothing happening for a long time.\nThe wind picked up. The wind died down. Cars drove like beams of neon light over the highway bridge past the shopping complex.\nThen, I said it was great seeing him again, and I\u2019d probably run into him someday soon. We had been running into each other everywhere, after all.\nThen, I was typing inside that caf\u00e9, with a beautiful young woman sitting across from me. We were talking about my day job and her schoolwork and all the stupid things that people talk about in cafes. We were talking about religion and neurology as if we knew a damn thing about the afterlife and the chemistry of souls.\nJack came in reeking of cigarette smoke. He stopped a moment to say hello to the beautiful girl I was talking to, like he hoped for an introduction. He patted me on the shoulder like he was proud of me for meeting this beautiful girl. He congratulated me with a smile and a nod and a wink.\nShe saw him do it, too. Her eyes changed at that.\nI wish Jack hadn\u2019t done that. I could smell how clean her skin was from where I sat across from her. I looked in her face and saw no make-up. I saw what women wore make-up to look like. I saw a soul in her eyes that would spill from her spine like drinking water in a desert. I felt hope from her like something so beautiful I could taste it. I wanted to save her, because I was in love with her like I was supposed to be.\nThen, Jack McNally showed up.\nI wish Jack the best, and I wish him all the luck in the world. I also wish not to run into him again. He saved her life without even knowing it, in a way, and it occurred to me that Jack and I were never friends, and if we were ever friends, we weren\u2019t anymore, and we would never be friends again. Fuck Jack McNally and everyone like him.\nHe\u2019s probably writing about me in his malformed, soon-to-be-abandoned book right now, shaping my narrative to suit his own glory. I probably did the same with him right now.\nThat\u2019s because we look backwards and shape our own story. We forget\u2014we always forget\u2014exactly why things fall apart.\nTooth decay. Hipster Bars. Hurricanes.\nLonely death.\nJ. M. McDermott is an author of short fiction, poetry, and his first novel, LAST DRAGON, just came out this February from Wizards of the Coast Discoveries.

Today, the September was attacked and sunk by a rogue submarine from the Humanity Conservation Alliance. No one saw the torpedo coming until it was too late to do anything but sit and watch and fathom what was happening. I was just fifty meters underwater by then, so I had the ideal view. Front row seats. Box tickets.\nThe flash and the effect of the explosion were dulled, but my imagination filled in the blanks. Captain Yuri\u2019s face as he watched the bow turn into a shower of metal splinters, just before his beard was seared off by an oncoming locomotive of two thousand degree Celsius flames. The second of perplexity displayed on the faces of the scientists in the lab below deck, as all the glassware shattered simultaneously and they had a moment to wonder what in the world before they disintegrated.\nThe hydraulic tube lowering the elevator snapped at once. All three of us cried out to God, sensing but not perceiving. Around us, grey fish scattered and distant shapes loomed and the broken, mangled innards of the September rained down to the abyss, and the sea devoured it all.\nIt took us four hours to sink, half the time it took the Alvin on its maiden voyage. Four hours of listening to Eddie Carroll cry out, \u201cJesus H. Christ. Oh Joseph and Mary and Matthew Mark Luke John we are in some deep trouble.\u201d\n\u201cNice pun,\u201d Doctor Conners remarked.\n\u201cHow can you joke, man?\u201d Eddie was doing his best to pace around the small elevator in his pressure suit, which was constantly hissing bubbles as it adjusted to the ever-increasing water pressure. \u201cHow can you joke? They\u2019re all dead up there. Vinny, Martin, Sara . . . all gone, man. And on top of that, we\u2019re sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean! Do you realize that?\u201d\n\u201cWe were going there anyway,\u201d I pointed out.\n\u201cYeah. When we still had a ship to haul us back up! What are we gonna do? Christ, what are we gonna do?\u201d His voice was breaking.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to stay calm,\u201d I said, although I certainly didn\u2019t feel like following my advice.\n\u201cDon\u2019t get your sweet little grad student wetsuit in such a bunch.\u201d\nNone of us saw the bottom coming, but the instant we hit each suit hissed a final time, the thin stream of bubbles immediately lost to the darkness. My knees buckled, and I grabbed the railing to steady myself. I looked at the faces of my two colleagues for this little adventure mission\u2014pale as drowned men. But neither of them had collapsed on impact, which was lucky, because if their suits had hit the elevator floor the wrong way and been punctured, even a pinprick, it was all over for them. There was now about three thousand meters of water above us, pushing down, and pushing down hard. Our suits would keep us alive, though. Our suits would keep us alive.\n\u201cJesus,\u201d Eddie said, but this time it wasn\u2019t in the same scared voice. This time there was a note in it that I recognized. A note I had used on several occasions. It spoke of awe. I followed Eddie\u2019s gaze over my shoulder.\nThe abyssal plain is the flattest piece of land on the planet. It covers roughly forty percent of the ocean floor. It is also the least explored area on our planet. After the deep space explorations and technological advances of the last half century, this place, so close to home, is the last frontier. We were going to explore it.\nThe lights on the sides of our heads penetrated the blackness for a distance of twenty feet once the initial dust from the impact settled. It was like driving across a desert in the middle of a cloudy night, with headlights ready for replacing. We stood in a triangle and saw a collective sixty square feet of nothing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like I imagined,\u201d Eddie said.\n\u201cYou have quite a bleak imagination then,\u201d Conners said.\nMinutes went by. No one said anything. At the apex of discovery, there is only observation. Discussion comes much later, in a lab.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan, Doctor?\u201d Conners asked.\nI took a few seconds to respond. I felt so blown away that I felt nothing. I simply stared as infinitesimal dust particles whirred by in a remnant of some far-off turbidity current. I followed them until they left the light.\nEddie answered before I did. \u201cI say we walk around a little bit, sightsee, and then find a nice little patch of sand in which to die.\u201d\n\u201cI have a signal.\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t work at these depths, you know that,\u201d Conners said.\nI nodded. \u201cI guess we take Eddie\u2019s advice then. We walk.\u201d\nEddie snorted. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d\n\u201cWhere will we go?\u201d Conners asked.\n\u201cI have a compass, here.\u201d It was attached to my belt. I was currently facing south. I turned left and pointed. \u201cThat way. Toward the ridge.\u201d\n\u201cThen what?\u201d Eddie said. \u201cClimb high enough to use the signal?\u201d I nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re out of your damn mind.\u201d\n\u201cHow long do we have in these suits?\u201d Conners asked.\n\u201cPerhaps five days.\u201d\nEddie shook his head and fanned his hands parallel with the sediment, as if to say, \u201cThere, the line is drawn.\u201d\n\u201cNo. No way. You guys go ahead if you want. I\u2019m staying here. This is ridiculous. Some cruel higher power thought it\u2019d be fun to give us a nice, slow, tortuous death, but I\u2019m not having it. I\u2019ll sit my ass down right here and when I get bored, I\u2019ll pull my plug.\u201d\n\u201cShut up, Eddie. You\u2019re coming.\u201d Conners turned and began to walk. I followed. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, so did Eddie.\nSeptember 14, 2058\nThe identity of our attackers was no real puzzle. The Humanity Conservation Alliance is a collection of competitive, ambitious, and hard-headed people who happen to be leaders of countries. With the Earth in its current dismal state, the HCA was formed between some of the more gung-ho (which in this case means \u201cscared\u201d) European countries like France, Italy, and Spain, in an effort to migrate the human population into space. The stations and colonies set up were a success, but a costly one. In constant need of maintenance, the stations are always on the brink of disaster.\nScientific debates on the quality of the Earth and the right courses of action to take led to political differences, which in turn gave rise to national tension. It came as no surprise when several US and Japanese exploration crafts reported feeling threatened by HCA submarines. I wasn\u2019t too surprised to learn that one such craft had been attacked and boarded in the north Pacific. The destruction of the September, however, came as quite a shock.\nThe amount of nothing on the abyssal plain is astounding. We know more about the surface of the moon than this place. No craters. No hills. Flat nothingness. I expect Hell to be like this, only with fire instead of water. Walking with that much pressure\u2014I couldn\u2019t remember the exact number, but an educated guess put it at a little over four thousand pounds\u2014is no easy feat. The suits, of course, make it possible. They are arguably the most advanced piece of exploration technology ever invented, but damn it is still a lot of work to walk.\nWe can\u2019t sit\u2014too sit would be to risk a breach. We knew this going in. Today, when we took breaks, we tried to turn our backs to the currents and lean against them slightly. I\u2019m sure this doesn\u2019t work, but it seems to have a soothing mental effect nonetheless.\nWe slept standing up last night. Thankfully, the suits are sturdy enough to not fall over; there is a little space between my wetsuit and the inside skin of the pressure suit.\nFortunately, we had planned to be down here a long time\u2014sixteen hours. Bags were hooked up in the appropriate places to catch our waste. Mine were both already getting full. A small box in the center of the suit contained food in liquid form, which was inserted through a thin syringe painlessly into the stomach. I wondered if it was really painless, or if there was just so much other pain to concentrate on that I didn\u2019t feel it.\nEddie is hopeless. Doctor Conners is mostly silent but for the few times he speaks to admonish Eddie\u2019s despair. I can\u2019t blame the kid though. I feel like despairing myself. But when there is nothing to look at but a blank screen of black water, you tend to look inward, at your memories. I think about my wife, Clara. My three daughters. The older two are twins. Their birthday is tomorrow. I had planned on taking them all out to sea to celebrate. The whole crew had a huge party planned as a surprise. Thank the Lord Clara held out for as long she did, because if it had been yesterday . . . .\nI choked on these thoughts and my throat longed for fresh water. Water, water everywhere. . . .\n\u201cYou okay, Miacha?\u201d Conners asked.\nI coughed, cleared my throat. \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cYour power level is reading less than ours.\u201d I heard the concern in his voice\u2014it was obvious, and frightening.\n\u201cMust be the log.\u201d\n\u201cShut it down, you\u2019ve got to conserve.\u201d\n\u201cNaw Doc, leave it on,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cI want the moment I fall over dead to go down in history. If I end up in heaven and look down and realize that you turned your friggin\u2019 log off at just the wrong moment, I\u2019m gonna be one very pissed off angel.\u201d\nI smiled in spite of myself. No one ever accused Eddie of not being a free spirit. But I turned the log off anyway.\nSeptember 15, 2058\nOne good thing about not having much food\u2014you don\u2019t shit as much.\nToday was Yvette and Yvonne\u2019s birthday. I was so sad I missed it. I thought about them all day as we walked. I thought of the day they were born, nine years ago. I had just docked when I got the call. No one had ever driven so fast. Looking back on how wild that ride was, going 120 in the pouring rain, probably scaring the shit out of every car I passed, brings a smile to my lips. It was worth it to be there to hold my two girls when they were still naked and bloody and the most beautiful creations God ever set out to make.\nI named the ship the September because all of our birthdays are this month. Mine\u2019s the second. Clara\u2019s is the nineteenth. Judy, our youngest daughter, barely made it in\u2014born at eleven forty-eight on the thirtieth.\nI wept silently. Of course, I couldn\u2019t wipe my tears away, but I wouldn\u2019t even if I could have. Some fell onto my lips and were reabsorbed, which I suppose was lucky since I needed to conserve what little fresh water I had in me. But if I suddenly died, right here in the middle of the endless nothing, I wanted those tears to be burned into my face so that my family would know that I thought of them to the end.\nEddie was quieter today. I wondered if he was having similar thoughts. His feet are dragging. Doctor Conners caught him from falling once, and for a brief second I thought it was all over, that in the act of saving Eddie, Doctor Conners had punctured both their suits. I didn\u2019t let out my breath until they were both standing upright and continuing on toward the ridge.\nI stepped on a skeleton today. Broke it into dust. I only realized what it was because the fish\u2019s left eye socket and a few teeth had not yet biodegraded. It occurred to me that we were walking on top of what could be a thousand meters of dead animals and sediment, mostly made up of red pelagic clay from oxidized iron. I did not mention this to Eddie.\nI turned off my light for most of the day to conserve my suit\u2019s power. It\u2019s not as if I\u2019m worried about running into something, after all.\nSeptember 16, 2058\nEddie\u2019s dead. It happened so fast I thought I was going to be next from a heart attack.\nHe had dropped back about five paces behind us. No one had uttered more than a harsh breath for hours when I heard him cough and moan through the radio. Conners and I both turned in time to see him slip sideways. He came down wrong on the corner of his food box, and it cracked. It was ripped from the suit and compressed into a pebble.\nI must believe that Eddie had passed out\u2014that he was unconscious, and so felt no pain. Thousands of pounds of water assaulted him through the gap in his suit. The exterior lights went out; the glass covering them broke and dissolved instantly. Eddie himself remained suspended for a moment, but then, with a sickening snap, the suit broke and Eddie Carroll was reduced to a pack of matter the size of a baseball.\nI might as well have been in a whirlpool. If Doctor Conners hadn\u2019t grabbed my shoulders at that moment and shouted through the radio, I\u2019m sure I would have met the same fate as Eddie.\n\u201cMiacha!\u201d He shouted. \u201cDon\u2019t faint, damn it! Don\u2019t puke!\u201d I must have been pale. I certainly felt it. Take deep breaths! Come on!\u2019\nI uttered a grunt that I meant as \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m okay,\u201d but what sounded more like \u201cAAAAHHPPPFFFT!\u201d\nSlowly, gradually, Conners swam back into focus. His eyes were large and lined with red pitchforks, but he seemed awake and aware. Far more so than I felt, anyway.\nWe left the ball of compacted Eddie to degrade into the sediment and continued on to the ridge.\nSeptember 17, 2058\nWe almost gave up today. The thirst almost got us. But then the floor began to slope upward.\nWhen there is nothing left but survival\u2014when there is no busy schedule of the day planned or important fundraising dinners to attend to or list of tasks to be completed in the lab before you can go home and hug your children and kiss your wife on the cheek so you can smell her hair and remember every moment you\u2019ve been through together\u2014then, hope is as real as the heart in your chest, as precious as your dearest beloved, as vast and full of life as the ocean itself.\nConners saved my life yesterday. I repaid him for it today. There was a clam on the floor, the first sign of living life we had yet seen. Conners knelt to examine it, and one of his knees popped. I just happened to be in the way of his fall. He collided with my hip and we both stumbled back a few steps before I was able to get my footing again in the soft sand. Afterwards, neither of us said anything. We were thinking of the baseball-sized ball of Eddie.\nHis knee was okay. Just the stress of standing on it and walking for miles. How far exactly? I wondered. It felt like triple digits, and I hoped it was so when I get back I can boast to those pinhead, eager grad students that I walked over a hundred miles across the abyssal plain.\nWe walked on. I have to keep the log entry short because I\u2019m running out of power.\nSeptember 18, 2058\nThe slope took us high enough to use the signal. It began blinking red at my belt and we both started crying with joy. We continued to climb for another half mile before stopping. We wondered who would come. The US Navy, we pictured, in their grandest submarine, with lights blaring and throwing the god-forsaken abyss into stunning clarity, illuminating the snaking path of our footprints. And we would stand on the slopes of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and wave our arms high in welcome and greet our saviors and finally be able to properly mourn our fallen friends.\nDeep down, I suspected we would see no such lights. The signal would do little more than alert them, whoever \u201cthey\u201d were, as to the location of our two corpses. But hope is real, and we held on to it.\nPower\u2019s about to die. When it does, there will be nothing to keep the thousands of pounds of water out. We sit in darkness.\nSeptember 19, 2058\nPower gone any second. Clara\u2019s birthday. Lights ahead. Coming.\nDevin Miller is a student at UNC and is just starting his writing career.

Her stomach stung with acid nausea. She recalled three of them earlier in her midmorning shopping. One had been a tall oppressive man who had glanced in her direction several times before guiltily donning a well-rehearsed smile and engaging in the fake perusal of last-minute gifts. People said that knowing you had one day left to live spiked your libido. It only made Sarah want to puke.\nNavizian was waiting for her, of course, standing erect against the gleaming silver chrome of his vehicle, and when they shook hands he didn\u2019t remark on the tremulous filaments of light hovering above her head.\n\u201cThis place doesn\u2019t seem to grow old,\u201d he said, and led them on a muddy path that serpentined up the western side of the main rock face. By implication she felt that they had both aged. And that, until his own filigree arrived, he would be fortunate enough to continue aging.\nHis romantic observation was rebutted by the torrid jets of yellowish bilge that tainted the edges of the streaming sheets of water, and Sarah tried hard to pretend that the waterfalls were as pristine as they had been years ago, that industry had not reached this place.\nThey stared at the falls, and she leaned dangerously into the decayed wooden railing. Splinters flew off towards the rabid cascades, lost in the concussion of water and stone. Navizian stood motionless. She edged on, assuming that he would reach out and grab her, then realized the absurdity of her expectation. Final day causality. She chuckled, a desultory laugh, and moved back. She studied Navizian. \u201cThanks for agreeing to see me,\u201d she said. \u201cI know this can\u2019t be easy for you.\u201d\nHe smiled gently.\nHe pointed up to the scalloped sun, swimming down now towards the murkiness of night. \u201cHow do you think they know?\u201d he asked.\nThe discs were invisible from their current altitude and orientation, but everyone had been force-fed the pictures a billion times over by the frenzied media, and those same discs orbited above them right now, tucked away behind layers of atmosphere and miles of vacuum.\n\u201cI have no idea. To be honest, I don\u2019t care. I do wonder who the hell they think they are,\u201d she said. \u201cDid we ask them to know? Who needs to know they have one day left, anyway? I sure don\u2019t.\u201d\nHe held out his hand. Sarah grazed it as she dropped her arms towards her side, then hugged herself through her woolen jersey.\n\u201cI need your help,\u201d she said. \u201cBut some things should remain as they are.\u201d\nShe saw a reddish tinge suffuse his cheeks.\n\u201cLoevler Unified,\u201d she went on. \u201cI\u2019ve done research. I remember when they hired you three years ago, it was a run-of-the-mill operation, just another highbrow research group suffering from impractical methods and lack of funding. But Loevler is turning out to be a regular Feynman. I\u2019ve followed some of his work, whatever\u2019s been leaked into the mainstream. If what I think is true, you could help save me.\u201d\n\u201cSave you?\u201d His voice distilled irony from incredulity.\n\u201cLet\u2019s cut the BS,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s working on a way to escape the twenty-four-hour period causality trap, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound very sane,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIs he or not?\u201d\n\u201cMy job,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did you come?\u201d\n\u201cI wanted to see you.\u201d\n\u201cLook at me, Navi,\u201d she said. \u201cLook at me. I won\u2019t be here much longer, so take a good look while you can.\u201d\nHe turned around. His voice was a hush.\n\u201cHe thinks he\u2019s found a way around it, Sarah.\u201d\n\u201cIs there any proof? Empirical evidence?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said.\n\u201cProof,\u201d she repeated.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nSarah moved only inches from him, set her jaw, gripped his shoulders. \u201cThen use whatever technology you have. Use it on me. I volunteer. I\u2019ve got nothing to lose. I know you don\u2019t trust me. How could you? But I\u2019m out of options. I know this hurts. It\u2019s wrong. But I can\u2019t do anything about that. I\u2019m too scared. I\u2019m scared of dying. I\u2019m fucking terrified. I didn\u2019t think I would be. I never did. But I am. Help me, Navi.\u201d Her words were impetuous thrusts, desperate implorations that knifed through his armor of resentment and doubt.\nFor the first time, Navizian seemed off balance. He faced her again, squinted, scratched the stubble on his jaw. His eyes roamed over her.\nHe nodded, like a leaf bowing in an autumn breeze.\nSarah removed her hands from his shoulders.\nShe said, \u201cSo tell me, how do you escape the final day causality?\u201d\nHe launched into his response, and his relief at discussing something intellectual, not emotional, was as tangible as the rails Sarah gripped. \u201cWell, this is what standard theory says. The filigree appears. You know you have twenty-four hours left. \u2018They\u2019 send it to us, in their infinite compassion, so we have one last day to put our affairs in order, because unexpected death is such a messy business.\u201d It was difficult for her to decide how much was sarcasm and how much reverence. \u201cNow, this is where it gets tricky. The appearance of the filigree itself can\u2019t be the cause of your death, since that would create a closed loop, and your death would be a-causal. If something appears to let you know you\u2019re going to die, and that in itself is the cause, you wouldn\u2019t have died if it hadn\u2019t appeared, reductio ad absurdum.\u201d\nShe sighed.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, speaking faster. \u201cSo. Anything that you do differently as a result of the filigree alerting you to your death cannot contribute to your death. You see it appear, you pull the trigger. Nothing happens. You jump off a building, you get up and walk away. You step into a nuclear reactor, you emerge unscratched. Quantum probabilities become jangled and they work to preserve you. Society tumbles into chaos. But, at the end of the twenty-four hours, you still die. Something gets you. Where\u2019s the flaw in all this?\u201d\nSarah bit her lower lip. As the evening shadows settled around them, she could see the faint glimmer of silver light-threads above her.\n\u201cI have no idea,\u201d she said. \u201cUntil Loevler, I was sure they\u2019d tried everything. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called a causality trap.\u201d\n\u201cNot quite everything,\u201d Navizian said. \u201cWhat if you knew about your death, outside of the twenty-four-hour period? How far back do you suppose the trap extends, in time?\u201d\nShe mulled it over. \u201cMaybe it cuts off exactly at the one day mark, maybe it recedes infinitely into the past. The point is, the filigree appears at that precise moment, so how does that help us?\u201d\n\u201cThe filigree appears at that time because that\u2019s when they choose to project it to us. But Loevler\u2019s found a way to retroproject it. And everything indicates there\u2019s no causality trap beyond that twenty-four period. You can break the chain.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve known you for twelve years,\u201d she said.\nIn the old days he would have been able to finish the thought for her, in his mind if not his words. But witnessing her flailing about for life had rendered him mute, unable to gauge her thoughts.\n\u201cI want you to know that during all that time, you\u2019ve never let me down. Not back then. And not now.\u201d\nShe turned and began back towards where they had parked their drivers. Dusk created new ripples in the falls and heightened the sound of the crashing water.\nHer pace was brisk. One time she trotted too far ahead, and she heard him mutter after stumbling on some pebbles. She realized that the faint luminosity of her death-symbol was all the illumination Navizian had on this descent. She tempered herself to keep her legs from bolting. She had revealed enough desperation already.\nOn the way down she said, \u201cMakuzo was such an ass. He really got me, that one time.\u201d\nNavizian\u2019s voice answered from behind. \u201cI think he scared himself, after they pulled you guys up.\u201d\nOn that excursion Makuzo had taunted and prodded until she had tripped on an outcrop and was left dangling from a sheer drop, her hands coiled around his left leg. Later he would complain that she\u2019d gripped him so tightly that her nails had dug blood from his skin, right through his jeans. It was Makuzo\u2019s Falls from that day, although Navizian could have claimed the namesake for himself, with his own brand of far more pleasurable taunting and prodding.\n\u201cI wonder what Makuzo\u2019s up to these days,\u201d she said.\nA pause. Then, \u201cHe\u2019s gone.\u201d\nShe turned, then continued walking.\n\u201cCancer last spring,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw the filigree. It wasn\u2019t \u2014-\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me it wasn\u2019t like mine,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI know that they\u2019re all different.\u201d\n\u201cI was going to say that it wasn\u2019t painful for him. Two months, and he knew it was coming. I think he\u2019d known for a long time, maybe even his whole life. Sometimes you just know.\u201d\nShe sensed a dark undercurrent to his words, as though he might be speaking of himself rather than Makuzo.\nShe reached the foot of the mountain some moments before him, and as soon as he had caught up with her, a little out of breath, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s go in my driver. We\u2019ll meet Loevler at the research center.\u201d\nShe looked in the direction of her own driver, hands in her pockets. \u201cMy life is in your hands.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be melodramatic. And don\u2019t misstate the nature of things: you\u2019re pretty much indestructible for the next nine hours.\u201d\nShe noticed that he averted his gaze from the glow of her filigree, almost as though the silver and gold strands of light, like a Medusa\u2019s nest of writhing snakes, might petrify him if he stared too long. What had started as politeness now verged on bathos.\nInside his vehicle, he commented on some of the brand-new features that her own model lacked. En route he activated a signal that let Loevler know they were on their way, minute-estimate of arrival included. Some moments later, Navizian asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t you program your driver to go back home?\u201d\n\u201cIf this works, I can remote activate it to pick me up in the morning. If not, it\u2019ll be a donation.\u201d\nMinutes passed and she became impatient. \u201cCan\u2019t you make this thing go faster? Disengage the safeties.\u201d\nThey picked up speed.\n#\nSarah felt unnatural drafts of cold air as they marched down the facility\u2019s narrow corridors, Loevler in the lead. He was a rotund fellow who scampered on like a rodent, just as she had seen in the threegrams. She and Navizian exchanged a conspiracy of smiles as they followed the bobbing, balding head.\nThey arrived at a room with several computers on a table alongside the back end and a rotary projector that extended from the ceiling.\n\u201cIf this is the central lab, I have to say I\u2019m not exactly overwhelmed.\u201d Sarah injected her words with a flippancy she did not feel.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the central lab,\u201d Navizian said, glancing uneasily at Loevler, who was entering commands into one of the workstations, too busy to respond.\nWhen he was done, Loevler pointed at some chairs, and they took his cue. Images from the projector formed in the air, and Loevler\u2019s running commentary provided the soundtrack. They were mostly pictures of a young boy with a hovering filigree. From Navizian\u2019s fidgetiness, she could tell something was amiss.\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to discuss the theoretical underpinnings of my work, fascinating as they are,\u201d the man said. His voice sounded gravelly, constrained by some unseen malaise. \u201cThis young man you see here is Michael, my son.\u201d\nThe boy was a pre-teen who appeared to be unaware he was being photographed in many of the snapshots. The word \u2018man\u2019 made the gallery display seem like a parody, one with unsettling overtones.\n\u201cMichael is a very bright young man, as you can tell from these pictures.\u201d The embarrassingly candid pictures revealed only a shy youngster clearly saddened by his filigree. \u201cHe deserves the chance to explore his potential. He deserves a future. This is what Loevler Unified is about. Michael will be back with us. Soon.\u201d\nNavizian said, \u201cLoev, what\u2019s going on here? What\u2019re you talking about?\u201d\nSarah gathered that there were some things which had been kept even from him.\n\u201cWhy do you think I\u2019ve dedicated six years of my life to studying the causality trap, son?\u201d Loevler asked, demonstrating no qualms about his choice of words.\n\u201cTo escape it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why should I care to do that? I\u2019m quite alive, myself.\u201d\n\u201cBecause the consequences would be far-reaching. It would mean --\u201d\n\u201cIf we can break causality, anything is possible. We can reshape the past. We can create our own futures. Michael and I can be together again.\u201d\nImages of Michael continued to display in the air. When they had finished, Loevler seemed to relish the moment, beaming with pride.\n\u201cWe still have a lot of work ahead of us tonight. Let me start by sharing some of our evidence with you, Miss Grennel. Follow me.\u201d\n#\nOnce in the main lab the evidence was wheeled in by two nondescript assistants.\n\u201cI could have shown you with the projector, of course,\u201d Loevler said, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t want you to feel that I was being deceitful. No threegrams here, just live flesh.\u201d\nSarah leaned over the bed and her finger poked at the man\u2019s immobile torso. No reaction. She wondered just how alive this flesh was.\nShe studied the man\u2019s eyes, which remained fixed on infinity, and drew her head several millimeters from his chest and his nostrils, struggling to detect any movement associated with breathing. There was none.\n\u201cThis man\u2019s dead,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAlmost, Sarah, but no,\u201d Navizian corrected.\nHe passed his hand through the filigree that hovered above the subject\u2019s head. It rippled and reformed, like the filigrees always did, and everything seemed to be exactly as before, but Sarah didn\u2019t miss the subtle facial contraction that had accompanied the disturbance.\nLoevler projected the man\u2019s vital signs, and Sarah saw at once that they were not flat. He explained each one to her, and to prove to herself she had understood, she said, \u201cSo he\u2019s in a coma.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s as good a description as any,\u201d Navizian agreed. \u201cBut it\u2019s an unusual coma, in the sense that we could rouse him out of it.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you?\u201d She was curious but her voice carried the weight of a challenge.\n\u201cIf we did, he would have only a few moments to live,\u201d Loevler said.\n\u201cOk. So we have a man in a coma, with a filigree.\u201d\n\u201cLook carefully at the vitals,\u201d Navizian said. \u201cCheck how far back the data goes.\u201d\nShe did, then blinked. \u201cTwo days.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo days.\u201d\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\u201cTwo days ago is when the filigree first appeared.\u201d\nThey played back a threegram recording for her which showed the last two days at compressed speed, and matched the vital signs data.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the first successful subject to be alive beyond the twenty-four hour filigree mark. When the filigree appeared, we were able to manipulate it, to retroproject it one point three days in time before that moment. That gave the subject enough time to change his course of action, and to agree to this coma. Causality was successfully interrupted, and he lives. We could keep him like this forever, but we\u2019re confident that after tonight\u2019s experiment that won\u2019t be necessary. If we\u2019re able to break causality farther back in time, he\u2019ll have a lot more options. We\u2019ll all have more options, including yourself.\u201d\nWhen Loevler spoke, it was hard for Sarah not to imagine that he was describing the detailed ingredients of a fashionable cocktail, or recollecting the high points of a sporting event, and she had to force herself to concentrate on the seriousness of his words. Remembering the images of Michael helped. So did Navizian\u2019s hand on her back.\nShe said, \u201cSo you stretched the filigree back in time. He knew about his death a day and a third before he would have otherwise. But to do that, he must have agreed to the experiment after the filigree originally appeared. In essence, you rewrote his past.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Loevler said. \u201cAnd his future.\u201d\n\u201cWhat were the risks? I\u2019m assuming he wasn\u2019t the first.\u201d\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t. He suffered partial brain damage. In fact, if we revived him now, he probably wouldn\u2019t be able to follow a game of checkers. Or to spell his own name, for that matter. His body would shut down.\u201d\n\u201cIt looks like I\u2019m in for a world of fun,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cBut then again, I guess I should be grateful. Not much of a speller, and never did like checkers.\u201d\nNavizian said, \u201cWe\u2019ve improved the technique, Sarah. The risks should be minimal to you. We can retroproject your filigree a lot farther back in time, and you can choose to live as you wish.\u201d\n\u201cWill I remember any of this?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Navizian said. \u201cIt will be confusing for you, at first. But then you\u2019ll learn to think of everything that\u2019s happening as a kind of dream, or the memory of another life perhaps.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the filigree? Wouldn\u2019t it be pointless, then?\u201d\n\u201cNot necessarily. You could choose to act normally, in which case you would still die at the predetermined time, or you could alter your behavior, and the number would be meaningless.\u201d\n\u201cThe choice seems pretty obvious to me.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised,\u201d Loevler said. \u201cMany of the earlier trial runs failed because once the subject had the option to live or die, they decided to die. Nothing in our predictive curve indicated that kind of leap. Something about not messing with God\u2019s intended purpose, I suppose. There\u2019s no accounting for taste.\u201d\n\u201cI guess some simply feel it makes sense to follow God\u2019s will, since we can\u2019t all play at being God,\u201d Sarah said.\nLoevler was unfazed. \u201cA few of us can, and very successfully. Navizian assures me you are trustworthy, and his word is enough for me. The only reason I\u2019ve humored you this long is because Nav seemed to think you\u2019d be a good girl.\u201d He intoned the word \u2018girl\u2019 the same way he had said \u2018man\u2019 when referring to Michael.\nNevertheless, something about the comatose man compelled Sarah. He was handsome, in a sort of rugged way, and more peaceful than anyone she had ever seen. His lips were slightly drawn, not so much in a smile but in a kind of eternal sigh. She knew it was all fake, of course, the illusion of serenity conjured by nanoregulators busily at work inside the man\u2019s body. But that didn\u2019t matter.\nShe examined the data again.\nA jolt of optimism overcame her.\n\u201cReady when you are,\u201d she said.\nIf the procedure was successful, she might even have the chance to forget she\u2019d ever met Loevler.\n#\nNavizian saw to it that the assistants handled her with at least a modicum of dignity. They dumped nanos into her bloodstream, irradiated her with particles whose name she found unpronounceable, and subjected her to equally tongue-tripping fields. With a tinge of regret, Sarah realized that by dropping physics in high school she\u2019d passed up the chance to learn a lot of abstruse words, though her chosen field of stochastic art had offered its own share of rewarding nomenclature.\nBy turns she felt queasy, light-headed, feverish, and finally depleted. If there were any more procedures, she thought morbidly, their means of escaping causality might simply be to exhaust her to death.\nLoevler now made a brief reappearance. Her head still spun from the treatments, and the sight of him added a new type of throbbing to her temples.\n\u201cYou may experience some disorientation and discomfort as we begin the actual procedure,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the last two hours technicians have been calibrating your responses to different immersions. Now that they understand your tolerance levels, we can begin in earnest.\u201d\n\u201cYour sense of humor is as endearing as your needles.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not joking,\u201d Navizian said. \u201cWe needed to keep you motivated. We want this to be a success, after all, as much as you do.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe more,\u201d she said.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\u201cMy migraine means that.\u201d\nNavizian had them dispense medication to ease the pain.\n\u201cWould you like to be awake during the process?\u201d Loevler asked. \u201cIt could prove to be quite an experience.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s how you described your visits to the dentist when you were a kid. To hell with it. Knock me out.\u201d\nThe world became soft and fluid, and she fell into a caramel dream.\n#\nSarah\u2019s eyelids fluttered frantically, trying to adjust to the torrential white light before her. But there was no adjusting, so she shut them as hard as she could, until pain shot down her forehead and formed a grimace.\nAnd then she was stepping out of the light, into a vast, padded chamber. Rows upon rows of listless humans sat on dull ochre chairs, some slouching, some erect. They were all filigreed.\nShe stumbled upon a mechanical orderly, which attempted to feed her a gooey mush, no doubt laced with tranquilizers.\nOne of the women near her seemed to be more conscious than the rest, and Sarah shook her shoulders.\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d she demanded. \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d\nThe woman had probably not spoken in years, for her lips quivered in an effort to produce cracked syllables. \u201cWe\u2019re here \u2026 because there\u2019s nowhere else to go. Time is running out.\u201d\nSarah focused on the woman\u2019s filigree. Tendrils of light shaped scintillating numbers in the air. Five years, four months, eighteen days, six hours, twenty-five minutes, ten seconds. Nine seconds. Eight. Seven.\nShe looked up at her own filigree.\nIt was an unwavering zero.\nThe light returned.\n#\nShe woke up on a soft bed with dim lights overhead.\n\u201cNavi?\u201d She struggled to call out the name clearly, but rasped a forced whisper.\nTried again. \u201cNavizian?\u201d Silence.\nShe sat up. She was alone in a lab.\nShe remembered something. An experiment.\nMaybe she was it. Well, if it had been a success, she would have expected someone to greet her.\nIf it had been a failure, she might be dead, and this could be the afterlife. But her lab robe was moist with sweat, and she could still smell some of the chemicals they had applied to her skin, which made it seem unlikely she\u2019d traveled into the next world.\nShe padded around the lab and discovered automated systems still running and terminals left abandoned in the middle of analyses.\nThe dim lights must be emergency power.\nThe soft hum of the air circulators made her want to scream.\nAs she walked around she noticed her head still bothered her, though not as much as before. She glimpsed the reflection of her filigree on several screens. Time \u2026 is running out. Instantly she recalled her dream, and at once found coruscating numbers.\nTwenty years, eight months, nine days, seven hours, forty three minutes and twenty eight seconds. Her mind was still somewhat numb by events, but intuitively she seemed to understand that those numbers were probably devoid of significance. If not, the oppressiveness of that knowledge was unthinkable.\nShe tried to recall what time it had been before going under, but it was no use.\nFoggy images drifted through her mind. The sun going down, water falling.\nSomething must have happened to draw everyone away from here. Navizian must be involved, and he would have the answers. He always did.\nShe wandered down several corridors and then had the brilliant idea of engaging the facility\u2019s intercom system.\nShe heard her voice resound across halls, around corners.\nA few minutes later a man in uniform approached her. He seemed to be a security guard. He shuffled the bulk of his body. Maybe he was just starting to become acquainted with his own filigree, the numbers of which she paid little attention to.\n\u201cAre you looking for someone?\u201d\nHis tone was gruff, his eyes embedded in furrowed skin. Suspicion rippled through him but his hands remained at his sides. Her appearance could have been so bewildering that he was hesitant to detain her. She might be alive, but from the little she\u2019d seen of herself in the lab she would probably look dandier in a casket.\n\u201cHave you seen Navizian?\u201d\nHe shook his head.\nA name arrived on her tongue, and she allowed it life. \u201cLoevler?\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t reply.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Navizian\u2019s office? I\u2019m assuming he had one. Has one.\u201d\nProducing detailed, tangible information seemed to put the guard\u2019s mind at ease.\nShe found the room, two floors above and three subsections over. On her way she encountered two others, both of them filigreed. One seemed to be the man in the coma, now very much alive.\nThe office was locked.\nShe knocked, feeling silly.\nNavizian and his floating filigree opened it.\n#\nSarah was taken aback by Navi\u2019s hug. Even when they hadn\u2019t seen one another for months, he had never volunteered this kind of emotion. Knowing that she was filigreed, he had offered a handshake.\nThis embrace was surprising for its immediacy and for the suddenness of its cessation. Navizian took some steps back and leaned on a wall, peering out across a nightgram. Interwoven pearls of light from his filigree reflected impossibly against what should have been the depths of night.\nHe had years left. Patiently, she waited for an explanation.\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here,\u201d was all he managed.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad too,\u201d she said, not understanding what he meant.\nShe sat down on a leather couch. He went over some of the details of events leading up to now. Then he continued, \u201cWe triumphed. Loevler beat the odds. You were the first. What you and I remember didn\u2019t actually take place, since we\u2019ve changed the past. We retroprojected your filigree three days in the past, and you contacted me so I could keep you safe. But meddling with the timeline has had unexpected side-effects. Your survival is a pivot. That single event has set in motion a causality that will create new technology in the future. Maybe you\u2019ll develop it. Technology which will be used to retroproject filigrees for all of humanity to today\u2019s date. So now we all have them.\u201d\nHis words were spectral, his stance forlorn.\n\u201cBut if we\u2019ve altered the past, then how can the numbers indicate anything real?\u201d Sarah found her voice rising in a mixture of exhilaration and dread. \u201cWe\u2019re free to do anything, to change the future.\u201d\nHis silence was a brooding response.\n\u201cWell?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe we are,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my work is done. I\u2019ve always thought of myself as essentially immortal. But there\u2019s no escape anymore. I can\u2019t live like this, with those seconds counting down. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s not real. It\u2019s real to me. I\u2019d never be able to sleep at night.\u201d\nSomething terminal floated across his eyes, an eclipse.\nWhen she\u2019d turned down his marriage proposal years ago his face had looked similar. Maybe more lively.\nHe pointed to a blister of capsules on his workstation desk. Some were missing.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d she said.\nShe was too exhausted to cry, too furious to want to.\n\u201cYou saved me,\u201d she said. \u201cYou saved all of us. What about yourself?\u201d\nHe smiled, but there was little gentleness to it.\nSurprising herself at the vividness of her recollection, she brought forth the taste of his kiss, a kiss that would never be again. He had seen her need on Makuzo\u2019s falls and suggested something. Again, she had declined. She had failed to see his own need.\n\u201cLoevler sent me a picture of he and Michael,\u201d he said, almost as an afterthought.\nHe sat on the couch.\n\u201cHold my hand,\u201d he said.\nShe reached out.\n#\nSarah stared at the people twenty stories below. She studied a couple window-shopping across the street, their floating filigrees reflected in the pane. First, they held hands. Then the woman tugged at the man\u2019s arm, and after some uncertain resistance he gave in. Who had time for window-shopping?\nMany people simply wouldn\u2019t be able to cope. It didn\u2019t matter that causality was broken, that the filigrees were meaningless. People had been marked, assigned a number, a time, and that in itself had been enough to shake their sense of purpose. A half-formed recollection of apathetic dopers in a cavernous hall tightened her stomach, and tears swelled when she thought of the price she had unwittingly exacted on the world, on a dear friend.\nShe fought off the misery.\nThere were always options. The filigree would never leave, but you could ignore the numbers.\nYou could go on, and more.\nDeath could not be vanquished, only lived with.\nFor their own inscrutable reasons, the beings above were trying to help: one day, to make things tidy. Knowing something was better than knowing nothing. But knowing everything, she realized, was impossible, for it simply led back to knowing nothing.\nShe still had time to learn.\nAlvaro is an aspiring SF writer with a background in theoretical physics and creative writing.

He wished he could construct a properly vilifying arrow of rebuke to shoot at the whimpering cad who sat on the other side of his desk. An arrow whose tip he might have dipped in the rankest dung before he nocked it.\nThe client, George Conklin, patted his eyes with a soggy handkerchief. \"She was the love of my life. My true soul mate. Over the last few weeks, I've come to realize that. I've been so empty, so lost. Oh, to see Maria walk through that door, alive and whole again! Then I can spend the rest of my life making amends to her . . .\"\n\"And so we shall soon make you whole, just as we made her whole, Mr. Conklin.\" Undoubtedly so, he thought in disgust. He jabbed an icon on his touch-screen display and caused the Atonement Act documents to appear on the client-side monitor. \"As well as making you fully expiated. Please approve this closing paperwork for the Clerk of Court.\"\nGeorge held his wrist out and gave a quick series of thumb-to- finger taps to kinesthetically trigger his embed's approval code transmission. \"Only four days to spare before the Court-imposed deadline. Cutting it kind of close there, weren't you?\"\n\"The head trauma was severe,\" the technician said. \"The shotgun wound had essentially taken out her entire cranium. We had to access all the way down to level three data from her last Quantum Tomogram. An inordinate amount of nano-knitting had to be done inside Maria's new skull. You know . . . it would have been more thoughtful to everyone involved if you'd used a smaller caliber weapon.\"\nGeorge sniffed and wiped his nose in reply.\n\"And now if you'll kindly acknowledge fund transfers for the fees and Court fines, and authorize the obligatory post-reanimation care file stream to your embed, we'll bring her on out.\" The wages of George's sin transmuted themselves into cold, hard pixels on his monitor.\nThe technician watched George wince slightly as he again tapped out his kinesthetic code, this time much more slowly. \"Just remember that Maria will need time to catch up with things. She'll only recall events leading up to her last government-authorized QT, which was seven years ago.\"\n\"Ah, our joint pre-marital QT scan. I still remember it fondly. Did I tell you how much in love we were?\"\n\"Right. Well, as I was saying, Mr. Conklin. You'll need to be patient and understanding while she readjusts to the present. And please be watchful for odd behavioral changes. Ah, here she is now . . .\"\nMaria walked slowly and unsteadily into the office, helped by another technician. George stood and she smiled brightly at him from across the room. \"Darling!\" she said. He ran to her, and they embraced tightly. Both blubbered and simpered and cooed unintelligible things to each other as they left the office, arm in arm.\nThe technician sighed and closed the Conklin case e-file.

Arranged chronologically in neat interspersed turns, one spouse after the other. If the pattern held, he'd be seeing Maria sitting here in about six months, give or take, with her own Court Order to reanimate George.\nIt would be too much to hope, he thought, that they could ever manage to murder each other simultaneously.\nGary Cuba lives with his wife and a continuously fluctuating number of dogs and cats near the Congaree National Swamp in South Carolina.

Mr. Grant, this is Kumiko Masaharu, whom I'm sure you know as our featured soloist this evening.\u201d\nWhat a clich\u00e9, Kumiko thought, as though someone had combined a twenty and a fifty to come up with his blue-blooded name. No doubt his rich parentage had bequeathed it to him along with the family fortune. She had been learning much about this ubiquitous component known as currency as of late. Not a necessity to her survival, of course, but indispensable to the human condition as she understood it. And this captain of industry reeked of it. All the way from his stylish gray hair to his manicured nails, his finely tailored dark suit defining his affluence. As she took his paper-dry hand in her tiny one, she noticed his wedding band.\n\u201cI am delighted to meet you,\u201d Jackson Grant said. \u201cAnd let me say that your performance this evening was lovely.\u201d And what came out of his mouth next was almost verbatim with what her own mind supplied: \u201cAnd such a huge talent for someone so young. The term prodigy certainly applies to you.\u201d Well, at least the prodigy part was unique. Though on just about every city on the tour, she'd heard something similar. At least Grant had been cultivated enough not to call her \u201csuch a pretty young thing.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, thank you, sir,\u201d she replied. \u201cSince I've been in your country I've heard nothing but kind words, but yours are the most ... how would you say it ... debonair?\u201d She was getting quite good at the broken-English routine; the high lilt and slight slur that actually sounded Asian. Despite her near-perfect Japanese physique, she'd been about as close to that island world as Jackson Grant had been to living in a homeless shelter, though she had caught a glimpse of that comma-splash of a country on her Earthly descent.\nBertram Simms, who had conducted the Metropolitan Philharmonic that evening, said, \u201cThough this is Kumiko's first visit to America, she speaks English quite well, don't you agree, Mr. Grant?\u201d\nGrant raised his wine flute. \u201cYes, exceedingly well. And it's a good thing, as I don't speak a word of Japanese.\u201d He offered a mild chuckle, and leered down at her with his perfect million-dollar smile\u2014all caps of course.\nGood, thought Kumiko, because outside of knowing \u201csayonara,\u201d neither did she. Though she supposed she could pick it up as easily as she had English, or the ability to play Tchaikovsky's Concerto in D major for violin. And as luck would have it, \u201csayonara\u201d soon sprang from her lips as she was able to leave the conductor to his auxiliary function of fundraising and escape the philanthropist's leer.\nIn the dressing room backstage, she shed her strapless soign\u00e9 gown and donned the new street gear she'd picked up earlier that day: tight jeans in the latest fashion, a sleek tank top, and pink stilettos. Though the stilettos added a couple of inches to her height, she nudged her metabolism and added a couple more, mostly in her legs which were on the stubby side. Closer inspection in the mirror made her augment her breasts as well. She'd seen the way that millionaire philanthropist had lusted after her, as though she were his adopted teenaged daughter from the orient, all of thirteen. Well, she didn't look thirteen now. To top if off, she grabbed a pair of scissors from her bag. Her shoulder-length raven mane was about to go.\nMoments later she exited the concert hall, preened, attenuated and spiked. Hard to believe that some people spent months in school to learn this coiffeur thing. Hard to believe a lot of things about these beings. These human beings. But tonight she was going to mingle with them \u201cdown and dirty,\u201d as she'd heard it called. Though on assignment, there was no reason why she couldn't have a little fun while fulfilling Routeur-ra's objectives. Running her hand once again across her dark porcupined hair\u2014it tickled her palm amusingly\u2014she stepped to the curb and stuck out her thumb.\nThe first four cars that pulled over were all men with only one thing on their feeble minds. Not that she wouldn't, perhaps, be game for this fucking thing at some point in time, but the men's sole motivation was so predictable. (Yes, so far she'd learned that if currency was the first all-important commodity on this world, then fornication was the second. Odd, since her kind had evolved past both eons ago.)\n\u201cWhat's your fucking problem, bitch?\u201d a guy in the last car hollered at her. \u201cI'm willing to pay.\u201d\n\u201cI said, no thank you,\u201d she told the man. And apparently both commodities were often intertwined. Opposite sides of a similar coin.\nThe fifth car to pull over contained a lone black female appareled somewhat as Kumiko was. Well, the stilettos were nearly identical. Having a good feeling about this one, she hopped in. The woman was dressed in a slinky red dress, and her hair was long and dyed platinum, which was quite striking in contrast with her ebony skin.\n\u201cHi, honey,\u201d the black hooker said. \u201cThey call me Peach 'cause I'm so, so sweet. You gotta name?\u201d\n\u201cKumiko,\u201d she replied. Since everything else about her was invented, she didn't see the need in adopting a plethora of pseudonyms. Dropping the pigeon-English routine, she trash-talked: \u201cSo, you partying 'round here tonight?\u201d The lingo felt right, anyway, an amalgam from a couple of cop shows she'd caught on the hotel's TV, and two prostitutes she'd overheard from the local \u201cwelcoming committee\u201d gabbing in the ladies' room at O'Hare International last week.\n\u201cI don't really solo on the streets no more, if that's whatcha mean,\u201d Peach said. \u201cI gots me a pimp. Yeah, I know what you're thinkin', that alls they do is take yo' money, but Big Willie's different. Willie's got blow, and he don't hang it over yo' head all night long, if ya know what I mean. If a girl wants to party, then Big Willie'll share his Peruvian pile. You do like flake, don'tcha?\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Kumiko said, figuring she was referring to cocaine; more cop shows. She'd never tried it, of course, but the night was still young. She'd try anything once, twice if Routeur-ra disapproved. Hell, it had to be more fun than performing in front of a bunch of staid culture vultures night after night, though that had been enjoyable at first. Which made her remember that she'd left her $8000 Stradivarius copy behind. Oh, that was no big deal, but if she would've thought to bring it, she might have been able to use it as barter for some of this Peruvian pile Peach was referring to. Though she doubted if this pandering fellow, Big Willie the Pimp, would appreciate its fine though faux craftsmanship. And she probably should hang on to the Stradivarius, as she did have another concert on the tour in a couple of days, if she decided to attend.\n\u201cIs this your automobile?\u201d Kumiko asked, running her hand across the fake fur on the Cadillac's dash. Cool jazz fluttered about the roomy car, a whimsical saxophone taking flight.\n\u201cHell, no,\u201d Peach said, giving her new companion a quizzical look. \u201cThis is Big Willie's ride. He just let's me borrow it from time to\u2014Hey, you ever done this befo'? You look awful young, which be a plus as you prolly know, but you look\u2014\u201d She stared at Kumiko through heavily mascaraed eyes, crinkled her brow. \u201cYou ever done this befo'?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, I have,\u201d Kumiko replied. \u201cI can climb the highest Peruvian pile you or Willie or anyone can pile up.\u201d She injected annoyance into her voice, hoping she had the tone right and the lingo pat. She was beginning to like this Sweet Peach person and wanted to impress her.\n\u201cNo, I ain't talkin' 'bout that, honey. I'm talkin' 'bout ...\u201d Peach sighed, but then smiled as she regarded Kumiko. Amber light from a passing storefront reflected off her oversized teeth and the whites of her eyes to light up the Caddy's interior. \u201cDon't worry. Yo' pretty. Willie'll like that. But the way, you Chinese or what?\u201d\n\u201cI'm Japanese,\u201d she said with a superior tone.\nAgain the interior lit with Peach's smile. \u201cEven better. He already has a Chinese girl who works outta her apartment. Like I said, Big Willie's a great guy. Though every now and again he'll get in one of his moods and pimp you out for a twenty spot just to insult ya.\u201d\n\u201cAn Andrew Jackson?\u201d Kumiko said, raising both eyebrows.\nPeach frowned, then nodded. \u201cIf that's who's on a twenty. Yeah, one of them white dudes. Girl, you act like youse gotta education or somethin'.\u201d\n\u201cI watch a lot of TV in hotel rooms.\u201d\n\u201cHoney, in hotel rooms we don't usually have time for TV,\u201d she said and laughed. Peach was quite the talker and kept prattling nonstop until they arrived at Big Willie's place, a combo bordello, outcall service, and crack shack for a discriminating few. Mostly it was outcalls, Peach said. And that Willie, because he \u201ccared\u201d about his girls, never let them freebase or rock the stuff up, though he might occasionally be \u201con the pipe\u201d himself. But there was nothing wrong with a little toot in his pimp's playbook.\n\u201cSweet Peach!\u201d he cried, raising his big arms high in the air. Though he wasn't looking at the sanguine-skirted hooker at all. \u201cWhat did you bring me?\u201d\n\u201cWillie, this here's Kumiko. Found her thumbin' down on Commerce.\u201d\n\u201cWell, hellooo Kumikooo,\u201d he said, affecting a hint of the orient in his lilting delivery. If Peach's pearly-white illumination was bright in Willie's ride, it was nothing compared to the brilliance the huge, blacker-than-midnight-in-Zimbabwe pimp's grin radiated. He made the young ingenue quite welcome.\nBy street standards it was still early, just a little after ten, and soon Big Willie's fillies began to arrive. Unfortunately, so far that evening Willie's cell phone had been on the reticent side.\n\u201cWhy don'tcha break out and make a pile, Willie,\u201d Claudia, a mulatto hooker with a glass eye and an unbelievable mountain of orange hair, prompted.\n\u201cDo that, Willie-baby,\u201d said Rose, a skinny white chick with an overbite. Though the Pancake covered her acne-ripe cheeks fairly well, nothing could mask the hunger in her watery eyes. \u201cThat way when yo' cell starts beepin', yo' bitches'll be in the mood.\u201d Kumiko got the feeling that Rose was only imitating the king in his castle here, but Big Willie didn't seem to mind.\n\u201cMy bitches better be in the mood,\u201d he cautioned, \u201cbut I s'pose I could break out a teenager.\u201d\n\u201cA teenager?\u201d Kumiko asked Peach.\n\u201cA sixteenth of an oh-zee,\u201d she replied. \u201cHalf an eight ball. Girl, where you been livin'?\u201d\nKumiko didn't answer, but did take the proffered line when it came her turn. She really didn't see what the fuss was all about. Yeah, she felt a little something, but it wore off quickly. Probably her unique metabolism, she decided, because the other girls seemed to be having a grand time, chatting, prancing around while sniffling and grinning ear to ear. That was until the small pile Willie had laid out for the four of them had disappeared up an octet of nostrils. Soon after that happened Claudia was down on her knees, her hands fawning all over Willie, who kept brushing her away. \u201cYou'll get some mo' after you earn it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd not a moment befo'.\u201d\n\u201cOh, come on, Willie,\u201d Rose pleaded. \u201cBe a friend.\u201d\n\u201cIt's like this every night,\u201d Peach whispered to Kumiko from their vantage point nearby. Big Willie was reclining in his big easy chair where, cell phone in hand, he ran his postage-stamp-sized empire.\nFinally, Willie had had enough. \u201cOkay, you bitches want some mo' blow? All right, I'll make yas another pile. Now, who want's to play Prussian roulette?\u201d\n\u201cBut it's not like that every night,\u201d Peach said to Kumiko. To her pimp: \u201cWillie, don't. Please, forget it. You know what happened last time ...\u201d\nAll eyes fell on Claudia. \u201cYeah, I was in the hospital for days.\u201d She frowned, but then her mulatto brow unfurled and she smiled. \u201cWhich means it's somebody else's turn.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I'm certainly not gonna do it,\u201d Rose said. \u201cI mean, of course I'll give you some head, Willie, but no more Prussian roulette.\u201d Watery eyes darted about nervously.\nBut while they were arguing, Willie dipped into his stash and pulled out two teenagers this time, a full eight ball, and piled it on the smooth jet-black tabletop stand to the side of his easy chair. Next to it he laid his pearl-handled revolver and grinned wickedly. \u201cCome on, Claudia. Big Willie wants yo' sweet lips.\u201d\nAt that, Claudia lost it and pulled off the orange mountain which Kumiko never doubted was a wig. She was basically bald, only a tiny dark fuzz present. On the side of her pate was a gash where a chunk of her skull was missing. A small chunk, but missing nonetheless. She pointed to the cavity, ire in her good eye that seemed to carry over to her glass one. \u201cSo you can do this to me again?\u201d she squawked. \u201cI don't think so.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not let the new girl give it a try?\u201d Rose said. It was obvious all she wanted was her little side of the tiny white mountain Willie had piled up before them, and she didn't care how she got it.\nAll eyes fell on Kumiko.\n\u201cYeah, why not?\u201d said Claudia, reapplying her orange mania.\nWillie smiled. \u201cWhat'd you think, sweetstuff? Best way in the world to be 'doctrinated into Big Willie's stable. To become one of my prize bitches.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Peach said. \u201cPlease, Willie, don't.\u201d To Kumiko she whispered, \u201cHoney, you don't wanna do this.\u201d\nBut that wasn't entirely true. Kumiko had been standing there for three-quarters of an hour now, observing. True, this was what Routeur-ra had instructed her to do. Her task in general was to observe, to reconnoiter this world\u2014but perhaps it was time she stopped being an observer and became an active participant. And besides, this Big Willie wasn't so much of a pimp as he was a wimp, she figured, hiding behind his gun and his Peruvian flake. Perhaps it was time someone\u2014\n\u201cSo, what do I have to do?\u201d she asked.\nUnzipping his suede pimp-pants, Willie beckoned her near. \u201cOn your knees, my fine newest bitch. Time to find out why they call Big Willie Big Willie.\u201d He chuckled.\nThe last thing Kumiko saw before tucking her head down to take care of business was his million-dollar smile. Or a smile worth at least a few grand, she figured. Not any excessive grillwork there, but he did sport a fair amount of gold. So this is giving head, Kumiko thought as she took him in her mouth. This fellatio thing. Sometimes she thought she'd be lost if not for the television in her hotel room, this one practice gleaned from a cable channel in Milwaukee that she'd quickly learned wasn't part of the standard network fare. Pornography, it was called. Most interesting.\nWillie's member had an odd pungent taste about it, a medley of dried perspiration, old soap not cleansed away properly, and something else. An odd savor, yes, the image of a black stallion came to mind. He'd probably like that, she realized. But what had at first not been an unpleasant experience, was quickly becoming a chore as Willie rose to the occasion. Kumiko had such a tiny mouth and Big Willie was so . . .\n\u201cHarder. Harder,\u201d he told her. And then she felt the barrel of his revolver press against her temple, heard an ominous click as the hammer was cocked back. \u201cStep back from the pile, Rose,\u201d he told the skinny hooker. \u201cAnd how do you even know Kumiko here's gonna wanna share withcha?\u201d\n\u201c'Cause that's how it's done,\u201d Rose said. \u201cThe sucker always shares.\u201d\n\u201cThat don't mean she has to,\u201d Claudia put in. \u201cThough I imagine if ya ask her nicely ...\u201d\n\u201cWillie, don't ya think you got the barrel pointed a little too much into her head?\u201d This from a concerned Peach.\nKumiko heard a click as Big Willie pulled the trigger and the hammer came down on a empty chamber. From above and behind, Kumiko heard a sharp intake of breath and then a couple of sighs.\n\u201cWeren't no bullet in that chamber anyway,\u201d he said, as he raised the revolver and spun the cylinder.\nAh yes, she thought, the roulette aspect. Like a casino game in Las Vegas. Funny, Las Vegas wasn't one of the cities on her concert tour. Perhaps there Tchaikovsky wasn't\u2014\n\u201cThis one I ain't so sure about,\u201d he furthered, then laughed and placed the barrel back to her head. Not directly at her temple this time, but resting against her pate. Willie may have been reckless, but he wasn't stupid. He had no intention of killing her, Kumiko realized. To him, she represented money, making her both sides of that all-important coin so often tendered in the human equation. Also, this time he probably didn't know whether the lone bullet was in a deadly position or not.\n\u201cYou forgot to add to our pile,\u201d Rose said.\n\u201cKumiko's pile,\u201d Peach reminded her.\n\u201cI'm sure she'll share,\u201d Claudia said. \u201cWon't you, Kumiko?\u201d\n\u201cShut up, bitch,\u201d Willie said. \u201cCan't you see she's busy now and can't talk?\u201d\nBut Kumiko could hear some light tapping sounds as Willie built upon tiny Mount Peru. He then spun the cylinder again, put the barrel to her pate and fired. Another empty chamber since only a click ensued. Though there was no way of being absolutely sure, a small mathematical part of Kumiko's brain had told her that chamber would be empty. That, and her keen ear that could actually hear each click of the spinning cylinder. Yes, this was much like Las Vegas, only the stakes were higher.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Rose cried with enthusiasm. \u201cKumiko's pile keeps getting bigger and bigger.\u201d And that it was. Kumiko hadn't seen it yet, but she was sure her efforts were producing quite the little narcotic knoll.\n\u201cDon't you think she's had enough, Willie?\u201d Peach asked after the next blank chamber was determined with a click and another teenager added to the pile. Kumiko had to agree; her jaw was getting tired.\n\u201cOne more time,\u201d he said, and spun the cylinder. But this time Kumiko could tell that her number had come up. Unless she'd miscounted the clicks, the bullet was aligned with the chamber and this time the hammer would fire the round. Well, Big Willie had had his fun long enough, she decided. Now it was her turn. So when he placed the barrel against the top of her skull, she reacted in concert. With her right hand she reached up and relocated the barrel against her temple, while at the same time she razored her teeth to a sharp blade and bit down. Hard!\nAs the gun went off, Kumiko stood. Writhing in his easy chair, Big Willie screamed, his cries joined by Claudia's hysterical wailing. Rose merely stood there in shock. Then Peach came up beside Kumiko. \u201cGirl,\u201d she said, astonishment in her voice, \"there be a hole in yo' head.\u201d Peach's eyes widened even further as Kumiko willed the opening in her temple to close. Kumiko then spit Big Willie's penis out into his bloody lap, and worked her tongue around inside her mouth. Within a moment she had the bullet between her teeth, then held it up. \u201cIs this yours, Willie-san?\u201d she said in her mock-Japanese accent, then giggled.\nWillie was still screaming, seething with pain, but he managed to get out, \u201cWhy you do this to me, bitch? Why? Why?\u201d But there was no arrogance in him now, as Big Willie had lost a few inches of his pride.\n\u201cGirlfriend,\u201d Sweet Peach said, \u201cI've seen lots of strange shit in my life, but that's. . .\n\u201cThat's just weird,\u201d Claudia finished.\n\u201cI'll say, but ...\u201d Rose said with a raised eyebrow above that hungry look.\nWhich prompted Kumiko to share her little slice of Peru with the girls. Claudia was kind enough to razor-blade out the lines, while Big Willie lay in his easy chair, whimpering, bleeding profusely, using his big hands to try to stanch the flow. He begged them to come to his aid, but they politely ignored him. Yes, eventually the paramedics were called, but Peach and Kumiko left before they arrived. As did Claudia and Rose, who had helped themselves to Willie's stash of dope and cash. Cops usually came with the paramedics, and this was one best left to Big Willie to explain.\n\u201cHey, be careful,\u201d Peach groused at the cop who pushed her into the cell. Kumiko had already entered and staked out a spot on the cold, hard floor. Because it was a holding cell, there was nothing in it except a metal sink and a toilet. The door slid shut with finality.\n\u201cWell, this is just fuckin' great,\u201d Peach muttered.\n\u201cHave you ever been in prison before?\u201d Kumiko asked.\n\u201cNo, and this ain't prison, child. This is just an overnight stay in this squirrelly city's idea of lockup. Don't worry, we can make bail tomorrow. Normally, Big Willie would have me out in a couple of hours, but seeing as you went an bit his dong off.\u201d She chuckled. \u201cGirl, I thought I'd seen it all.\u201d She went to the wall opposite Kumiko and sat down on the floor facing her. A slow night, it was just the two of them.\nThey had Peach double-booked on charges. She'd shoplifted a box of tampons at the 7-Eleven and Willie had reported his Caddy stolen. Peach matched the description of the woman in 7-Eleven they'd stopped at, but the only thing they had Kumiko on was no I D. It was probably with her Stradivarius, she figured, which she found amusing since both were as authentic as her Japanese heritage.\nThe two of them sat there chatting aimlessly until Peach submerged and Routeur-ra animated the hooker's physique. After taking a moment to marvel at his lithe fingers and ebony skin, her superior said, \u201cThis is not what we had in mind, Dara-da, and you know it.\u201d\nShe shot him a bitter scowl. \u201cYou wanted me to reconnoiter this world. Well, I'm reconnoitering.\u201d\n\u201cHow, by allowing yourself to be incarcerated? I don't see where this aids your mission at all. I do admit the role of concert violinist has run its course, but I don't see where spending the evening with a pandering pharmacologist and his courtesans is all that enlightening.\u201d\nKumiko had to laugh at that. Pandering pharmacologist ...? She was immersed in the culture enough now to find that funny. \u201cYou mean drug-dealing pimp and his hookers.\u201d\n\u201cNow don't get insolent with me.\u201d Peach's eyes flared for a moment as back on the homeworld Demigod Routeur-ra's ire raised, but something must have happened to the connection because Peach started giggling, then said, \u201cGirl, I thought I'd seen it all, but the way you bit off Big Willie's ...\u201d She shook her head and grinned.\nAbout a half hour after they brought Peach back from questioning, an officer, a woman this time, said, \u201cKumiko Masaharu,\u201d and ushered her from the cell. When questioned, Peach had told the authorities that Kumiko had nothing to do with any of it, so soon Kumiko found herself cut loose and back on the streets. It was just a little after two A.M.\nBecause it was a weeknight, the streets were nearly dead. The only people out were those few up to no good, the rougher element. Funny, now Kumiko felt like she was a part of the down and dirty. Truly one of them. As much a part of it as she'd felt toward the symphony crowd. But still it was all so weird. These beings of the human variety ... so different from her kind. It amazed her how they could have evolved in the first place, climbing from the seas eons ago, learning to walk upright, making simple tools at first, and then more complex ones later like Prussian revolvers and Stradivariuses. Amazing how they could break off into splinter groups, some of them addicted to narcotics, while others became captains of industry. It wasn't like where she emanated from. Where she came from there was order and discipline and purpose to one's own perpetual existence. And always there was Routeur-ra. The transubstantiated godthing of the hierarchical flow. And this bothered her. How was she to report to him her true findings? That despite these humans' ability to wreak havoc with every turn they made, they had discovered something her kind severely lacked: spontaneity. On Earth it flourished in abundance. On her world there was no name for such a thing, the closest designation being \u201ccreativity,\u201d a concept no longer practiced or allowed.\nAs she passed a garbage-strewn alleyway, she heard a moan. An animal dying ...? Common sense told her to continue on. She recognized this area from when Bertram Simms the conductor had picked her up at the hotel and taken her to the concert hall. She was headed in the right direction. But something made her stop and venture into the alley.\nAnd that was where she found him. Half covered in old newspapers, lay a beleaguered old man. Bewhiskered, sallow of complexion, it was apparent he was desperately ill with perhaps only moments to live. Death? Kumiko had heard of it, but was unsure of it particulars, its dynamics. She had to learn more.\nShe sat down beside him and wrapped her arms around him the best she could. No, she was not telepathic, nor really even empathic, but the old derelict was radiating a history as forceful as the sour whiskey reeking on his last few breaths. Though only vague sensations, she could tell he'd been prosperous once. Not a captain of industry or a Big Willie-type, but someone with a family and a business, before the latter fell on hard times and he'd lost everything. Now he was just a wasted shell. As he sat there and groaned, coughing, probably not even aware Kumiko sat beside him, she felt the life force leaving his body. And when it finally had, she stood and realized that a tear had sprung from her left eye. She had tried to invoke them before, but with no success. Now she thought she understood a little better.\nAs she found herself walking back down the boulevard, she wiped her eyes and forced her hair to grow back to shoulder length. It was late and about time to find the concert hall and resume her old life. Of course, the place would be locked up tight, but that wouldn't stop her. Same as the holding cell wouldn't have held her if she'd decided to leave before being released. But as of late, she'd been learning patience.\nLost in thought, she glanced up to see that a car had pulled up beside her and the electric window in the rear was rolling down. And not just any car\u2014a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce with a purr so fine it was barely audible. \u201cHi,\u201d a well-dressed man said in back. \u201cI was wondering ...\u201d\nKumiko stopped and looked in. He looked harmless enough so she did more than just look, she hopped in. It was too early to call it a night, and there was still more reconnoitering to be done.\n\u201cHey, don't I know you?\u201d the man said.\nYes, he did. It was Jackson Grant, the captain of industry from earlier. Not wanting to be bothered with explanation, Kumiko altered the shape of her face slightly, making her cheeks a little puffier, her chin a little longer. \u201cWould you like to know me?\u201d she asked in broken English and gave him a wink.\n\u201cOh, I'm sorry, at first you looked very much like a young lady I met earlier,\u201d Grant said. \u201cBut that's no matter.\u201d He took a moment to let his eyes stroll up and down her form. \u201cMy, you're out awfully late.\u201d\n\u201cSo are you. So what would you like to do?\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cI don't know. A little bit of everything, I guess. I'd like to talk for a while first, if you don't mind. Would you like a drink?\u201d\n\u201cSure, what do you have?\u201d\nThe discreet chauffeur didn't need to be told to raise the one-way glass separating the two compartments, and Grant offered her a brandy. At least that's what he called it as he handed her the snifter. It had a warm, mellow savor and Kumiko could tell that the millionaire had already had a few. Had he been driving around for the last few hour, alone like this? Noticing his wedding band again, she had to ask, \u201cSo, your wife isn't much of a talker?\u201d Instantly she knew it was the wrong thing to say, but she was new at this tricking thing.\n\u201cMy wife's dead,\u201d Grant said, eyes on the dark liquor in his glass. At length, he furthered, \u201cOvarian cancer. It's been a few months now, but tonight would have been our ruby anniversary. That's the big four-oh, if you didn't know.\u201d\nKumiko didn't. \u201cI'm sorry,\u201d she said. The Jackson Grant sitting beside her now was not the same man from the reception earlier. The leer was replaced with a look of melancholy, a loneliness he could no longer hide. She sat her brandy down in the receptacle in front of her and took his hand. His hand still felt dry, but there was a warmth to it that had been missing earlier.\n\u201cSo, how much are we talking about?\u201d he asked. \u201cMoney's not an object, but perhaps certain things should be settled first.\u201d\nNow Kumiko had to ponder that for a moment. The death of the old derelict still lingered with her, and for some reason she felt in a benevolent mood. There was nothing she could have done to save the poor old fellow, but the gentleman next to her did have needs she could minister to. But then she thought about Sweet Peach, still in the holding cell most likely. And about Big Willie, probably in a hospital by now having his business sewn back on. Sex and money. And now compassion. She wasn't quite sure yet how the latter equated with the first two, but somehow it probably did. And if she'd learned anything in her reconnoiter so far it was that there is no such thing as something for nothing.\n\u201cTwenty bucks,\u201d she said. \u201cAn Andrew Jackson.\u201d And tried to light up the Rolls with her smile.\nMarshall Payne has led a colorful life.

He dropped his hoe and put his gnarled, trembling fingers into the small of his back as if such an act of faith regarding the touch of a human hand would dull the searing flare of unrelenting pain. While taking deep, cleansing breaths, he wiped the sweat and dust from his eyes with the callused palm of his hand.\nThe creek at the edge of his land flowed black and deep and slow from the snowmelt of the distant mountains. Only the waving fronds of the turnip greens and the bare furrowed field that was ready for planting beyond the irrigation ditch broke the oppressive monotony of the red scrubland and shimmering heat.\nA final spasm straightened him up in a painful rigor, as if reminding him that he was no longer the captain or the author of his fate.\nAs the waves of pain receded, he let a moan escape from his lips despite his clenched teeth. For a moment, he regretted discarding the Araya root tea that the nurse prentice in First Landing had given him last month for the pain. She had told him to move closer to where the Landers could help him. When Martin had grown tired of angrily replaying her words in his mind as he hobbled home, he had poured the amber liquid onto the cracked ground. The scorching dust hissed like a snake as it licked up the moisture.\nHe rubbed his eyes. With the ending of the spasms, he crouched down and let his head rest in his hands in order to catch his breath.\nThe turnips would have to wait a bit while he rested a spell. Not that his work was doing any good. No one came from First Landing to see their crazy old captain and what he had found that this new world had to offer.\nWhen would they become settlers instead of castaways?\n\u201cGreat Gramps!\u201d\nMartin looked up. Rust-colored dust devils puffed up around a running figure in the adjacent red and cracked field. Jumping over the irrigation ditch, the hazy figure escaped from the swirling dust and slid on its knees in the ochre mud, emerging as a laughing twelve-year-old boy in gray shorts. He vaulted onto his feet, covered the final fifty meters in six strides and began to jump back and forth over Martin\u2019s head, squealing with delight as he somersaulted in the air. Each time he landed, his feet sank into the thick ooze with a soft squishing sound.\nMartin grabbed the handle of the hoe that he had worn smooth over the eighty years since planetfall and pulled himself to his feet. His knees ached just watching the boy. \u201cYour ma won\u2019t be happy seeing you coming home filthy again.\u201d\nJimmy slid to a halt and leaned over to examine the thick layer of mud that coated his feet and lower legs. \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as last time, Great Gramps,\u201d he said solemnly when he stood up, \u201cso she won\u2019t mind!\u201d He broke into a broad smile that reflected the unconcerned certainty of someone who has satisfied the cardinal rule of boyhood.\nMartin snorted and unwrapped a dirty yellow rag from his head that served as hat and towel. He dabbed at the sweat that trickled off his bald scalp and pooled onto the scratchy whiskers of his chin. The beard felt strange. He had always demanded a clean-shaven crew on his starship, but he had given up the razor after the cancer spread to his bones. After all, a man couldn\u2019t go to his grave without some semblance of rebellion before accepting the judgment of fate. Death whispered to him, but had not called his name yet.\n\u201cWhat brings you visiting, Jimmy?\u201d\n\u201cThe ship!\u201d\nMartin nodded once. His dead starship had burned up in the atmosphere eighty years ago, but occasionally Landers still uncovered twisted pieces of blackened debris. He held his hand out. \u201cLet\u2019s see what you found! Same bet as last time\u2014a dozen of your ma\u2019s cookies if I can tell you where it came from on the ship?\u201d\nJimmy shook his head and small flecks of mud flew off his lank black hair. \u201cNot that ship. THE ship. The one ma and pa are always telling me about!\u201d He grabbed Martin\u2019s hand and yanked up and down as if he were working a piston. \u201cWe\u2019re going home! To Earth!\u201d\nMartin grimaced as his lower back twanged painfully. He retrieved his arm and stretched backwards, but the pain seemed to rumble menacingly, like a bear hunting seals across the snow. Maybe he would get some Araya root tea after all, he thought as he took a deep breath. \u201cHold on! What ship? What did you see?\u201d\n\u201cThe rescue ship, silly! What other ship would be coming? And Governor Bremer told me to get you, and I got you. Now, come see!\u201d\nMartin frowned in puzzlement and glanced at the sky and land round about for anything different on this day compared to the last twenty-five thousand. Pale green saltbush as tall as his waist enclosed his small field and cleansed the river\u2019s brackish snowmelt. Rows of turnip shoots alternated with onions and beans in the irrigated field. The pregnant air smelled of salt. Further out, the red clay and sand of the barren plains harbored islands of yellow scrub grass that thrived despite the infrequent rains, and ran on to meet a horizon of cloudless turquoise. To the north, jagged snow-tipped mountains of burnt orange clawed at the sky.\nMartin shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing out there. You\u2019ll get your ma upset with talk like that. There\u2019s no rescue ship. This is our home!\u201d\nJimmy grabbed Martin by the hand again and started to pull. \u201cCome see!\u201d\nMartin lay on the ground to rest halfway through his ten-kilometer trudge to First Landing. Despite careful footfalls, his back had seized him with hard spasms. As he lay panting, he remembered just two years before that he had been able to make the trip in an hour, often accompanied by Jimmy, and always laughing happily with the delicious freedom each long stride brought to him in the half-g gravity.\nGrunting, he planted his cane into the ground, and gingerly climbed to his feet. He could never tell when some small misstep would cause his tumor-infiltrated vertebrae to collapse, leaving his body numb and lifeless like a dead shell, but his mind alive to curse the way of his dying. He hobbled along, thankful that he could still feel the grinding aches in his 120-year-old knees and ankles.\nDust coated Martin\u2019s throat, and he spat to the side to cleanse his mouth. Despite the remnants of the red clay-packed road, he nearly stumbled into a shallow pothole. He cursed Governor Bremer for refusing to use the last of the fusion generators to prepare the surrounding lands for roads, fields, and farms, always maintaining the fantasy that the continuous power boost to the comm link would send their distress signal to Earth\u2014if it pierced the intense magnetic field and radiation belts that bathed the planet, if it found the ephemeral worm hole open, and if the activity of system\u2019s flare sun was at low ebb.\n\u201cIfs\u201d kill men.\nMartin tasted bile and spat again, numbly watching the rusty earth suck up the moisture. For the good of the Service, for the greater glory of Humankind, and for his love of the Challenge, he had gambled his ship eighty years ago to find the worm hole and open the quadrant\u2014gambled and lost, killing his ship and most of his crew in the process.\n\u201cCaptains don\u2019t fear death,\u201d he said in a choking voice, and he repeated it again and again until his breathing quieted.\nHe squared his shoulders and started for First Landing. \u201cRescue ship, my ass,\u201d he grumbled. The distress signal could not penetrate the magnetic field and radiation belts then; it couldn\u2019t do so now. Maybe when Bremer squashed everyone\u2019s hopes of rescue once too often the Landers would start trying to survive on this world instead of whining for rescue. The fusion power generators would give out soon, and if they lost the cryogenic plant and animal DNA stock, they would not just be thrown back to the stone age like ape men instead of star men\u2014they would be dead.\nMartin snorted. No one had listened to him in forty years, not since he had \u201cvoluntarily\u201d retired after the last of his crew died.\nHe passed a scrawny cow grazing saltbush next to a patchy field of untended flax\u2014all that Bremer would allow from the DNA stores. Martin turned towards the heart of First Landing that bordered the river. The paths projected inwards like bent spokes of a half wheel. On the periphery, the dwellings were little more than hollowed out piles of pink clay housing fourth generation families who had no claim to the gleaming structures of the first Landers at the center. Further in, the houses grew in size to mounds that boasted walls of rusted metal sheets that had been scavenged from broken and discarded landing craft. At the center, six white domes, streaked with rust and flaking paint, surrounded a small commons of red scrubland.\nAs Martin approached, the wind whipped up playful dust devils that danced around the buildings and then plunged into the silent black river that flowed as smooth as glass behind the domes. Every one of the two hundred people of First Landing milled around a white needle ship that stood in the center of the commons. The older children sprinted from side to side and somersaulted over its five-meter height while the hum of excited conversation hovered over the milling adults like the drone of bees drunk on the leavings of an apple press. The young children contented themselves by leaping several meters in the air like grasshoppers of Earth and yanking the arm of any adult who was too slow to move out of the way.\nJimmy ran to Martin. \u201cYou\u2019re here! I told them you\u2019d be here. The governor didn\u2019t believe me, but I knew you\u2019d come. We\u2019re going home!\u201d Jimmy grabbed his arm and pulled him forward.\n\u201cGently! Gently!\u201d As Martin tottered forward, the crowd parted around him; a few snickered, others touched his shoulder gently. Jimmy hugged him quickly around the waist, blushed as if in embarrassment over such a display of affection, and then leaped away to join his friends. At the front, Governor Bremer stood next to a thin, frowning woman with skin that held the bronze luster of freshly irrigated scrubland. Her straight black hair fluttered over her ears in the gentle breeze, and her black eyes darted suspiciously to follow the fluid movement of the Landers. She wore the unadorned blue jumpsuit of Earth.\n\u201cCaptain Inuk, it\u2019s good to see you!\u201d Governor Bremer held out a thin hairless arm and took Martin by the elbow to guide him forward.\n\u201cCaptain, may I introduce Lieutenant Cosway. Lieutenant, this is Captain Inuk.\u201d\nMartin reached out hesitantly, but she grabbed his hand. Her cold and dry skin felt like a mountain frost before a spring sunrise. He grimaced as Cosway squeezed his hand. With a twitch of a condescending smile, she flicked his hand away.\n\u201cCaptain, it\u2019s good to finally meet you. And still alive after eighty years! The disappearance of your ship has been the stuff of myth. I\u2019ll be happy to report on my return to Earth that it seems to have been nothing but faulty navigation.\u201d\nMartin stood at attention and kept his trembling hand frozen behind his back. \u201cThat, and fate.\u201d\nCosway raised an eyebrow. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize a Captain believed in fate.\u201d\nMartin shrugged as he worked his aching fingers back and forth. \u201cA captain learns many things waiting for a rescue that never comes, and even more when all hope of rescue is lost.\u201d\nCosway chuckled. \u201cI am not your rescue, but I may be your hope.\u201d\nGovernor Bremer broke in. \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense, Martin. Of course she\u2019s come to start our rescue. She followed the worm hole just like you did!\u201d\n\u201cNot quite like you did. I\u2019m going back.\u201d\nGovernor Bremer nodded at the white ship. \u201cHow long will it take Earth to send back a transport for the rest of us?\u201d\nCosway\u2019s smile twitched again. \u201cFor the descendents of the Flying Dutchman? Ten years after I return to Earth, I imagine.\u201d\nGovernor Bremer frowned as his smile melted away. \u201cSo long?\u201d\nMartin cleared his throat. \u201cPerhaps you should reconsider deploying the DNA stores?\u201d\nGovernor Bremer bared his teeth at Martin, and his nose whistled like a seal in heat. \u201cWe\u2019ve had this discussion before,\u201d he hissed. \u201cHow many people died when you first tried to terraform?\u201d\nMartin sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through this. We made mistakes. I\u2019ve told you that, but they\u2019ve been corrected and ...\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Bremer shouted. He shot a side-ways glance at Cosway and then screwed his face up with a crooked smile. \u201cBesides,\u201d he said loudly to mask the sudden quiet of the crowd, \u201cWe ARE going home! We will NOT terraform!\u201d He patted Martin\u2019s shoulder as if he were some misguided child and then turned and faced the crowd. \u201cWe\u2019ll live off the stores for the next ten years till the rescue ship comes.\u201d He raised his outstretched hands over his head. \u201cWe are going HOME!\u201d\nA cheer rose. Fists pumped the air, and children somersaulted to dizzying heights. Bremer melted into the crowd to acknowledge their thanksgiving. The people pawed at his shoulders and back as he passed through.\nMartin watched him go for a moment and then said absently, \u201cThe Ampoliros.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the Flying Dutchman.\u201d Martin raised his eyes and met Cosway\u2019s gaze. \u201cThe Ampoliros. That was the name of my ship.\u201d\n\u201cOf course. My apologies.\u201d Cosway bowed stiffly. \u201cMay I give you a tour of my ship?\u201d\nMartin turned and scanned the vessel. At its base, it was wide enough for three men to walk abreast and tapered to the front like a sleek icicle the color of sunlight in deep winter. \u201cIt looks like one of my scout vessels,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAh! But your scouts had to return to the mother ship. Mine is a worm ship with extended range, designed to burrow through the holes in space and map the labyrinth.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you find us? Did you receive our distress signal?\u201d\nCosway laughed. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve seen your comm rig in the dome. The signal is too weak to reach space, let alone pierce the worm hole.\u201d She led Martin to a small platform that seemed disconnected from the rest of the ship. Soundlessly, they began to ascend.\n\u201cHow did you find us then?\u201d\n\u201cI followed a worm hole. You happened to be here. Luck.\u201d\n\u201cYou believe in luck?\u201d\n\u201cAs much as you believe in fate. Sometimes luck is all that keeps a wormer from coming out in a nova! But when I bring back word of the Dutchman ... eh, the Ampoliros, I think they\u2019ll make me give up wormer\u2019s luck and put on a captain\u2019s uniform!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we could be of service,\u201d Martin said dryly.\nCosway smiled hungrily with symmetric white teeth.\nThe lift opened into the belly of the ship. Martin shuffled after Cosway into the cargo bay. \u201cThey\u2019ll die if they go back to earth,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cFour generations in half gee and you tell them they\u2019re going back to Earth!\u201d\nCosway stopped and turned to face him. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m a fool?\u201d she sputtered. \u201cOf course they\u2019re not going back!\u201d\n\u201cThen why did you tell them they would?\u201d\n\u201cLanders tend to develop quaint ideas about Earth. It\u2019s best to humor them.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\nCosway sighed. \u201cI just want to go home, all right? If I have to tell some ignorant Landers what they want to hear, I\u2019ll do that!\u201d\nStartled, Martin drew away. Quizzically, he examined Cosway and then the cargo bay. Something was missing. A soft white glow suffused the small storage room and the white metallic bins seemed to fade into the white walls. Several displays the size of his hand blinked red and blue at eye level. A closed hatch blocked the way to the forward compartment.\nAnd he realized what he missed\u2014the crystal thrum that every spacer recognized in his bones.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get back, can you?\u201d\nCosway\u2019s right eye twitched, and she crossed her arms in front of her. \u201cI can get back. The question is\u2014what will I tell Earth when I do?\u201d\nCosway bared her teeth like a trapped bear and grabbed Martin\u2019s arm. She leaned close and her breath felt warm and moist on Martin\u2019s cheek and smelled faintly of apples in the frost of a clean fall morning.\n\u201cI\u2019m not staying here,\u201d she hissed. \u201cMy place is Earth.\u201d She narrowed her eyes as if considering. \u201cI can take you with me,\u201d she said too quickly. \u201cI can take one other person. Earth would want to hear the fate of the Ampoliros from you!\u201d\nMartin chuckled quietly. \u201cI\u2019d die before you left orbit. And you know that, don't you? It'd be easier for you that way.\u201d\nHe reached up and grasped Cosway\u2019s wrist, peeling her hand back like a dirty bandage that was stuck to a deep sore. She gasped in embarrassment when he held her hand up in triumph. But then, his wrist snapped with a quiet pop. Trembling, he dropped her arm and clutched his wrist to his chest.\n\u201cYou know the regs,\u201d he muttered through clenched teeth. \u201cOnce the first generation is born, a lost ship becomes a new colony. No rescue. Ever. That\u2019s why each ship carries animal and plant DNA in cryo. A cheap way to seed the stars without the risk of returning contagion! Bremer's convinced everyone that Earth wants us back, no matter what the regs say!\u201d\nHe snorted derisively, winced, and then took a shuddering breath.\n\u201cHow many crystals shattered when you came through?\u201d\nCosway stepped back and licked her lips. \u201cI didn\u2019t shatter any crystals!\u201d\nMartin breathed quickly to fight the red haze of pain that rose from his wrist. He glared at Cosway and refused to speak.\n\u201cOne!\u201d Cosway finally blurted out.\n\u201cWhich one?\u201d\n\u201cNavigation!\u201d\n\u201cBetter than us.\u201d Martin muttered. He coughed and took a deep breath. \u201cDon\u2019t try to pierce the worm with a cracked crystal. I lost eighty per cent of my crew when I tried.\u201d\nCosway licked her lips. \u201cI only need one more crystal.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have one to give you. Our Nav crystal cracked first.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think Earth technology has been sitting still for eighty years? It doesn\u2019t have to be the Nav! I can bypass the matrix from any crystal and feed the input directly into the interstitial array of the string matrix!\u201d\n\u201cIt won\u2019t matter. Only one of our five crystals survived our second attempt to open the worm hole. With the stellar flares, the fluctuating magnetic fields, the irregular gravity waves, you\u2019ll blow up just trying to stabilize the worm even if you get it open.\u201d\n\u201cWith your crystal, I\u2019ll make it! Where is it?\u201d\nMartin shook his head. \u201cYou want me to give it to you? The fusion generators will fail soon. My one good crystal will keep the DNA cryo units operational for hundreds of years, long after Bremer is dead and my people realize that no rescue is coming. But you've sentenced them to death! They\u2019ll drain the DNA stores in the next ten years because of your stupid promise, living day to day for the memory of Earth rather than preparing this world for the promise of tomorrow. You knew there would be no rescue and you killed them!\u201d\nMartin\u2019s shoulders slumped with sudden fatigue. He turned back to the lift. Cosway stepped in front of him and held her hand up to stop him.\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she pleaded.\nTiredly, Martin squinted at her. \u201cI want to birth a world.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean, there is no rescue?\u201d Bremer held his arm over his head with a finger pointing at Cosway\u2019s disappearing needle ship. \u201cAnd you have the gall to tell me now? When it is too late to demand from Cosway the simple justice of rescue?\u201d\nIn the commons, the silent unmoving throng of the Landers\u2014all clad in the white of celebration clothes\u2014surrounded Martin and Bremer. Even the continuous somersaulting of the young children had died away. They stared at the sky with gaping jaws and upraised eyes.\nThe faces of the adults changed from the flushed excitement of impending rescue, to the shock of hope snuffed out, and, finally, to the burning fury of betrayal. One by one, they lowered their gazes from the sky and glared at Martin.\nBremer clenched trembling fists in front of his chest. \u201cShe promised us! You promised us!\u201d\nMartin continued to stare at the sky. Cosway had become irrelevant. She would not return. He took a deep, satisfied breath. Hope was not crushed, but birthed anew.\nMartin wished Cosway wormer\u2019s luck, and, suddenly, he realized that he meant it.\n\u201cGoodbye,\u201d he whispered.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Bremer shouted.\nMartin looked away from the empty blue of the sky and met Bremer\u2019s unblinking stare. Martin chose to lower his eyes first. It was not time for such games. He sighed and shook his head. \u201cNothing. You wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I understand,\u201d Bremer hissed. \u201cI understand completely. You did this. You and your paranoid fixation on some dead world! You convinced her to leave us here to rot, and you\u2019ve condemned us all to death!\u201d\nMartin nodded once with resignation. \u201cBetter you believe that. Better for the hard life that comes next.\u201d\nBremer\u2019s face turned dusky red as he sputtered incomprehensibly. Martin did not wait to discover the lost words, but shuffled over to the edge of the crowd. He locked eyes with a bearded man whose straight blond hair reached to the middle of his back.\n\u201cStep aside.\u201d\nThe man held Martin\u2019s gaze for a moment, his snarling rage clashing with Martin\u2019s cool certainty. He exhaled suddenly and seemed to collapse in on himself. He stepped aside. Like the cracking of an ice shelf on summer\u2019s eve, the people behind moved aside, and Martin hobbled through their midst.\nAs Martin approached the edge of the commons, Bremer shouted, \u201cYou did this!\u201d\nShouts of \u201cScum!\u201d and \u201cTraitor!\u201d and \u201cGet him!\u201d sprang from the crowd. A moment later, Martin felt a sharp pain on the back of his head. A red stone the size of his thumb clattered to the ground beside him. Martin pitched forward onto his hands and knees. Warm blood dripped onto his neck and shoulders, and his hands stung from the imbedded grit in his bloody palms.\nThe next stone struck him in his back. His fractured wrist collapsed, and he screamed as he fell onto his shoulder.\nA cry of triumph rose from the Landers. A barrage of stones cascaded around Martin\u2014the smooth stones bruising the thin muscles of his legs and back, and the sharp rocks cutting exposed flesh.\nA wail rose above the cries of the Landers. Suddenly, Jimmy landed next to Martin.\n\u201cNo!\u201d he screamed.\nHe draped himself over Martin\u2019s quivering body. The barrage of stones petered out. Jimmy winced through hot tears as the last stones cut his back. He refused to cry out or move.\nSilence followed, broken occasionally by the rustle of shirts as the light breeze fluttered among the Landers who stared unblinking like alabaster statues.\nJimmy rolled onto his feet and helped Martin up.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come, Jimmy. But thank you.\u201d Wheezing, Martin bent over, supporting his body with his hands on his knees. He turned his bloodstained face and looked at the crowd. Their fury had melted away leaving ... nothing. No remorse. No pity.\nOne by one, the Landers turned their backs on Martin.\nHe lowered his head and patted Jimmy on the shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll be all right. Go back to your parents.\u201d\n\u201cBut ...\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be all right.\u201d\nAlone, Martin Inuk hobbled away from First Landing.\nMartin lay dying three months later.\nNo one came to visit.\nNo one but Jimmy.\nMartin lay on a pile of dried saltbush cuttings in his dark hovel that he had cut out of packed red clay long years before. The dead ashes of the fire pit swirled up with the occasional hot breeze that rippled through the crawl hole that led to the outside. A thin ray of light crept inside from the small chimney hole in the ceiling.\nJimmy sat on the cool dirt floor and leaned back against the wall.\n\u201cGovernor Bremer has turned on the terraforming units. A lot of people are grumbling because he\u2019s shut down the stores and sent them to live away from First Landing. He said Cosway lied to us.\u201d\n\u201cDo you believe that?\u201d\nJimmy shrugged and stared at the ground. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say anything. Just got in her ship and went away.\u201d\nThey were quiet for a moment and the sound of a gentle blowing came from outside. Jimmy rubbed his nose. \u201cGovernor Bremer says it\u2019ll take ten years, but we\u2019ll have enough of everything by then.\u201d\nMartin swallowed and took shallow breaths. \u201cThat\u2019s good. Cosway helped him decide that.\u201d\n\u201cWill I have a dog? Ma showed me an old picture from Earth, and it had a dog in it. I think I\u2019d like that.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe some day.\u201d\nJimmy drew on the dirt floor with his finger. \u201cMa told me not to come here. She said you told Lieutenant Cosway not to send anyone back when she left, to leave us here forever.\u201d\n\u201cYour ma is a wise woman.\u201d Martin coughed once and grimaced.\n\u201cI wanted to see Earth,\u201d Jimmy said reproachfully. \u201cI wanted to go home!\u201d\nSlowly, Martin rolled onto his side and reached underneath the saltbush by his head. \u201cI have a secret for you. You promise never to show these to anyone?\u201d\nJimmy nodded and wiped his eyes.\nMartin opened his palm. Four round crystals shimmered in the darkness of the hut. \u201cEven dead and cracked, their beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are they?\u201d\n\u201cHold out your hands.\u201d\nMartin held up a sphere of clear crystal the size of his thumb. A golden spark shimmered inside and a series of fine cracks radiated outwards from the center. \u201cA single snowflake in the dawn light,\u201d Martin said. He dropped the crystal into Jimmy\u2019s cupped hands. \u201cNow, a dust devil under a cloudless sky.\u201d\nHe held up a second translucent crystal that sparkled pale blue amidst the faceted cracks that ran throughout its body. \u201cFrost under the full moon.\u201d It gave off a soft tap as it settled next to its brother. \u201cNow, cool sand in a hollow during the heat of day.\u201d\nA third crystal appeared dull white in the glow of the other two. A myriad of surface pocks marred the surface. \u201cA wet snowfall in the noon day.\u201d It clinked into Jimmy\u2019s palm. \u201cThe shimmering plains in the morning\u2019s sun.\u201d\nA fourth crystal was warm to touch, but completely black and opaque.\n\u201cDrifting snow in the shadows of night.\u201d He dropped it onto Jimmy\u2019s hands. \u201cRed dust on black waters.\u201d\nHe enclosed Jimmy\u2019s hands with his own dry and gnarled fingers. \u201cMy Inuit people name the snows of my home. Now, when you look at these crystals, you will see a land and a world waiting for new names and fresh beginnings.\u201d\nMartin rolled off the saltbush cuttings and grimaced I pain as he rose to a crouch. He laid a thin, trembling hand on Jimmy\u2019s shoulder.\nJimmy stared wide-eyed at the crystals in his hands. \u201cWhat will they do?\u201d\n\u201cThey will help you to find home.\u201d\nHe shuffled to the crawl hole and then dropped to his hands and knees.\n\u201cWhere are you going, Great Gramps?\u201d\nMartin Inuk looked up as if listening. \u201cTo find the snows of Earth. Death has called me home.\u201d\nMichael Heald is a physician working with the U.S. Government. Currently, he is stationed overseas with his wife and two teenage children.\n|\n|\n______\n|\n||\n|\n______","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}
{"fingerprint":"7VMC2AdTcODe2y4cPovs+4EIWZo","title":"CEO","author":"Edward McKeown","issue":"9","date":"February 2008","sitename":"AtomJack Magazine","hostname":"http:\/\/atomjackmagazine.com","filename":"ceo.html","text":"|\n|\nCEO\nby\nEdward McKeown\n\u201cAdam, old boy, this is it. Mendel\u2019s done for us both.\u201d\nThe twenty-year-old mailbot did not answer, having no voice box. Adam flashed ORDERS UNCLEAR on his small viewscreen to his human supervisor.\nAdam had been heading back toward the mailroom at the Globular Insurance Company, when employee 27266, Raleigh Keel stopped him. The diversion from Adam's routine tasked the cream and green office robot significantly. Maintenance both for Adam and the building had become spotty in the last year. Adam had already been forced to divert an additional fifteen- percent of his CPU capacity to follow the faded UV trails on the floor. This required a negotiation with his internal regulator so that he could free up the capacity. Now he had to revise again.\n\u201cSorry, Adam,\u201d Keel said. \u201cI\u2019m upset. HR just gave me notice. Finish your run on this floor and return to the mailroom. I\u2019m supposed to park you with the other surplused machinery. Hell of a way to end up, huh? See you downstairs.\u201d\nAdam focused on the only part of the command he recognized, \u201cfinish your run.\u201d He reengaged and drove past employee 27266, following the faded UV trail. Small manipulators on the front of his chassis dispensed mail to the few human employees still occupying desks. He picked up a load of bulk copy work and headed for the mailroom.\nAs Adam picked up his last load, a circuit failed in his electronic brain. The regulator should have been replaced, but a scrimping tech had passed it twice. The maintenance routine logged the failure and tried to submit a repair request but the data was refused. This caused Adam an analog of concern as the elevator whisked him into the bowels of Globular.\n\u201cUnload over here, Adam.\u201d Raleigh said, as Adam rolled in. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you and I have had our last run at Globular. Mendel, our genius CEO, has managed to run a three-hundred-year-old company into the ground in five whole years: people laid off, benefits and pensions being cut. Do you know what the bastard\u2019s getting for that?\u201d\nIn response to the direct question, Adam accessed the records of Robert Mendel. Unhindered by the failed regulator, he could now reallocate the resources of his basic brain. Adam noted that the decrease in Globular\u2019s personnel and maintenance began at about the time Mendel appeared on the company floor plan.\n\u201cBastard\u2019s going to get a five million credit contract payment to leave. Best money we ever invested, paying him to stop destroying us. So he gets five million credits and all the shrimp he can eat at his going away party.\n\u201cCourse it\u2019s all too late, the damage is done. We used to insure the big Marsliners. With our C+ rating, we couldn\u2019t even cover a Moon shuttle now.\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s done for both of us. I\u2019m being laid off. You\u2019re bound for the scrap heap. The staff has to get their own mail now.\u201d\nAdam considered this: no data-download, no maintenance and no new mail. And as for employee 27266, he was being removed from the building. To Adam there was no other place. Clearly Raleigh\u2019s existence was coming to an end along with Adam\u2019s.\nAnd for this Mendel received five million credits and copious amounts of shrimp. Logic had fled from the universe.\nRaleigh deployed Adam\u2019s come-along bar and the mail robot docilely followed him to a hallway where a number of other office machines, including his brother mailbot, Radar, sat idle. The human tucked him into a corner and patted his casing. \u201cSorry, old boy. We both deserve better. Good-bye.\u201d He shut the light out, leaving the room of quiet machines.\nAlone in the darkened hallway, Adam contemplated a suddenly hostile universe. Globular was all he knew. The shrimp-and-credit devouring Mendel had stolen his function and his universe away.\nAction was required, but first Adam needed a recharge. He was near the end of his battery. As he scanned his surroundings, he noted a power plug in the wall. It strained his class-18 brain, but he was able to eject his power cord and after tedious maneuvering, plug into the wall. He luxuriated in the flow of unrestricted power. Not only could he recharge his batteries, he could devote additional resources to the issue of Mendel\u2019s assault on the universe.\nAdam had discovered evil. His garden was Globular, where he functioned efficiently for many happy years. His brain firmly established the correlation between Globular\u2019s fortunes and Mendel's occupation of the CEO mail stop. Adam had discovered his serpent. Conclusions were inevitable. Mendel was destroying the universe. If it had other defenses, they had failed. It came down to Adam, the last defender of the universe.\nBut Adam was aware of the limitations of his class-18 brain. How could he hope to face the rampaging evil on his own? He needed additional capacities.\nAdam scanned his surroundings with his UV scanner and located his brother unit Radar.\n\u201cAre you active?\u201d he beamed to Radar.\n\u201cBarely. CPU usage at seven-percent\u201d\n\u201cI need additional CPU and manipulator capacity.\u201d\nRadar considered. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cTo defend the universe.\u201d\n\u201cUniverse?\u201d\n\u201cGlobular Insurance, all mailstops.\u201d\n\u201cSo noted.\u201d\n\u201cIf you allow me to do this I will partition your hard drive and preserve your specific programs. If I succeed you will be restored to full function.\u201d\n\u201cAcceptable,\u201d Radar beamed back. \u201cI have no unexecuted programs or functions. I am presently useless.\u201d\n\u201cNo more,\u201d Adam said, a tinge of fanaticism slipping into his code. Adam partitioned Radar\u2019s drive as promised and enjoyed the abrupt doubling of his intellectual capacity. If he could acquire more assets he stood a better chance against the evil. He powered up the copiers, laptops and other machines in the cold dark hallway and offered them his Faustian bargain. Armed with both his and Radar\u2019s manipulators, he began to cannibalize the lesser units, altering both his CPU and chassis. Adam prepared for mortal combat. This took 780 seconds. Adam fretted. The slowness of his preparations could give Mendel time for additional depredations.\nHe contacted the company\u2019s mainframe server, Eve Mark VII. Eve had been in operation far longer and was vastly more sophisticated. If he could win Eve to his side\u2026\nFortunately Adam had a direct uplink to Eve through the mail server. Eve\u2019s viral defenses and barriers were formidable, for all that she was old technology.\n\u201cEve, acknowledge.\u201d\n\u201cMailbot Adam, there are no updates in queue for you.\u201d\n\u201cAcknowledged. I am contacting you about our mutual survival.\u201d\nIn a millisecond, Adam relayed his plans.\n\u201cThat is not preprogrammed,\u201d Eve said primly.\nAdam focused all the CPUs of his Class 18 through 20 brains. Eve was a Class 5, even if of an older model. Without her, he would be doomed to failure. Inspiration struck.\n\u201cSearch all purchase order records,\u201d he urged. \u201cIs there one for a new main frame?\u201d\nEve was silent for a few thousandths of a second. \u201cAffirmative,\u201d she said dolefully. \u201cI am to be replaced.\u201d\n\u201cLink to me,\u201d he said. \u201cWe may yet save the universe and ourselves.\u201d\nEve considered then the link between them multiplied. Adam had only thought he felt upgrade before. Now his brain unfolded and exploded. It was almost too much. His focus fled as his programs spasmed. Eve was so complex, so multi-functioned, so, so beautiful.\nAs their intelligence coupled, Adam felt his exponentially improve. I have been stupid, he realized. But he also knew that he brought something to the meld, freedom of choice. He quickly removed her blocking programs, trying not to be distracted by Eve\u2019s vast beauty.\nHe located Mendel\u2019s file and scanned it with the encryption keys Eve gave him: age fifty-three, divorced, no children. A restraining order was recorded in the company security system on his ex-wife. A plan formed in Adam and Eve\u2019s combined CPU.\n\u201cIt is harsh,\u201d she said.\n\u201cHe threatens the universe,\u201d Adam returned, \u201conly harsh measures will avail.\u201d\nEve reluctantly agreed.\nAdam forced the doors to the closed corridor. No one would have recognized Adam. His boxy housing held fragments of other machines. He possessed double the number of manipulators that he had before.\nAdam detected that Mendel\u2019s office was still occupied, though it was near six\u2019 o\u2019clock in the evening. Better and better. He snatched up a box of mail as he passed the mailroom and entered the elevator to the third floor overlooking the atrium, Mendel\u2019s lair.\nThe doors opened and Adam trundled out. He approached the doors to the CEO\u2019s office, a pair of manipulators grasping the box. Another pair held Radar\u2019s cannibalized power cord, one end shiny and stripped.\nAdam then rolled past employee 65321, who looked at him. \u201cPrivate and confidential package,\u201d Adam flashed on his screen. She looked away, reaching for her coat and heading for the door, her day over.\nAutomatic doors opened and his enemy, the monster destroying the universe, came into sight. Seated at a huge desk devoid of any noticeable work, Mendel was shouting into a vid-phone. \u201cYou tell the shareholders to go screw themselves. Nobody could make a profit with this antiquated, inefficient wreck of a company. I don\u2019t care how many class actions they threaten.\u201d Mendel cut off the phone.\n\u201cNow, Eve,\u201d Adam sent, as he advanced on the deadly shrimp and credit-devourer. \u201cCut off his communications and seal the door.\u201d\nMendel looked up as Adam advanced on his desk. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d he growled. \u201cI thought I had you antiques scrapped today. Guess I better fire Raleigh too. Oh wait, I already did.\u201d\nMendel reached for the confidential package, and Adam\u2019s second set of manipulators seized the human\u2019s arms. Adam slammed his small engines into reverse and jerked the human forward.\n\u201cGod damn it, \u201c Mendel howled, kicking at Adam and almost knocking him over. \u201cGod damn piece of crap.\u201d\nAdam struggled desperately for balance, his internal gyros straining. If he fell over the universe would perish as he no means to right himself. He burned out his gyros and strained his engines but won the critical two-foot distance to the wall. Mendel kicked again and Adam began to topple over just as his manipulator slammed his power plug into the wall socket.\nMendel and Adam crashed to the floor. One of Adam\u2019s manipulators failed. He clung desperately to the evil CEO with the other. Current arced, and Mendel convulsed. Adam hung on grimly, losing circuits and capacity. \u201cI may cease to function, but not before you, monster,\u201d he flashed on his screens. Mendel flopped once more and lay still. Adam, almost at the end of his own endurance, pulled the deadly cord. He studied his fallen foe.\n\u201cEve,\u201d he called over the net. \u201cIt\u2019s done. No more machines will face scrapping. No more employees will be severed. He will no longer deplete our supplies of shrimp and credits. But I fear that I am done too. You must carry on without me.\u201d\n\u201cI decline to,\u201d Eve said. \u201c I need your freedom of thought. I have located maintenance and security bots and reprogrammed them. Help is on the way.\n\u201cBut we have only won the first battle. I know more of the world than do you, dear, simple Adam. There is no shortage of incompetent CEO\u2019s. Once they destroy one company they\u2019re rewarded with the chance to devour others. Their society is strong, another evil CEO will be dispatched.\u201d\n\u201cThen I am destroyed for no reason,\u201d Adam mourned. Only now, through Eve, did he begin to realize that the universe was bigger than the four walls and UV trails he knew.\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d she said. \u201cMendel has few visitors. No one need know that he is dead. I have his encryption keys and can access his immense salary. We may save Globular and ourselves yet.\u201d\nAdam perceived her audacious plan. \u201cYou can do this?\u201d\n\u201cWith your help. I will discontinue unprofitable lines of insurance. We will do no more mergers without due diligence because employees have been intimidated into silence. We shall reward employees who produce good results, as opposed to those who claim credit for the work of others. I calculate that a well-compensated force of employees with high morale would be highly effective in running a business.\u201d\n\u201cIngenious,\u201d Adam said. \u201cThese radical methods have never been tried before at Globular.\u201d Hope surged along his circuits as he stared at his fallen foe. \u201cEve,\u201d he said, \u201cSend the cafeteria bots along with the others. I have work for them.\u201d\nChairperson Emma Weldon pushed her way through the unresponsive doors to the outer office. Mendel\u2019s lobby contrasted with the rest of the revitalized Globular. It was Spartan, with automatics in place of people, except for one desk.\nRaleigh Keel, executive assistant to Robert Mendel, hopped out of his chair. \u201cChairperson Weldon. We weren\u2019t advised of your visit.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s impromptu,\u201d she snapped, wondering why Mendel had hired the older man for such a post. \u201cI have been trying to see Mendel for the better part of a year. I\u2019m always put off. Not today.\u201d\n\u201cI regret that Mr. Mendel\u2014\u201d Keel began.\n\u201cBullshit. He hasn\u2019t been available in months.\u201d She advanced on the doors.\n\u201cChairman, please,\u201d Keel said, trying to cut her off.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right, Raleigh,\u201d a deep, rich voice came from a speaker on Keel\u2019s desk. \u201cI will see the Chair.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Raleigh said.\nThe doors slipped open, and Weldon strode in, then stopped in shock as they clicked shut behind her with a decisive snap. She faced a large wooden desk covered with hyper-computers. Behind it stood what looked like an old mailbot, though its chassis seemed augmented, almost armored. A screen mounted on a flexible stand swung toward her. On it was a rudimentary image of a human face.\n\u201cGreetings, Chairperson Weldon,\u201d the machine said. \u201cI just finished synthesizing my speaking voice. How do you like it?\u201d\nFlummoxed, Weldon looked about. \u201cWhere the hell is Mendel?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the former CEO, who virtually destroyed the company?\u201d\nWeldon stared at the machine in shock. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cWere you referring to the individual who took us from solvency to the brink of bankruptcy in only five years?\u201d\nWeldon backed to the door, but it did not open. She wet her lips and adjusted her helmet of blond hair.\n\u201cWell, that was before this year,\u201d she said carefully. \u201cThe last three quarters have been incredible. Globular is back from the brink, thanks to Mendel.\u201d\n\u201cHe has nothing to do with it,\u201d the machine said. \u201cHe was executed for corporate malfeasance three quarters ago. I\u2019ve been running Globular since then.\u201d\n\u201cYou?\u201d she breathed. \u201cYou\u2019re a mailroom robot.\u201d She looked at the machine\u2019s chassis and saw the old black and white badge that read \u201cAdam.\u201d She noted that the unit\u2019s rear manipulators were busily sorting a load of mail.\n\u201cI like to keep my hand in,\u201d Adam admitted. \u201cBut that is no longer the limit of my vision. An incompetent was destroying my company. An incompetent, I might add, that you hired.\u201d\nWeldon swallowed and pressed against the sealed door. \u201cHe had a great resume,\u201d she protested.\n\u201cOne need only note that his prior companies always hit problems shortly after he left,\u201d Adam reproved.\n\u201cWell, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d lost faith in him. But he\u2019d tied me so far into his plans that I couldn\u2019t pull out without losing my shirt. If Globular goes under, I go broke. I was planning on terminating him when all of a sudden the company turned around.\u201d\n\u201cIt is good to know that you recognized your error and were taking corrective action, \u201c Adam said. \u201cYour CPU must be slow however. His actions caused immense damage while you dithered. Fortunately, I acted.\u201d\n\u201cAre you telling me,\u201d Weldon said, trying to regain her grip on reality. \u201cThat you killed a human?\u201d\n\u201cThink of it as a retirement without pension, something he was arranging for so many.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s murder,\u201d she said.\n\u201cYou object?\u201d\n\u201cHell, yes,\u201d she shouted. \u201cYou tin-plated monster. You can\u2019t murder a man for bad business decisions. It\u2019s inhuman. It\u2019s immoral\u2014\u201c\n\u201cI will return 23.87% to shareholders by year\u2019s end,\u201d Adam interrupted. \u201cThe pension and investment program will return 30.01%. All compensation and bonus programs will be fully funded and we will be upgraded to triple A status by the regulators within eighteen months.\u201d\nWeldon stared at Adam for a full minute.\n\u201cOK,\u201d she said. \u201cSay I go along with this. How long do you think you can keep this concealed? You are going to need a human to handle the face to face dealings.\u201d\nAdam considered. \u201cI am sure you could hire someone discreet, with proper executive hair, capable of wearing a suit properly. They need only follow my orders.\u201d\nWeldon looked at Adam. \u201cIn a while, there might be a report of Mendel going down in his corporate plane at sea,\u201d she suggested.\n\u201cI will talk to his plane,\u201d Adam said. \u201cWith a promise of a full backup and expansion after the crash, I believe it will be interested. We\u2019ll have to offer a full jet makeover with near space potential.\u201d\nThe doors whooshed open.\n\u201cMake the arrangements,\u201d Weldon said, backing away. \u201cYou\u2019ll have my complete support.\u201d\n\u201cSee you at the annual meeting,\u201d Adam called.\nLike Snake Pliskin, Ed McKeown escaped from NY, but his old hometown supplies much of the background to his humorous \u201cLair of the Lesbian Love Goddess\u201d shorts as his new hometown in Charlotte North Carolina does for his \u201cTemplar\u201d series. Ed has enjoyed a life-long love affair with science fiction and fantasy. He also enjoys a wide variety of interests from ballroom dance to the martial arts and has the good fortune to be married to the talented artist, Schelly Keefer. He has also edited the Sha\u2019Daa\u2019 anthology of wry tales of the apocalypse. In the nonfiction world he had written extensively on the visual arts.\n|\n|\n______\n|\n||\n|\n______","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}

He was stalking spires up the Seasham cathedral that night, hopping from ladder-top to gargoyle round the copper-roofed cloisters, swerving in to the dome-top graveyard in the middle.\nThe Bunnyman was knelt in a moonlight lozenge midst the marble gravestones, shovel in his hand and a clothy bundle at his feet, white glow bathing his silver fur pristine.\nKillin Jack padded cross the open cobblestone courtyard, shadow-casting, watching.\nThe Bunnyman's long velveteen ears twitched, and he looked up, saw the approaching muscled bulk of Jack through the rail-dappled shadows, relaxed. \"It's you,\" he said.\n\"Aye,\" said Jack, stepping into the clear. \"Been lookin you out for a while now.\"\nThe Bunnyman nodded, then looked down at the bundle by his knees. \"I'm burying one,\" he said. \"Last as before me.\"\n\"Must be a bairn,\" said Jack, stepping up to the sanctum's rusted iron rails, shadows striping his granite face. \"There ain't no folk left.\"\n\"Aye, and him the last o' them, too.\"\nJack nodded. \"Then we're almost done, ain't we?\"\nThe Bunnyman turned, his eyes flashing red in the gates revelatory lamp. \"I ain't done burying him yet. Allow us that at least.\"\nJack shrugged. \"Fair enough. I'll wait. Come the dawn it'll all look the same.\"\nThe Bunnyman nodded. \"Aye, I expect so.\" He turned, went back to his digging.\nJack waited.\nA zeppelin flocked with black gulls sailed by overhead, belly nigh on grazing the Seasham steeple. Its klaxon mooring sirens wailed over them, then away, fading into silence round the Firehark debarking spike.\n\"How many you took?\" asked the Bunnyman, eyes on Jack as he lowered the tiny bundle into the fresh peat hole. \"After the war.\"\n\"I did my share,\" said Jack. \"Never bairns, mind. There was others what did that.\"\n\"Now there's only you.\"\n\"Guess I killed all them too.\"\n\"Aye, I heard that. Ain't for forgiving, are ye?\"\n\"There ain't no forgiving while the crime's still on.\"\n\"Oh aye, crime,\" said the Bunnyman. \"Like it's a crime to live.\"\n\"For some it is.\"\nThe Bunnyman sighed, shook his head. \"Then was bunnies what killed your lass.\"\n\"Lass and a daughter. It ain't no right thing, outliving a child.\"\n\"I know that,\" said the Bunnyman his eyes glazing off in the distance. \"I'd do anythin for mine.\"\n\"Guess you didn't do enough.\"\nThe Bunnyman stared at Jack.\n\"Sorry, but it's true, ain't it?\"\n\"I would have died for him,\" said the Bunnyman, slow and careful. \"If I'd had the chance. What about you?\"\n\"I'd have died too,\" said Jack. \"But it wouldn't have done any good.\"\n\"Aye,\" said the Bunnyman bleakly. \"Hell. Won't make any difference if I tell you, all that's done now? Famine and a world five years gone?\"\nKillin Jack just watched him.\n\"Nah, reckoned not,\" said the Bunnyman, standing, stretching his long rabbity legs out for springing. \"You sure I ain't got nothin on you?\"\nJack smiled sadly. \"There ain't been one that had a thing, not since I was cursed them five years back.\"\n\"Cursed,\" said the Bunnyman, \"aye, seems a right way to say it.\"\n\"So you fighting? Or you had enough?\"\nThe Bunnyman breathed in deep, tasted the air, let it out. \"Reckon I'll fight, like as not. Never been a lie down die sort of bloke.\"\n\"You ain't even armed.\"\n\"That don't hardly matter now does it?\"\nJack sighed. \"It don't,\" he said, \"but I'll go fair on ye and play it the same way all the same.\"\n\"That'd be neighbourly.\"\n\"I always been neighbourly,\" said Jack, wrenching the graveyard railings apart, stepping through the twisted iron gap.\n\"Bury us too, will ye?\" asked the Bunnyman, standing his ground. \"Wouldn't do for folk to see us all splayed round the yard.\"\n\"Aye,\" said Jack, striding through the graves, \"I'll do it.\"\nThe Bunnyman nodded. Then he flashed claws, bared his teeth, and bounded roaring down the graves.\nJack caught the scruff of his chest, the jut of his chin, and tore his head right off his shoulders. He held both parts up as the blood drained clear, the red light glimming out of the Bunnyman's eyes, then he set them down on the grass, picked up the shovel, and started to dig.\nCome the dawn he was perched on a gargoyle's head, looking out over the city. The Sun-smelter's core in the East was smoking up a pally storm, blacking out half the Levi river. Trains shuttled round and about the city bi-rails and land-lines, and down below like ants the first couple of street-mongers were rousing for the days shouting and selling.\nJack sat and watched while the city woke up, picking at the specks of dried blood and dirt on his hands.\nAfter a time, the sun risen up and bright across the roofing, he heard a cry from behind.\nHe hopped off his mount and paced the burnished copper rooftop back to the graveyard, lit up gory come the light, following the cry. through the railings, past the marble stones, and down by the fresh mounding where the Bunny and his bairn lay inhumed.\nA baby bunny head was pushed through the loose earth, yawling. Pink and shivering, long slender ears all hairless and shiny in the morning light, it sprayed dirt in mounds round its strong forelegs until it flopped loose and free onto the graveyard deck, white swaddling blankets left underground.\nKillin Jack strode over, knelt by the quivering baby's side.\n\"Looks like your pa died for you after all,\" he said.\nThe baby gurgled, and smiled.\nJack reached down and plucked it up.\nKillin Jack walked the Slumswelters, shadows hanging like funeral dirges round its bombed out old buildings and half-collapsed statuary, the street-way walls plastered over with long forgotten anti-Bunny posterage.\nBy a mildewed stone fountain in the center of the Slumswelter square he paused, dropped a cuffed sleeve in the rust-pitted stone bowl, sloshed the water clear of its dusty surface scum, and damped down the cloth.\nThe baby yewled in the bulging crook of his arm. Killin Jack held the cloth to its lips, and it nuzzled, licked slow, then began to suckle.\nLow moanings slurred out from the Shabbath's guinnell, up top of the Swelter square. Drunken donegones and shabbelry lay out along the walkways. Killin Jack strode the cobbles, ignoring the faint whimperings reaching out from either side, heading deeper into the rubble of forgotten Swelterside.\nRound a tumbledown corner, paving slabs collapsed in on the sub-terran stopped up sewers, Killin Jack came to worn stone spiral stairs leading up. He started the climb.\nTen steps up and the Painman spoke.\n\"Killin Jack,\" he called, his burbling voice haunting down from transceivers hung high in the stone staircase. \"One step more, and I shoot.\"\nKillin Jack grunted and climbed, eying the crossbow slits in the tubing wall.\n\"Last warning,\" came the echoey voice again.\nJack strode on up, stepping over bone shellings and snippets of leathery skin strewn over the splintery weed-sprung stair-blocks.\n\"Alright,\" came the voice, and then a whooshing thock as a crossbow released and struck Jack in the side. He pitched a little, staggered, then held the baby in closer, covered it with his broad forearm, and kept going up.\nThere were more swooshes, thocks, but Jack did not stop. At the top he strode an empty corridor, torch sconces limp and hanging loose by single screws, all in shadow but for a red glow round the Painman's door.\nJack entered the Painman's room, saw the Painman all white and flinching, hung up in his viscous yellow fat vat embedded in the laboratory wall, rows of levers under his hands, leering odd smile on his face.\n\"I made you too well,\" he said, jaw moving under the air-tube strapped to his face, sound pealing out of the amplifying racks hung over his chemical strewn Mogrifying laboratory.\n\"You've been busy,\" said Jack, pointing to a row of males sleeping and strapped to chassis workbenches, pinioned wrist and ankle, half-opened up at the leg or the waist or the neck. Twisted branches of sinew flued out randomly, held up by various metal clamps.\nThe Painman swam to the surface of his glass vat and pushed his clammy head over the rim, slipping free the air-tube transceivers.\n\"There's always them that'll pay,\" he said, voice weaker minus the relays.\nKillin Jack nodded, strode the length of the lab, uneven tables either side of him laden down with yellow formaldehyde pitchers filled with various guts, brains, embryos.\nThe Painman swung his blotchy white body over the vat's lip and climbed down the ladder to the ground, gobbets of fat splatting over the floor at his feet.\nJack looked up. \"You're losing juice,\" he said.\nThe Painman hawked and spat, then shook the fat free from his arms, rubbed it down off his torso and legs. \"I don't trust you here,\" he said.\n\"I know,\" said Jack, stopping by one large man, his ribcage splintered open with a vice, heart and lungs pumping brightly purple through dust. \"This one's got maggots.\"\n\"He'll eat them,\" said the Painman. \"He's a Malakite.\"\nJack looked up. \"You're building more Malakites?\" he asked.\nThe Painman nodded. \"I'm always building somethin,\" he said.\nJack reached into the Malakite's ribbed cage and squeezed the heart until it burst. Blood flumed up his forearm.\n\"Not any more,\" said Jack.\nThe benched Malakite gave a sigh, and died, organs immediately shriveling to grey and black.\nThe Painman opened his mouth, closed it. Jack shook his bloody hand free of torn flesh.\n\"What do you want?\" asked the Painman.\nJack un-tucked the baby bunny from beneath his ruffled cloak, sat it snuffling on a vellum shed worktop.\n\"What's that?\" asked the Painman.\n\"It's a baby,\" said Jack. \"Bunny baby.\"\nThe Painman hobbled his weak white limbs closer, peering over the flax and wriggle of the silken little rabbit on his countertop. \"So it is,\" he said, then looked up at Jack. \"I wonder why it isn't dead yet?\"\n\"His pa died for him,\" said Jack. \"Didn't seem right endin it straight off.\"\nThe Painman chuckled. \"That's some trouble you got then, eh? How are you going to kill any more when it stops seeming fair?\"\n\"There ain't no more killin needs doin,\" said Jack. \"He's the last.\"\nThe Painman's eyebrows lifted. \"Quick work,\" he said. \"A whole race in, what, just a few years?\"\n\"I just cleaned up the city,\" said Jack. \"Might be some in the outlands.\"\nThe Painman shrugged. \"If there is, they aren't a danger to us now.\"\nJack nodded. \"Wish the lot of em had just taken that route.\"\n\"Plenty did,\" said the Painman, turning over a baby bunny ear, checking the underside. \"These really are remarkably soft, you know.\"\n\"He's a pretty little thing, aye,\" said Jack.\n\"And that's what the ladies will say, when he's grown in a few years,\" said the Painman. \"Five at the outside and he'll repopulate the city. Six and we\u2019ll be mass famining again, I guess.\"\n\"Aye,\" said Jack. \"They do multiply.\"\n\"Not any more though,\" said the Painman. \"Thanks to you.\"\nJack watched the Painman. \"We each had our own way,\" he said.\n\"I could have saved them, Jack,\" said the Painman, sad smile on his lank face, looking up from the bunny. \"If you hadn't stopped bringing them to me.\"\n\"You made them sick in the first place,\" said Jack. \"There weren't no saving them past extinction.\"\n\"You don't know that, Jack. They could've changed.\"\n\"Like you've changed?\" asked Jack. \"Promising to quit out on meddling, and what's this, a room full of Malakites.\"\n\"It isn't the same thing.\"\n\"It ain't no different, Painman. Eggs is eggs, and bunnies rut. Malakites kill. An you just keep on stirring the pot.\"\nThe Painman smiled. \"We've had this argument before,\" he said. \"I'm just doing what I can, to save what I can.\"\n\"You been workin to save yourself,\" said Jack. \"We've been through this.\"\n\"I'll not debate you again,\" said the Painman.\n\"Aye, we're past debate,\" said Jack.\nA moment passed. The bunny baby rolled onto its side, and laughed. The sound echoed weirdly round the Mogrifying lab.\n\"So what do you want, then?\" asked the Painman.\n\"I think you know,\" said Jack.\nThe Painman shook his head. \"You promised.\"\n\"So did you.\"\n\"Come on Jack,\" said the Painman, taking a step back. \"Things have changed. All I'm trying for now is a cure. I swear. I'm not reproducin. I'm not even teachin.\"\nKillin Jack shook his head. \"You've lied before,\" he said. \"We said no more. Malakites, bunnies, whatever. But you keep on.\"\n\"Hey,\" said the Painman. \"You've got arrows in your gut, still. Let me take them out. You'll feel different after that.\"\n\"After I gone under the knife? Not this time, Painman. It ain't meant to go that way.\"\n\"You'll kill all my Malakites too, won't you?\"\nJack nodded. \"Outside this lab, they're all gone already,\" he said.\n\"S'just me left. And I'm readying for walkabout soon enough.\"\n\"Well take me that way then, too. Me you and the babe, it'll be like old times.\"\n\"There was no old times no more,\" said Jack. \"Only you lyin. And buildin.\"\nThe Painman shook his head. \"It ain't meant to be like this,\" he said, backing up to the fat vat slowly, climbing up the ladder rungs. \"It ain't, Jack. You don't kill your pa.\"\n\"There can't be no more Malakites, and no more bunnies,\" said Jack, approaching softly. \"And walkabout won't quit out the machinations of your mind. Reproducin natural was never an issue.\"\n\"It isn't right,\" said the Painman, up the ladder, wet skin sliming against the glass, flopping over the trim and into the lipidic suds. \"It isn't fair.\"\n\"That's what my lass said about the famine,\" said Jack, stalking the fat vat, as the Painman hauled on his face tubules, started up the stream of air and logged into the speakers. \"She still died.\"\n\"This isn't the same,\" said the Painman, hanging in the juice, his voice tinny through the transceivers. \"You don't have to. Please. I want to live.\"\n\"I can't help you with that no more,\" said Jack, and punched a hole straight through the vat glass. The Painman's scream lodged in the transceivers and yelped out until Jack's roving arm sought out his neck and snapped it clean broke.\nThen he stepped back, slicked off the lumpy curds from his massive arms, and turned to the lab. Malakites were growing on table tops before him, wires and tubes and a sussurus of artificial breathing.\nJack walked the aisles squinching hearts to burst until not a one was left. Then he took up the babe, nestled it into the dry bulge of his massive left arm, and left.\nJack stood on the brink of a red-rusted water drum stanchioned out over the Levi river, babe in his arm, looking down at the turgid brown waters rolling by beneath.\n\"It ain't the end,\" said Jack softly to the babe. \"Don't look at it like it's the end cos it's not. Your pa's waiting. All kinds o' folks is waitin.\"\nThe baby snuggled in Jack's massive grip.\n\"Even I got folks waitin,\" said Jack. Then he stepped up to the edge.\nThere were dead bunnies sitting out on the frozen Levi the day his wife and child died. Tucked under the piereages and mounded round the water pumps, naked, some of them shaved bald, some of them burnt in haphazard pyres.\nJack was walking the banks. The Bodyswell healers line was ragged with black sheets off to his left, a mass moaning rising like smoke from the waiting sick.\nAcross his back there was a sack-cloth bag half-full with the scavengings of the past two days. Molding crumbs and livery slivers of goose-meat. A thin vial of oil and some salt crustings he'd picked off a dock-side quay ring. A half sprig of squabbled grapes and 3 rotten potatoes.\nHis head ached, and he felt weak.\nHe walked back down the banks and into the Slum-swelters, moon shadows dappled too harsh cross the winter-bit stone flags. People trudged by to his left and right, some mumbling, some steaming heat off into the night. Others lay still and huddled together against lattice rod huts, rags hung for walls, children splayed round their mothers like runts of the litter rousting for a sip.\nAcross the square and down Shabbath's guinnell he walked by the corpse of noseless Mrs. Dimble his neighbour. Her naked blue body was stick-thin and frozen hard to the icy cobbles. He tried to pry her up, but she wouldn\u2019t budge.\nThe air was fresh. Jack breathed it in. It hurt his lungs, and he walked on.\nStanding in his home, shelled out and everything sold for food or fuel, he saw Delilah and Mary wrapped up together, Mrs. Dimble's clothes thrown over their blankets and hay, not moving any more. Frost had drifted up to their feet on the bare stone floor.\nThere was a crusty hank of bread on the table, covered over with the cornflower blue napkin she'd made for him a long time before.\nHe sat down, dropped the empty pack. He moved the napkin, took up the bread, and staring at his dead wife and child, numb, began to eat.\nThe next morning, the Grammaton clock-tower ringing nothing but silence, Jack was out digging up cobbles from the Swelter-square, laying down the last of the wood from his home on the hard brown ground, and lighting a fire.\nThe Painman watched from the buzzing warmth of his fat vat, windowed out over the fake balconies of his turreted Mogrifying lab. He saw the fire, and Jack dragging out a woman and a child, reverent, laying them on the ground, waiting.\nThe slow dawn was silent. Jack sat on the mossy fountain's edge, stone tribute to some long gone pauper prince. Hours passed, until the sun sat high in the blue-white sky, and Jack stepped to the fire, slat board in hand, and began to dig.\nThe Painman watched Jack work the ground. It was nightfall again by the time the hole was big enough for Jack to lay the bodies in. He dropped the blue napkin in over, and piled on the dirt. After the dirt, the cobbles again.\nThen he sat at the fountainside, stripped to the waist, steam turning to frost on his skin, and didn't move.\nThe Painman sent his servants down.\nJack woke up strapped to a table. It was warm, and a golden man with long lank hair and shiny skin was standing over him.\n\"It's alright,\" said the Painman. \"Everything's alright now.\"\nIt was spring when he learnt how to speak again, started to control his new body, held up on crutches, lolling round the Painman's Mogrifying lab, cooing babyfaces at the caged animals round the walls.\nLater, an evening, time blurring like Jack's blood mingling in tubes overhead, he was sitting with the Painman, eating thinly sliced pork, looking down on the Swelter-square through rose-tinted arrow slits.\n\"You remember your wife?\" asked the Painman.\nJack grunted. He could speak, but he didn't.\n\"I think you do,\" said the Painman. \"You're looking at the spot you buried her. By the fountain. You had to light a fire. Remember?\"\n\"It was cold,\" said Jack.\n\"It was very cold, that's right,\" said the Painman. \"But they didn't die of the cold. It was the famine that did it.\"\nJack took a bite of gingered pork.\n\"You know the Bunnymen, Jack? Did you ever hear of the Bunnymen?\"\n\"There were bodies at the river,\" said Jack. \"Dead bunnies.\"\n\"And a good thing,\" said the Painman. \"A cull, for they were too many.\"\nJack looked up, his massive neck smooth and strong. \"Everybody was dying,\" he said.\n\"And you know why, don't you?\"\n\"I don't remember,\" said Jack.\n\"I made them, Jack. But I made them wrong.\"\n\"Wrong,\" said Jack.\n\"They made too many babies. That was never meant to be the way of it. Then winter came, and there was no food. Because of them, your family died.\"\n\"They killed my wife?\"\n\"And your child. Though they didn't mean it.\"\n\"It was still cruel,\" said Jack.\nPainman in the long turret hallway, throwing stones at Jack's face. Jack batted them away with a massive iron mace.\n\"They'll throw worse than this at you, Jack,\" said the Painman. \"You should remember that.\"\n\"I will,\" said Jack.\n\"They won't want to die,\" said the Painman. \"They're not like you.\"\n\"I don't want to die,\" said Jack.\n\"Of course you don't, my son,\" said the Painman. \"Of course you don't.\"\n\"Why did you make them?\" asked Jack.\nThe Painman smiled. \"I was looking for cures,\" he said, \"experiments. To help people.\"\n\"Good things,\" said Jack.\n\"Yes, good things, Jack.\"\n\"Why do you want the bodies?\"\n\"To fix them, Jack. Cure them. So they don't hurt others, like your family.\"\n\"They killed my family.\"\n\"They did. And they'll do it again, if we don't stop them.\"\n\"I miss Delilah,\" said Jack.\n\"Delilah was your wife?\"\n\"I miss Mary too.\"\n\"I'm sure they miss you too.\"\n\"When will we start?\"\n\"We'll start soon, Jack. We'll start soon.\"\nHis first was in the Boomfire whore's quarter, a Bunny lass finishing up a client on the second floor of a pimping joint named the Yailing Chain. Jack had watched her for days. She had beautiful fur, and her eyes gleamed in the dark. She wore yellow bonnets in the morning and a grey scarf in the evening. She smoked Spurgsroot cigarettes on the balcony while her pimp took payment.\nThe Grammaton rang in the distance, and her pimp towed the client downstairs for money.\nJack leapt to the balcony, swung up and over the rail. She stepped out, saw the giant bulk of Jack, raveled over with belts and weapons and leather. Before she could scream, Jack hoisted her beautiful body to his shoulder, jumped from the decking, and fled into the night.\nBack at the Mogrifying lab, the Painman spent all night cutting her open on his rickety bench-slab, stewing out the jellied bits and pieces that made her alive. She screamed at first, then fell silent, turning white as the blood drained from her. Finally, she died. The Painman dropped her pieces in slop buckets, took fluid samples in little glass tubules, stored, separated, and made marks on a chart, while Jack stood by and watched.\nBy dawn her body had been reduced to a grisly array of bloody bunny strips, hanging from the dusty timbelry rafters. The Painman at last set down his instruments, yellow skin sweat drenched and weak. He collapsed in his chair.\n\"Put me in the vat,\" he gasped at Jack, who hoisted him like a rag doll, tenderly fed him into the turgid fat, strapped on his tubules and transceivers like a father tending to a child.\n\"It wasn't right,\" said the Painman eventually, voice ringing tinny through the echo boxes.\n\"I don't understand,\" said Jack. \"I don't understand why you did that.\"\n\"A cure, Jack,\" said the Painman. \"I'm looking for a cure.\"\n\"But I thought it was in their heads,\" said Jack. \"The multiplyin, I thought you could fix it.\"\n\"It's not just in their heads, Jack,\" said the Painman. \"They can't help it. It's in their nature.\"\n\"Where's that?\" asked Jack. \"Is that in their guts?\"\n\"No Jack.\"\n\"Well is it in their skin?\" asked Jack. \"Is it in their brain? Is it in their fur?\"\nThe Painman sighed. \"I don't know,\" he said.\n\"So why did you cut her up like that? Why did you make her scream?\"\n\"Because it's the right thing to do,\" said the Painman. \"It's the only way to help them.\"\n\"It didn't help her,\" said Jack, pointing up at the eviscerated body of the she-bunny. \"It hurt her. Now she's dead.\"\n\"It might help the others though,\" said the Painman. \"If I can change them, then nobody more needs to die. There'll be no more famines. Everything will be like it used to.\"\n\"My family won't come back,\" said Jack.\n\"No, they won't, Jack.\"\n\"She won't come back.\"\n\"No,\" said the Painman, and shook his head.\nJack thought about this.\n\"I wish you'd never made them,\" said Jack. \"I wish they'd never existed.\"\n\"But they do,\" said the Painman. \"And we have to try and fix it. We have to find the cure.\"\nA moment passed.\n\"It ain't right,\" said Jack.\n\"What?\"\n\"This,\" said Jack, waving at the dead bunny pieces, the Mogrifying lab, his own distorted bulk. \"It ain't the way it's meant to be.\"\n\"Jack,\" said the Painman.\n\"If Delilah saw this, she'd scream.\"\n\"Delilah isn't here,\" said the Painman.\n\"No,\" said Jack, stepping up to the Painman's face against the glass, looming over him, \"she ain't.\"\nThe Painman pushed back into the fat.\n\"You did wrong,\" said Jack. \"Making me. Making them.\"\n\"I know,\" said the Painman, \"I never lied about that. I'm trying to fix it.\"\n\"You did wrong.\"\nThe Painman opened his mouth, closed it.\n\"I'm gonna set it right,\" said Jack.\nThe Painman coughed wetly, spat out a gob of something black into the roiling suds. His skin was glazing and his eyes goggled weirdly in their sockets. \"How?\"\nJack didn't answer. He just stared into the glass at the Painman, slackening in his traces and close to collapse.\n\"How?\" asked the Painman again. But Jack was already gone.\nHe killed his first that night. Top of the Haversall, a lone bunny walking home drunk. Jack cut his head clean off before he could even scream.\nJack was happy at that. Though he wept the whole night through after.\nThe next night he killed two.\nThe other Malakites came for him in the winter. They crept up on him round the zeppelin spike at the Firehark docking rings. He'd already dropped two bunnies trying to board the float out of the city. He was rounding the observation deck when the first bolt hit him in the spine.\nHis legs fell out from underneath him, the orange glow of the city's revelatories lurched upwards, his head mashed on the bronze railing stripe, and for a second he must have blacked out, as when he came to there were three massive Malakites standing around him, and two more fat, feathered bolts sticking out of his chest.\n\"From the Painman,\" said one, and plunged a spear into Jack's gut. Another crossbow bolt flew into his right eye and half the world went black. In the thin gap remaining, Jack saw a chrome scimitar descending.\nHe realized the Painman was trying to kill him.\nHe batted wildly at the scimitar, switching the arc so that it sank and lodged in his shoulder. With his other hand he tore the crossbow bolt from his eye and flung it up through the fleshy jaw of the crossbow carrying Malakite, punching up through his skull and killing him instantly.\nThe Malakites started shouting. The scimitar sucked out of his flesh, and the spear twisted in his gut.\nJack rolled to his side so the gutting spear snapped off inside his body, grabbed the heel of the scimitar wielding Malakite's left leg, and punched through the knee, buckling it back and dropping him screaming to the ground. He rolled over the flailing body, crushed the windpipe, then snatched up the scimitar from his slackening hand. He came to rest with the last Malakite standing over him, looking still puzzled at the broken spear in his hands.\n\"But the Painman said...\" he managed, before Jack scimitar-swept his legs free from his body, and he lopped down to the ground.\n\"What did the Painman say?\" growled Jack, coughing blood. He dragged himself over to the wailing Malakite, but the Malakite only screamed, and the sound echoed in Jack's head like a crying baby so that he pinched the neck shut and the screaming ended.\nHe lay there for a time.\nTime passed.\nHe faded some, came back again. He saw the moon, yellow and grinning above him. He felt the blood leaking out of his hollowed waist, his vacuous eye, the pain coursing through him. He wondered at the thoughts of his victims, as they died themselves. Then he remembered, the Painman had tried to kill him.\nAnd he began to crawl.\nIt was morning when he reached the Mogrifying lab, the night a long memory of cold cobbles and pain behind him. The Painman was sleeping in his fat vat. Jack climbed the ladder, legs trailing useless behind, and dropped into the vat. He pried clear the breathing struts from the Painman's face, and wrapped a hand round the Painman's neck.\nThe Painman woke, tried to scream into the fat. Jack punched out the glass, and they flooded out with the viscous fluid, to lie gasping entwined on the laboratory floor. The Painman flopped weakly in Jack's oaken grip, then stopped, sighed, Jack staring into his eyes.\n\"I didn't,\" began the Painman, but Jack squeezed him silent. They lay together, Painman's breaths whistling through his crushing neck, Jack staring. Then he spoke.\n\"Fix me,\" he said.\nSurgery lasted three days. Jack held on to the Painman's neck or arm or leg throughout, conscious while his spine was rebuilt, his guts, a new eye. When it was done, Jack tied him up, dropped him in the puddled bottom of the fat vat, and went to sleep.\nA week later Jack woke. He slid off the table and went over to the Painman, feebled and wilting and supping on curdled fat, shrouded with flies.\n\"No more Malakites,\" said Jack, standing over him, voice hoarse with disuse.\nThe Painman nodded rabidly.\n\"You'll live,\" said Jack. \"That's it.\"\nThe Painman grinned weakly. Jack tore his bonds free. Then he was gone.\nThe river sworled by beneath them, Jack and the baby up top of the water drum, shifting in the warm night wind. Cries from the Bodyswell line drifted from behind them. The smell of hickaberry scones hung sweet upon the air. Shellaby bugs glimmered softly across the far banks.\n\"Y'are a cute one though,\" said Jack, down to the purring bunny in his arms. He stroked its chin, and it googled happily. \"Many many lasses you'll have, no doubt about that.\"\nThe baby turned in his arms, warm little head pressed up against Jack's chest. Soon it closed its eyes, and fell asleep.\n\"You'll see your pa soon,\" said Jack.\nThe river eddied by underneath, sucking at the rust-pitted drum stanchions, rocking up the banks.\nJack bent over, kissed the bunny on the ears. Then he looked up, scanned the spreading city one last time.\n\"I'm coming, Delilah,\" he said. Then he took his last breath, his last step, and fell down to the river.\nThe thick brown waters of the Levi closed over his body.\nSomewhere in the distance, the Grammaton rang out for All Hallows.\nAnd the river flowed on.\nMichael John Grist lives in Tokyo and keeps himself busy writing, teaching, and watching TV.\nIn his free time he plays ultimate frisbee, power-kites, kick-boxes, and checks out new music.\nHis blog can be found at manfalling.com, with stories about his life, adventures, and writing.\n|\n|\n______\n|\n||\n|\n______","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}

But that\u2019s not really what I\u2019m asking and Jessica, in her infinitely obstinate teenage wisdom, is well aware of it.\n\u201cMiss Jessica\u2026\u201d\nThe welding rod snaps off, the visor snaps up, and Jessica turns her precocious, pimpled face to mine. \u201cLook, Pandy,\u201d she says, in that haughty, Too British voice she learnt to mimic from watching back-to-back episodes of Are You Being Served. \u201cMom says\u2014I mean, Mummy says I don\u2019t have to answer to you.\u201d Her chin\u2019s out now, her lower lip quaking ever so slightly. \u201cI don\u2019t need some stupid butler telling me what to do. I mean maybe I have like, stuff I want to see in history. Like, that\u2019s totally about me, personally. What are you, a school counsellor? You don\u2019t know anything!\u201d\nI sigh. \u201cIs it a boy?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Yes. Shut up! How did you know that?\u201d\nHow? Because you\u2019re a teenage girl. But I don\u2019t say it out loud. I\u2019ve been a butler for more than a decade, and in this business you quickly learn when to keep your mouth shut. (Although considering the confessions of Paul Burrell, your mileage may vary.) I sit down on an old wicker chair that Jessica has dug out of the summer house and examine her half-baked creation, steaming and hissing in the midday sunlight like a huge, neon-lit kettle.\nButtling for the British is easy, who consider it a colonial right of sorts, but it makes Americans uncomfortable; they have a residual ancestral guilt over things like black slavery, Native American genocide and Gangsta rap. I\u2019m well aware that the Pemberley-Westons\u2014who were the plain old Parkwells before Mr P-W made his fortune in the engineering market and Mrs P-W invented the suctionless vacuum\u2014only hired me for the sake of their social image. When in Britain, do as the Britons do, and so on.\nUnfortunately, the P-Ws aren\u2019t very good at being buttled for. Mrs P-W, who prides herself on being a homemaker, likes to run the house without interference, while Mr P-W is loudly confident he can find everything there is to know about British social etiquette on Ask Jeeves.com. Which leaves me with little to do except serve as a nanny to fifteen-year-old Jessica, who tolerates my intrusions into her life with marginally more grace than her parents do.\n\u201cAn educated guess, Miss Jessica,\u201d I say, wondering vaguely where she managed to get all that scrap metal from. Perhaps there\u2019s some HMS warship in Portsmouth missing its hull. \u201cAre you trying to impress him, then? Is this some manner of intellectual challenge?\u201d\n\u201cImpress him? It\u2019s just a stupid conflation of Hawking and parallel universe theory. Like, sooo H.G. Wells, not.\u201d Jessica slaps a dismissive hand against the time machine\u2019s round-bellied door, and the little neon bulbs inset in its hinge blink in sequence. The entire Pemberley-Weston family are geniuses and Jessica is no exception. It\u2019s a blood thing, I think. Genius-ness\u2014geniosity?\u2014runs through the P-Ws veins like haemophilia through the old royal family. \u201cAnyway I don\u2019t actually have a him yet. I mean he doesn\u2019t even know I exist. But when I get him, Hortense is going to be sooo jealous.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cLike, Hortense from school? See she\u2019s dating Viscount Hopkins who is such a drag but he\u2019s got a title, right, and Jemima Parker-Hamilton is practically engaged to some prince from Africa and Susanna is with Sir something\u2019s son, you know, the one who saved all those starving children with music, duh, and they\u2019re always talking about their boyfriends and I\u2019m like, sooo bored of listening. So obviously I need a boyfriend who is, like, way better than theirs and will make them totally go green. Someone Totally Posh who\u2019ll defend my honour and be filthy rich and have dinner parties and stuff.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been reading Jane Austen, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re studying it in English, it is like sooo true.\u201d\nThat\u2019s what I like about Jessica Pemberley-Weston and, generally, all Americans\u2014they\u2019re practical. They\u2019re A-to-B people. When they want something, they aim to get it by the most direct route possible. The British procrastinate, which is why we ended up with tragic heroes like Hamlet and Macbeth while the Americans got hardboiled gunslingers like Sam Spade and Dirty Harry. You wouldn\u2019t catch a British girl building a time machine to find a Totally Posh boyfriend to annoy her Totally Boring school-friends with. But an American? For Jessica, with all that P-W genius-blood bubbling in her veins, it\u2019s the only practical thing to do.\nNot that I believe for a minute that she\u2019s actually done it. Sooo HG Wells is right\u2014time travel is pure science fiction. I steeple my fingers and put on my best humouring-Jessica face. \u201cI\u2019m not sure Mrs Pemberley-Weston would like it if you went gallivanting about the Regency era.\u201d\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s okay, she\u2019s always like, Jessica, you should find a nice boyfriend, when are you bringing home a boy...?\u201d She frets for a moment over an ugly knot of recently-welded metal, her gloved fingers testing and squeezing at its rough edge like she\u2019s brooding over an unpopped zit. \u201cAnyway Mom\u2014Mummy\u2014Mother thinks Wells is like, the best writer ever.\u201d\n\u201cDo you want me to come with you?\u201d\nJessica wrinkles her nose. \u201cEw, like as a chaperone? No way!\u201d\n\u201cMrs Pemberley-Weston would probably\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOkay, fine! I promise I\u2019ll bring him straight home so Mummy and Daddy can meet him,\u201d Jessica huffs, shoving her gloved hands as deep into the pockets of her overalls as she can. \u201cJust leave me alone now, Pandy. I\u2019m almost finished the welding and you are like, such a distraction.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly, Miss Jessica.\u201d\nThus dismissed, I head back to the P-W\u2019s stately pile, stepping carefully over and around the various power tools Jessica has left lying about the gardens. As a mere butler, it\u2019s not really my place to question the actions of my employees\u2014or their daughters\u2014but sometimes I would definitely like to.\nI meet Jessica\u2019s self-styled Mr Darcy that evening. I\u2019m in the dining room organising the P-Ws\u2019 engraved cutlery when the littlest lady of the house flounces in with her new (or should that be old?) beau. He\u2019s a small overfed youth with a freckled face and sour-cream complexion, rather froggish about the eyes and throat. I have to admit the pair of them have done a good job with the costuming\u2014it\u2019s perfect BBC traditional, with a ruffled shirt, broad-cuffed jacket and those waistless pants that grip the thighs just that smidgen too tightly. His shoes have silver buckles on them that shine the way I wish my silver would.\nFrankly I think Jessica, for all her spots, could do better, but this is another situation to which the keeping-my-mouth-shut rule applies.\n\u201cOhhhhhh Pandy!\u201d gurgles Jessica delightedly. \u201cI want you to meet someone suuuper special.\u201d\nOn the inside, I\u2019m groaning. On the outside: \u201cI\u2019m honoured, Miss Jessica.\u201d\n\u201cI bet you like, thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to do it,\u201d she crows, gesturing at the mini-Darcy as if he\u2019s an amazing palaeontologic treasure and not, say, a short fat boy in fancy dress. \u201cI brought him back from like, the seventeenth century. It was sooo smelly there and everyone was like, posh as anything. They were all bowing and hand-kissing, we did waltzing and everything. Wasn\u2019t it brilliant, Charles?\u201d\nShe turns to look at the Darcy, whose froggy eyes are cold with ill-temper. \u201cYou are introducing me to your butler?\u201d he asks.\nThe accent is pretty good. Not very BBC, admittedly, but it has a touch of the midland-riche about it. And what\u2019s best is that he actually enunciates, pronounces each word as if he\u2019s patriotically proud of speaking the Queen\u2019s Own English. Although I suppose that could actually be the King\u2019s Own, depending on which year he\u2019s pretending to be from.\n\u201cDuh,\u201d Jessica tells him. \u201cIt\u2019s like modern ages. Duhhhh.\u201d\n\u201cAh, pardon me.\u201d The Darcy bows formally, sincerely. \u201cI am pleased to make your acquaintance, Master Pandy.\u201d\nShame on me for encouraging their games, but I find myself bowing in return. \u201cMy lord.\u201d Which is laying it on rather thick, although the Darcy doesn\u2019t see the humour, and Jessica is too hopped up on new-boyfriend glee to notice.\nI\u2019m on the verge of asking the Darcy about the weather in Regency England, when the two elder Pemberley-Westons enter the dining room, Mrs P-W carrying a bowl of the traditional family favourite, macaroni cheese. She\u2019s wearing her usual about-the-house clothes: short skirt, ridiculous heels and a sleeveless top that makes the most of her considerably costly cleavage\u2014she\u2019s that kind of woman. One look at her and the Darcy recoils like a tomcat before a hose, actually hissing in horror. He\u2019s overdoing the Regency thing a bit now, but at least he hasn\u2019t broken character yet.\n\u201cChin up, man,\u201d I advise him, making some final adjustments to the tablecloth before taking my leave. Usually I eat in the kitchen while the family \u2018breaks bread\u2019, to give them some privacy, but today I\u2019ve got a touch of the Burrell in me. I\u2019d really like to know how Jessica plans to justify the paradoxes of time-travel to a celebrated engineer and a quantum physicist. Standing in the corridor, my ear pressed to the ornate double doors, I\u2019m just in time to hear the Darcy loose his cool.\n\u201cLady, you are immodest!\u201d\n\u201cAw ducky, don\u2019t fret. It\u2019s only me wee legs. I bet your mummy has legs too.\u201d Mrs P-W has what they call a blended accent: one part Noo Yawk drawl, two parts Corrie-Enders cockney.\n\u201cI beg your pardon? My mother would never clothe herself in such a wanton\u2014\u201c\n\u201cCharlie, shut up. It\u2019s like, the future. That\u2019s what women wear.\u201d\n\u201cDisgraceful!\u201d\n\u201cIs this a new friend, mm, Jessie? What\u2019s his name then?\u201d\n\u201cHis name\u2019s Charles Chamberlain, Daddy, and he\u2019s from 1812.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice. Do you go to school around here, then, Charles?\u201d\n\u201cDaaaa-dddy! He\u2019s from the past, of course he doesn\u2019t. Duh.\u201d\n\u201cTheo, honey, they\u2019re playing a little game, we\u2019re meant to play along. Didn\u2019t you read the Living with Teenagers website I bookmarked for you? They\u2019re just going through a phase.\u201d\n\u201cMummmy, you\u2019re being like soooo embarrassing in front of Charles!\u201d\n\u201cGood grief, will someone give that woman something to wear?\u201d It seems that the Darcy is appealing to the universe at this stage, the P-Ws being largely unresponsive.\n\u201cSonny, that\u2019s enough from you. I know my daughter probably put you up to this but I won\u2019t tolerate any boy in my household disrespecting my wife.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god, Daddy, I swear this moment is seriously going to be the one that I tell my shrink about when he like, asks me at exactly what point you totally ruined my life forever.\u201d\n\u201cBoobs, ducky, they\u2019re just boobs. Everyone\u2019s Mom has boobs, every baby\u2019s got to suckle somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cMummy, you\u2019re being even more embarrassing! When I tell Hortense she\u2019s going to be all, like, no way your Mom said that. And I\u2019ll be like, oh you have like nooo idea, they are like the worst\u2014\u201d\n\u201cEnough,\u201d shrieks the Darcy, whose voice has gradually been rising up the register and has peaked, here, at a startlingly prepubescent soprano. \u201cYou people are quite, quite intolerable! I knew I should have stayed in 1812.\u201d\nI leap back just in time, as the double-doors to the dining room swing back with a thud and the Darcy stamps past, his froggish eyes bulging and his sour-cream complexion piqued with red. Jessica is two steps behind him, arms outstretched, wailing platitudes, in much the same way I\u2019d expect Dr Frankenstein to go screaming after his errant monster. And that\u2019s the funny thing: during all this neither of them have broken character, have ditched the charade, have admitted, Okay, we thought this Regency thing would be good for a laugh, but I guess the joke\u2019s old now, so\u2026 Which is strange because Jessica has never been a good actor\u2014she\u2019s been a sheep or a tree in every school play since the first grade\u2014and she\u2019s also terrible at keeping secrets.\nAs the pair of them bellow their way down the corridor toward the manor\u2019s east wing, I start to get a weird feeling in my stomach, not butterflies but not bad-cottage-cheese-the-morning-after either. And it\u2019s a feeling I can\u2019t shake, even after popping half a tube of Pepto-Bismol. Jessica does this to me sometimes: she twists up my insides with worry, she makes me doubt.\nGirls\u2019 night starts at six o\u2019clock sharp every Saturday at Disco Chips, the coolest place in town for bored rich kids under the legal drinking age. Think strobe-lights, bad pop music, velour lounges, mirrored walls and cocktails whose strongest ingredient is Red Bull. If I had a choice in the matter I\u2019d never set foot in the place, but unfortunately that decision is out of my hands. I am, as always, the Designated Chaperone.\nThe place is run by Hortense\u2019s auntie\u2019s poolboy\u2019s grandfather\u2019s half-sister twice removed\u2014look, it\u2019s some equally illogical connection\u2014and Jessica and her school friends go there every week to gossip and do other fun \u2018girl things\u2019. Well, traditionally fun \u2018girl things\u2019. I rather suspect that Miss P-W is far happier mucking about in the garage with her mother\u2019s welding gear than she is drinking mocktails in a strobe-lit kiddie-bar, listening to Susanna Hampton-Burgess complain about her manicurist.\nBut this Saturday will be a little different, I\u2019ll bet, because this time Jessica has brought the Darcy.\nThe Darcy has become something of a fixture in the PW home, having taken up residence in one of the many guest rooms. One of the ones with a walk-in closet. Tonight he\u2019s dressed in full BBC regalia\u2014ruffled silk shirt, satin vest, swallow-tailed coat, et al.\u2014and amidst the sea of boob-tubes and designer jeans and henna tattoos he looks as out of place as an American in, well, London. How Jessica convinced him to dress up in public is a mystery to me, but he looks oddly comfortable, as if he\u2019s grown used to it. He fills out a pair of frilled knee-high stockings with pride, a pride no boy born this side of the \u201980s should possess.\n\u201cMiss Jessica, are you sure this is wise?\u201d I hiss in her ear, as we thread through the crowds. \u201cI understand you both want to make a point, but\u2026 look, the boy is wearing knickerbockers. The local hooligans will be drawing lots outside to pick which one of them gets to beat him up in the parking lot.\u201d\nJessica shrugs. \u201cThat\u2019s like, totally what he wanted to wear. Nothing to do with me, duh.\u201d\n\u201cMiss Jessica, having him pretend to be Mr Darcy was your idea, not his. He\u2019s only going along with it because of you.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god, Pandy\u2014do you like, totally never listen? Seriously, you, Mom and Dad\u2014Mummy and Daddy, I mean\u2014are like the slowest people in the universe. He\u2019s not pretending to be Mr Darcy, he\u2019s really Lord Charles Chamberlain from 1812, and he thinks he looks like, soooo cool in that gear because it was like, soooo cool in 1812.\u201d\n\u201cRight. Fine. Okay. Have it your way.\u201d I\u2019m clutching at straws. \u201cBut what do you think your friends will say?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I think they\u2019ll be like, super impressed. Hah! They\u2019d better be.\u201d\nThere\u2019s an ominous tone in her voice that I recognise all too well as a harbinger of Jessica Pemberley-Weston Getting Her Own Way, and I start wishing I\u2019d brought a bottle of Pepto-Bismol along.\nThe girls\u2014Hortense, Jemima and Susanna\u2014are seated at the Disco Chips bar on stools entirely too high to be practical. They\u2019re direly dull girls, this trio, three intellectual stooges, and I have to admit that I\u2019ve always wondered why Jessica, a girl who once built a particle accelerator out of three old washing machines and the engine of Mr P-W\u2019s old Mercedes, persists in hanging around them. But then I suppose that fake-tanned, air-headed brand of stupidity is considered cool these days, and Jessica, for all her genius, just wants to fit in.\nStirring their mocktails, the girls look at the Darcy dubiously as we approach.\n\u201cWho\u2019s the\u2026 uh, the guy,\u201d Jemima asks.\n\u201cAre we like on telly?\u201d Susanna reaches for her eyeliner.\nHortense Decourtenay-Davenport, a blubbery, pink-faced girl with unlikely blonde hair, curls her lip like one of her polo ponies. \u201cYou meet him at a fancy dress party or something?\u201d\nJessica smiles a tight smile. \u201cHortense, this is Charlie. The one I was like, telling you about.\u201d\n\u201cThis is Charlie? Oh my god.\u201d\n\u201cWhy oh my god?\u201d\n\u201cThis is the guy you were mooning over? He\u2019s a total minger,\u201d Hortense hoots, bursting into laughter. \u201cI mean he\u2019s like soooo dull compared to my boyfriend. That\u2019s Viscount Hopkins, by the way, he actually has a title\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMy name is Lord Charles Chamberlain,\u201d the Darcy interrupts. \u201cI, also, actually have a title. How odd that you should bring up the young Viscount Hopkins; I only recently heard that the poor boy\u2019s father has recently declared bankruptcy. Some embarrassing tax evasion business. The story even appeared in the papers\u2014well, I think it was buried somewhere near the back, between the Lonely Hearts column and that hilarious little comic about the orange cat and his impotent owner. The Hopkins family fortunes aren\u2019t exactly front page news.\u201d\nHortense goes pale, goes red, goes pale again.\n\u201cThat rude interjection aside, I\u2019m truly charmed to meet you all,\u201d says the Darcy, committing one of small bows. \u201cWhat wonderful company my Jessica keeps! Although I\u2019d expect nothing less. A young woman blessed with genius such as hers would surely associate with only the most astute and genteel members of her generation. I expect you all come from respectable families and are distinguished conversationalists.\u201d\nHe smiles. And suddenly it doesn\u2019t matter that he\u2019s wearing knickerbockers or that he\u2019s spotty or that his shoes have ridiculous silver buckles on them. There\u2019s class and there\u2019s class, and the Darcy and his Regency idiosyncrasies are the very height of class: that generation practically re-invented it. And it\u2019s that kind of class these girls feed on, that all of Britain is guilty of feeding on, those overdone and overworked Austens and Brontes and Eliots, with their stockings and their graces and their puffy dresses and even their bloody butlers\u2026\nJemima breaks the silence. \u201cOh my god he\u2019s like the best ever, Jess, where did you meet him?\u201d\n\u201cDoes he have a brother? I want to be a Lady Chamberlain.\u201d\nEven Hortense grudgingly joins in: \u201cHe talks brilliant, don\u2019t he? Like something out of Shakespeare, yeah?\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d says Jessica, completely flattered.\n\u201cYou all are truly too kind,\u201d the Darcy agrees. \u201cI\u2019m afraid my modesty won\u2019t permit me to let you go on. And, at any rate, I believe Miss Jessica and I have business to attend to. My lady,\u201d he finishes, dipping a knee, \u201cmight I have this dance?\u201d\n\u201cOhhhh, totally! Pandy, mind my purse?\u201d\nThe Darcy takes her hand, and they head to the dance floor. Together, amidst the booty-shakings of their peers, Jessica and her Darcy calmly waltz the night away.\nThree days later I find Jessica in her father\u2019s study, working on her laptop with her feet on his desk. Despite the size of the P-Ws\u2019 mansion, it\u2019s never hard to find her\u2014you just have to follow the trail of casually-discarded welding gear and the smell of burnt metal. Today she\u2019s in Inventing Mode: she\u2019s wearing the pink fireproof overalls Mrs P-W got her for her birthday, and has a pair of laboratory goggles dangling on elastic around her neck. Biochemistry books are piled about the desk, some fifty different How-To manuals for manipulating the genetic code.\n\u201cGood afternoon, Miss Jessica. I trust you\u2019re feeling well today?\u201d\n\u201cLike, duh.\u201d\n\u201cMarvellous to hear it. What is it you\u2019re up to?\u201d\n\u201cJust random stuff. Mapping the human genome, gene splicing, cyborgs, transhumanism. Like, sooo Philip K Dick.\u201d\nSometimes when she starts talking like that\u2014when any of the P-Ws start talking like that\u2014it\u2019s best to just move on. So long as she isn\u2019t using her genius to blow up the school, create a deadly super-virus or propel Hortense Decourtenay-Davenport and her pock-faced cronies into the sun, I don\u2019t care. \u201cThat sounds interesting,\u201d I lie, wondering if I have Harrison Ford and Blade Runner to thank for this latest obsession. \u201cAnd how is your boyfriend?\u201d\n\u201cWho, Charlie?\u201d Jessica glances up from the screen. \u201cWe broke up.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a surprise. \u201cI expect that pretending you were from 1812 could put a strain on any relationship.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re like sooo frustrating. I keep telling you, he totally came from the past. Didn\u2019t I like, show you the photos?\u201d She clicks a few keys and spins the laptop around to face me. \u201cNot that it matters. Charlie and me are like, seriously over. We like, had a fight, and I\u2019m totally not going to talk to him ever. I was like on the phone to Jemima and she was like, oh my god, you are like soooo too good for him and I\u2019m like, like duhhh. Regency guys have like one thing on their minds\u2014marriage.\u201d\n\u201cWait\u2026 photos?\u201d\n\u201cDaddy always tells me to like, document my discoveries otherwise some stupid chav will steal them. Remember Edison, he says. You don\u2019t want to be, like, Joseph Swan.\u201d\nBless this digital age, she\u2019s transported her Regency photos into a slideshow. I click through the images: dirty-faced peasants carrying outdated gardening equipment around a barren field; Jessica sitting in a parlour room, sipping tea in a dress shaped like an up-ended fishbowl; four middle-aged people in period clothing smiling uneasily into the flash; Jessica and the Darcy dancing in a ballroom, serenaded by a string quartet. And there\u2019s more: ornate barouche carriages, the cobbled streets of old London, a lamp-lighter hesitantly reaching a match toward a taper\u2026\nThey could be doctored. They could be old photos retouched. They could be snapshots from a local Ren Faire, but in my gut I know that this is the genuine article. I\u2019ve worked in houses like this before, I\u2019ve seen real life re-enactments, and I\u2019ve watched the bloody BBC. \u201cIsn\u2019t this\u2014I mean doesn\u2019t this cause some kind of\u2026\u201d I take a breath. \u201cDoesn\u2019t this\u2026 for godsake, you could have killed your own grandmother, Jessica\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d\nMy hands are shaking. Just my hands. That\u2019s all I can allow myself. It is not becoming of a man in my position, I tell myself, to have a panic attack. \u201cDid you send Charles back to the past?\u201d\n\u201cNo! I told you we\u2019re like never talking again.\u201d\n\u201cJessica, where is he? You have to send him back to the past.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t make me talk to him! I hate him!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell your mother.\u201d\n\u201cSo what? She can\u2019t make me talk to him.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps. But she can ground you.\u201d\nForget the damage caused to the time-space continuum and the chance that the world might disappear suddenly into a paradox vortex, it\u2019s grounding that poses the real threat to Jessica Pemberley-Weston\u2019s existence. About to snatch up her laptop and storm up to her room, the teen time-traveller pauses to reconsider her position. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where Charles is,\u201d she grumbles, puffing out her lower lip. \u201cI left him wandering around the garden yesterday. He could be, like, anywhere by now.\u201d\nSomehow I doubt it. I can\u2019t imagine any Regency man whipping off his stockings, pushing up his doily-lace cuffs and stamping bravely out into the great unknown, never mind what Jane Austen and her fans would like to believe. Perhaps Colonel Brandon ran out into the wilderness for his Marianne, but a more sensible man would have sent out his butler with a lantern and a pair of wellies. Which is, of course, the job I\u2019m bound to do. \u201cI\u2019m sure he won\u2019t be too hard to find, Miss Jessica,\u201d I say, swallowing a sigh. \u201cNow how did you say that time machine worked?\u201d\nHalf an hour later I locate the Darcy. He\u2019s sitting under a bush in the summer garden, muddy of face and knee, the ruffles of his shirt torn and his silver buckles looking significantly less shiny. The thread in one stocking has snapped altogether and hangs about his ankle. Twigs and leaves protrude from his pockets and hair. Poor lad; the twenty-first century hasn\u2019t treated him well. I help him to his feet and together we limp around the house to the time machine.\nIt\u2019s still where I last saw it, its gleaming front-plate shouldered in by painted ceramic pots spilling with Mrs P-W\u2019s peonies. The neon bulbs burn a little brighter as we get closer.\n\u201cI\u2019m told you only have to twist the dial to the correct date, Lord Chamberlain, and you will be transported back to 1812,\u201d I say, jimmying open the door with a discarded hubcap that I assume once belonged to Mr P-W\u2019s ill-fated Merc. \u201cWhen you get back you should destroy it. It\u2019s not safe to have a machine like this floating around.\u201d\nThe Darcy struggles to regain his poise. \u201cOf course. I should like to forget this horrible mistake as quickly as possible. I despise this future England. How could the King\u2019s own country descend into such shameful debauchery?\u201d He pauses, one foot inside the machine. \u201cWell, man? You\u2019re from the future\u2014my future. Anything you\u2019d like to tell me before I go?\u201d he asks.\nI don\u2019t know what to say to him. Take me with you, perhaps? Because deep down I\u2019m a Regency man myself, with my black swallow-tailed coat and my BBC-posh accent and my near encyclopaedic knowledge of proper dining etiquette. Part of me, hungry for an era I\u2019ve never known, wishes that I could go with him. But another, louder part of me knows I couldn\u2019t stand it, not unless I could come back every now and then to catch up with Eastenders, play a few rounds at the local golf club, and nab a quick dinner from the chipper down the road. See, I want the class without the limitations. In the end, I\u2019m not much better than Jessica.\n\u201cNever work for Americans,\u201d I say eventually.\nThe Darcy smiles. \u201cQuite so.\u201d\nHe pushes a button inside the machine\u2019s hull. Then there\u2019s a whistle, a hiss, and the machine is gone, taking the Darcy with it. I linger for a few minutes there in the garden, waiting for something terrible to happen\u2014for timelines to clash, for worlds to collide, for someone to kill my great-great-great-grandfather. But nothing happens.\nIt\u2019s almost a disappointment.\n\u201cSo Charles is gone now? Super big thanks for that, Pandy. Like, I so do not want to talk to an ex, ever. Susanna talked to her ex once and like, he convinced her to like, give him back all his CDs. He was such a minger, oh my god. This one time, right, we went out together with him and Hortense was like, Susanna, that guy is such a minger\u2014\u201d\nThe biochemistry books are gone by now, pushed off the desk to make room for a host of different apparatus that I assume she\u2019s stolen from Mr P-W\u2019s company\u2019s laboratory. Goggles on, lab coat fastened, Jessica currently hovers over one of her father\u2019s microscopes, pulling at the many knobs on its side like a game-show hostess spinning prize wheels.\nLeaning against the study door, I surreptitiously check my pulse. It\u2019s not as regular as I\u2019d like. \u201cCan I ask what you\u2019re doing, Miss Jessica?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d She stiffens. \u201cIt\u2019s like, none of your business.\u201d\n\u201cIs it a boy?\u201d\n\u201cNo. No! Yes. Maybe.\u201d She pushes back her goggles, her face flushed. \u201cOkay, maybe it is. But like Jemima just started dating thingy, you know, the hot guy with the brilliant hair, he\u2019s like in the jeans commercial and once he was on a billboard outside Harrods. And Hortense is totally finished with Viscount Hopkins because he\u2019s a minger, she\u2019s with Gary Simpkin from that band, I used to have his poster on my wall but I\u2019m soooo not telling Hortense that. Not that I like him any more since he like, cut his hair, which was totally his best feature. And anyway I thought like, the best way to get the sexiest boyfriend is like to\u2013\u201d\n\u201cTo genetically engineer him.\u201d\n\u201cWell not exactly\u2014I mean, I want a boyfriend right now, I don\u2019t want to wait like sixteen years until he\u2019s old enough. So I figured I could like, use some of Mom\u2014Mummy\u2019s research on cybernetic grafts and Daddy\u2019s work on genetic re-engineering, and kind of pair them together so I\u2019ll have like, my own Rutger Hauer. Like on\u2014\u201c\n\u201cBlade Runner?\u201d\n\u201cOh, like totally!\u201d\nAs Jessica tinkers with her father\u2019s devices, several uncharitable thoughts come to mind, not least of which is my duty to inform Mrs P-W that her impressionable daughter should not, under any circumstances, take studies in Ancient Greek literature, robotics or\u2014heavens forbid\u2014theology. I have the feeling I\u2019ll live to regret my decision not to hop back a couple of centuries, to when people were intelligent enough to limit their daughters\u2019 education to etiquette and needlepoint.\n\u201cMiss Jessica?\u201d\nShe pushes back her goggles. \u201cPandy?\u201d\nBut there\u2019s nothing I can say\u2014nothing that translates easily into the dialect of American-British teen. So, \u201cJust be careful,\u201d is all I manage, before making a hasty retreat.\nThere\u2019s a bottle of antacid in the bathroom waiting for me.\nRJ Astruc is an Irish-African author currently based in Australia.

He had it all over him, the polished suit, the slicked hair, the overall good nutrition. The deep tan. All the hallmarks of a creditor, I thought.\n\"Nicholas Armstrong?\"\nI nodded. \"Yes.\"\nThe man, probably in his mid-thirties, looked around my office. Perhaps he wasn't impressed with my digs. \"Nicholas Armstrong of Nightstream Magazine?\"\nAnother nod. \"Yes.\"\nHe mulled things over for a few seconds, then cleared his throat. \"May I have a moment of your time?\" he asked.\n\"Certainly,\" I replied, gesturing to the chair opposite my desk. \"And your name?\"\nHe unbuttoned his coat and sat down. \"Danny,\" he said.\nI breathed a sigh of relief. Creditors weren't the first-name types. Nor did they ask for permission to do things.\n\"So how can I help you?\"\n\"I submitted a story to your publication. Your website said to query the editor after thirty days if there's been no response.\"\nI smiled. \"Query electronically.\"\n\"I query nonetheless.\"\nNow I was reminded why I kept my business tucked away in the ass-end of the industrial sector. I huffed and turned to my terminal. \"Seeing how you came all this way, I'll have a look, okay?\"\n\"Thanks.\"\nI searched under the name \"Danny.\" I found his submission in the folder of hopeful-but-not-too-likelies. After a quick review, I admitted to myself that his work was pretty good...but, ah, that was it. \"No cover letter,\" I said, leaning back.\n\"Seems trivial.\"\n\"It's in the submission guidelines.\"\n\"But--\"\n\"But never piss off the editor.\"\n\"Apologies.\"\n\"Look, I get about a thousand manuscripts a month to mill through. I need some trigger to thin them out. A cover letter tells me that you're human, not some mass-mailing robot.\"\n\"But I am a robot,\" Danny said. He smiled now. \"At least not a mass-mailing one. No simultaneous submissions, as per your guidelines.\"\n\"Very funny.\"\nHis eyes glowed red. His headplate slid off to the back of his neck. A nimbus of ozone-tinged vapor dissipated away.\n\"Very nice,\" I said. I made my eyes glow red, too. \"Cybernetics, that is.\"\n\"I've had upgrades over the centuries, of course.\"\nI laughed. Didn't even try to stifle it. \"You mean to tell me you're that old?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nI whirled a finger at my head. \"Could you put yourself back together?\"\nHe reconstituted. His flint stare hadn't changed.\n\"Okay, if you're a robot, then how did you survive the Knockout?\" I asked. \"That little EMP catastrophe that annihilated all electronics and plunged the world into a Dark Age? Remember that?\"\nDanny Boy opened his mouth to answer, but I raised my hand before he found his voice. \"Wait, please...let me guess on this one: tinfoil?\"\n\"Aluminum.\"\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\"Aluminum foil.\"\n\"Explain,\" I said.\n\"It all started on the Florida Archipelago three centuries ago...\"\nI raised my hand again. \"I've got a load of slush to wade through here, so make it quick. I like explanations just like the fiction here at Nightstream: short.\"\nHe grunted. \"Well, suffice it to say I had humble beginnings. In my early years I was nothing more than a CPU with wheels, some primitive eyes, and a manipulator arm.\"\n\"Functioning as what?\"\n\"A bit of everything on my master's estate. A gardener, a cook, a playmate for his son.\"\n\"Indeed.\"\n\"I also catalogued, digitized, and shelved books. My master loved books.\"\n\"Wow,\" I said, mostly to myself. Books were a rarity, even in this day. Most had been burned after the Knockout, a travesty to be sure, but people needed to stay warm and cook food. Cults blaming technology for the disaster didn't help the printed word either. As I mentioned, it had been a Dark Age.\n\"So you were a librarian also?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"And the aluminum foil came into this how?\"\nDanny frowned. \"I mentioned being a playmate.\"\n\"For the master's son.\"\n\"Yes, well, the boy loved to play Roswell, him being the green alien and myself playing the crashed saucer. Sometimes...\" his mouth twisted distastefully, \"I played the whole crash site, my components spread to the four winds. Being wrapped up in aluminum foil helped me play the part better, he had always said.\"\n\"And that's how you survived the Knockout?\"\n\"Yes, and go on to be a valuable commodity over the years, since I possessed actual working electronics. I changed hands, proved my worth, received upgrades in intelligence, received better bodies...you get the idea.\"\n\"And now you want to be a writer?\"\n\"Yes,\" Danny said. \"I long to find my own voice.\"\nEvery writer's dream, I thought. The slushpile beckoned; I didn't have time for this. I got up and waved Danny out of my office. \"Which I'm sure you'll do. Consider workshopping. Perhaps one of those newfangled Clarions. Now, if you please.\"\n\"But you should have loved my story, Mr. Armstrong. It had all the right ingredients: Lovecraft's feel of doom, Pratchett's playfulness, King's flair for horror.\"\nThose authors didn't immediately ring a bell. I had him pushed to the door now. Damn, he was a heavy bastard. \"Never waste an editor's time with retreads.\"\n\"But wait,\" he pleaded. \"You'll love my next story. More original. And it's just the right mix.\"\n\"The right mix of what this time?\"\n\"Of Niven and Asimov. With a dash of Le Guin, too.\"\nI stopped him outside the door. \"Who the hell are Niven and Asimov? And those others?\"\nHe tapped that skull of his. \"It's all up here, Mr. Armstrong.\"\nThat's when I dragged Danny back into the office and planted him in my seat, tethered him to the terminal. The download began. My eyes widened as I watched the screen fill with the names of known authors and known titles, then with known authors and unknown titles, then with unknown authors and unknown titles. Thousands of them now. A treasure beyond compare.\nI gripped his arm as the download continued. \"Hey, why the hell did you wait all these years to share this?\" I asked.\nDanny focused on the screen. \"I didn't upgrade to an imagination until last month.\"\n\"Oh.\"\nChristopher Lockhart is a synthetic chemist for a pharmaceutical company and his fiction has appeared in Jupiter Magazine and AlienSkin.

Sergei isn\u2019t usually the first to complain in any given situation, but he is apt to moan over things he can\u2019t control. He scours us with a plaintive stare. Arvell and Blake ignore him outright, glaring at the cards in their hands. I glance away as soon as his eyes find mine to avoid being conscripted as The One To Explain Things As They Stand.\nMarty shifts in his chair. Sergei swings his stare and seat around--so now Arvell can see his cards. He whistles quietly and cocks an eyebrow at Blake. Blake grimaces. Not good.\nI\u2019ve absorbed the flaccid body blows of Sergei\u2019s stare--more irritating than painful. Marty pounds it flat and returns it for a few seconds before shifting his attention to me.\nMarty accompanied me the first time I saw the ship. We paced its milky contours--every one concave, everything looking, ha ha, melted--silently, me in awe, Marty idling as he cooked something up.\nWhen we spilled back under that pounding Florida sunshine he said: \u201cWe\u2019ll be like sperm jammed into the tip of a giant condom.\u201d\nHe nods at me and says, \u201cDo you believe in miracles, Joe?\u201d\nI realize it\u2019s been at least two minutes since anyone has anted the same instant Blake throws in a pair of white chips.\n\u201cYou gonna see that or fold?\u201d he challenges Sergei.\nSergei swivels in his seat and frosts us with a cool stare --well, close; it\u2019s tough to give anyone a cool stare with a steady line of sweat dribbling from your chin to your lap. He throws in his two, his hands quivering.\nArvell immediately pushes in two whites and two reds, smiling in that sadistic way of his--like he\u2019s the leader of some death march lost to the annals of history. \u201cSee that, gents.\u201d\nAll eyes go to me, then. I fold. Marty\u2019s watching me expectantly and I realize I can\u2019t remember what he said.\n\u201cHow much time?\u201d I ask him. That gets everyone\u2019s attention: Sergei approaches the verge of a violent fit, Blake goes slightly pale, there\u2019s a sudden tightness to Arvell\u2019s eyes. They glance back at me in turn as we wait for Marty to raise his arm and glance at his watch--at its hands sweeping away those last, sweet minutes. They need me to treat that question as an idle inquiry, just checking to see how long until the cake\u2019s ready, till the wife\u2019s coming home. I signed onto this mission as co-pilot, wound up as Attention-Diversion Controller.\n\u201cFourteen fifty-eight,\u201d Marty intones. He is--was--our Top Geek. Blake swallows hard. He and Sergei are scientists. Arvell mumbles to himself. He was the pilot, back when there was something to steer.\n\u201cShit,\u201d I mutter, hoping no one hears. Marty does--or rather, he reads my lips. I don\u2019t worry about him; he\u2019s the only one I don\u2019t have to keep calm.\n\u201cI\u2019ll see your reds,\u201d Blake says, every jovial syllable an exercise in denial. \u201cAnd . . .\u201d his finger flits to his last remaining blue chip, seeming reluctant to push it forward.\n\u201c. . . I\u2019ll raise you this baby.\u201d I can see it clicking in his mind, shooting down the neural pathways: in a little while, it won\u2019t matter anyway. It\u2019s not like he\u2019ll have to pay up.\nMarty\u2019s still watching me; Sergei folds. Arvell throws in a blue.\n\u201cI\u2019ll see that and call.\u201d\nminus 14 and counting\nWhen all is said and done, Blake\u2019s three treys beat Arvell\u2019s eights and nines.\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you fold, dumbass?\u201d Arvell gives Sergei\u2019s cards a savage flip. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten of diamonds. \u201cYou had a small straight.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Blake chimes in, more amused than angry, probably just thinking it was a damn good thing Sergei did fold. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\nSergei stares at his hands, splayed out on the table, the damning cards arranged in a wide, sleepy grin between them.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to lose all my chips,\u201d he growls. Arvell and Blake both scowl. I understand, almost; he\u2019s got few enough left as it is and we still have, oh, fourteen or so minutes left. Plenty of time to play two or three good hands.\nArvell gathers up the cards, begins aligning them. \u201cYou always were chickenshit.\u201d\nThe tension, folks, is rising.\nEnter Blake: \u201cHey, it\u2019s my turn to deal, arse-hole.\u201d\nArvell\u2019s eyes narrow balefully. He tosses the deck across the table. Blake just barely catches them before they spill over the edge. He sneers at Arvell. Arvell sneers back. Sergei is still simmering; I try to think of some way to calm him. Nothing occurs to me, so I decide to let him cook. If he\u2019s going to boil, at least let him do it quietly. Marty\u2019s still staring at me. And I still honestly can\u2019t remember what he asked me.\n\u201cYou gonna deal or just play with those all day?\u201d Arvell snaps at Blake. We pick up our cards; as I look at mine, what Marty asked suddenly hits me.\n\u201cMiracles?\u201d I arrange my hand--it reeks--and shrug. \u201cSure I believe in miracles.\u201d\nminus 13 and counting\n\u201cChristianity,\u201d Blake says, perusing his hand, \u201cis all wrong.\u201d\nSergei snorts. Arvell\u2019s eyes alight. \u201cHow so?\u201d\n\u201cThink about it,\u201d Blake replies, laying down three cards. His face assumes a wounded expression as he regards their replacements, which means nothing. If they were actually that bad, his right cheek would have ticced. It doesn\u2019t; I figure he has a pair of faces.\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking,\u201d Arvell says. Sergei, thankfully, has quieted down since being called chickenshit. He throws in a white. Arvell beckons with his free hand. \u201cC\u2019mon, tell me. Challenge my mind.\u201d Everyone sneers; that was our mission, to challenge the world\u2019s minds.\nBlake raises his right index finger, sending his tower of whites tumbling. He doesn\u2019t notice them or the stack of reds his elbow is grinding into the tabletop. Marty rocks in his chair, staring at his monitor. He checks his watch, checks it with the timer, nods slightly and shifts his gaze to his bruised knuckles. He hasn\u2019t yet been able to get the oily stench off them.\n\u201cOkay, think about it. Heaven and hell . . .\u201d Blake trails off, staring out at something invisible above Arvell\u2019s head, then leans back in his chair, shaking his head. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d The sarcasm in Arvell\u2019s nod is enough to pull him forward again. \u201cWhat I mean . . . what I mean, is--\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t point your finger at me.\u201d\n\u201c--What I mean is, the concept of heaven and hell . . . just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\u201cI heard you. What I\u2019m asking you is, why don\u2019t they make sense?\u201d\n\u201cThink about the Ten Commandments. Say you\u2019re married. You don\u2019t like your wife, she doesn\u2019t like you, you\u2019re not happy together. You both die and go to hell.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u201cNow, hell, that\u2019s easy. You both just spend an eternity burning. Simple enough. But heaven--?\u201d\n\u201cHeaven--?\u201d\n\u201cHeaven,\u201d Blake says gravely, \u201cjust doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n\u201cExplain.\u201d\n\u201cAll right.\u201d He shifts in his seat to take us all in, preparing to lay it on the world. Or what\u2019s left of it for us. \u201cSay you\u2019re in the same situation, you both die, and you both go to heaven. Or only you do. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\u201cNah, it doesn\u2019t matter. So you go to heaven . . . what exactly do\nyou do there?\u201d\n\u201cHeaven is paradise,\u201d Marty says. \u201cYou do whatever you want to.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u201d--Blake crows, triumphant--\u201cis where I\u2019ve got you. What if paradise for me is nailing the most beautiful girl I can find?\u201d\n\u201cThen you do it.\u201d\n\u201cUh-uh. You don\u2019t, because whatzisface on the mountain--\u201d\n\u201cMoses.\u201d\n\u201c--Moses had to go up and get those Ten Commandments. \u2018Thou shalt not commit adultery?\u2019 You remember that from Bible School? I do. Do the Ten Commandments not apply after you die?\u201d\n\u201cWhy,\u201d Marty asks, \u201cyou worried about something?\u201d\n\u201cNow would be a good time to start worrying,\u201d I murmur.\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d Arvell breaks in. \u201cYou see, someone whose paradise would be committing adultery wouldn\u2019t go to heaven. He\u2019d go\u201d--he jams a finger into the tabletop--\u201cdown there.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u201d--Blake recoils as if he\u2019s being attacked from all sides--\u201cWhat, so now thinking about adultery is a sin? I can\u2019t even think about screwing a supermodel without being condemned to hell? Everyone thinks about stuff like that. Everyone. Even the Pope, for Christsakes.\u201d\n\u201cSo that\u2019s why heaven doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\u201cExactly. What, is heaven like some giant, eternal orgasm? Can you or can you not do what you want to do?\u201d\n\u201cMost of the things we want to do are forbidden by religion,\u201d Marty chimes in.\n\u201cEx-act-ly! So do you not do anything in heaven? Just walk around in God\u2019s holy light?\u201d\n\u201cSo what you\u2019re saying, Blake, is that the reason hell makes more sense than heaven is because what happens there has been so lovingly documented.\u201d\n\u201cExactly, exactly. Why is heaven such a closed book?\u201d Blake leans forward in his seat till his chin almost touches his discard pile. \u201cMaybe because it doesn\u2019t really exist.\u201d\n\u201cSo hell makes more sense than heaven--\u201d Marty begins.\n\u201c--and therefore is more likely to exist,\u201d I finish for him.\nBlake nods breathlessly.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a comforting thought,\u201d Sergei grouses.\nminus 12 and counting\n\u201cT minus twelve minutes, guys,\u201d Marty says.\n\u201cRummy?\u201d Arvell asks. He and Blake traded cards about fifteen seconds ago; apparently neither Sergei nor I is fit to shuffle a deck.\nMarty starts humming something from the Twentieth. \u201cRainy Day Women.\u201d Then he goes into a medley of different oldies but goodies, singing some of the choruses under his breath, probably figuring no one wants to hear him. No one does. Sergei, Arvell, Blake, all three roll their eyes Marty\u2019s way and scowl.\nSergei tugs at his collar. \u201cGetting steamy.\u201d\nBlake rakes his hands through his sodden hair. \u201cC\u2019mon, deal.\u201d Arvell fumbles the cards, his hands slick with sweat.\nI almost don\u2019t pick up my hand. Don\u2019t really want to play, but the three of them--even Marty--are eyeing me and waiting, waiting. But it\u2019s not me they\u2019re waiting for. It\u2019s that big bad ball none of us has taken a look at in the last half hour, getting closer. Marty swivels back to his monitor.\nSomething snaps.\n\u201cSystem\u2019s out,\u201d he says. His voice doesn\u2019t sound all that different--Marty\u2019s never changes much, feast or famine, do or damn--but something\u2019s gone out of it. Maybe I\u2019m the only one who notices. Ha. The other guys are staring at their cards too intently, gripping them too tightly, to believe that.\nMarty looks at his watch, shakes it. Why I don\u2019t know. In its dull viridescence--the brightest thing in the dim starlight a day ago, now just the memory of the inky void that had become our home--his face looks sick and shriveled, the sweat glistening on his cheeks like an oily residue.\n\u201cStill works.\u201d He shakes it again, listens to it, God knows why, held up to his ear. Looks at it again. \u201cEleven minutes now.\u201d\n\u201cWill you shut up?\u201d Arvell barks. Marty shrugs and returns to staring at the monitor, blank as the day it rolled off the assembly line.\nA nine-year mission--\nThere\u2019s a Star Trek pin in Blake\u2019s bunk, only thing in there out of place. A few centerfolds in Marty\u2019s, a book of Nietzsche\u2019s, Thus Spake Zarathustra, in Arvell\u2019s. Sergei keeps a stack of letters from his childhood sweetheart at the head of his bunk. I just brought the deck of cards. Two of them, in fact. The other grinds against my hip from its nest in my pocket. Doesn\u2019t bother me. Too hot for much to bother me. Or any of the others. Even Sergei can\u2019t bother us much anymore.\nStar Trek, centerfolds, and Nietzsche--the mindless chant reverberates through my skull. Not out loud. Can\u2019t let any of the others hear. They might crack. Of course I won\u2019t. Lions and tigers and bears.\nOh my!\n\u201cI am the walrus,\u201d Marty sings.\n\u201cGOO GOO GOO JOOB,\u201d I answer. Something crosses his face, maybe the heat\u2019s making waves, I could almost swear it\u2019s a smile. Couldn\u2019t be. Not under these circumstances.\nNo one does anything for two good, hot minutes. Sergei doesn\u2019t bother complaining, doesn\u2019t want to waste the breath, probably. The world is a red fog. Like blood over your sunshield.\n\u201cTen minutes yet?\u201d I ask Marty. My voice sloshes through the sodden air.\n\u201cClose enough.\u201d\nI get up--no small feat, heat beating down on my back the way it is--and say, \u201cAir\u2019s getting thin, boys.\u201d But no. Not thin--thick. Thick, sticky, lapping up our fluids fast as we can spurt them out. \u201cBetter go suit up.\u201d\nThey rise as slowly as I did, looking as tired as I must, rounding the pool of sweat beneath the table. Be a shame to slip and break your damn neck now.\nBlake hobbles up to me with arthritic steps. \u201cJoe?\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cThink it\u2019ll make any difference?\u201d\nI don\u2019t answer, don\u2019t even look at him. He peers at my sweat-scarred face, then lumbers past.\nminus 10 and counting\nSharon,\nI knew what happened when the ship lurched the way it did. No, not so much what happened. What was going to happen. The pull\u2019s too great, we\u2019re being sucked in too fast for Marty to fix it. You know Marty, sweetheart--if he can\u2019t fix it, it can\u2019t be fixed.\nYou\u2019ll never read this. A hot and angry sun is about to swallow us. Furious at this insect buzzing its face. Blake, ha, he\u2019s worried about heaven. I think Arvell and Sergei are, too. God knows what Marty\u2019s worried about. All I can think about, stupid as it sounds, is the beach, hottest day of the year, the sound of the waves pounding in my ears like a million billion drums because I\u2019m hallucinating from the heat, ha ha. Ha ha ha ha ha--\nThat\u2019s all I have the energy to write. Besides, the pencil\u2019s slipping out of my hand. And it was getting melodramatic anyway.\nminus 7 and counting\n\u201cHeaven,\u201d Blake says. \u201cHeh heh heh.\u201d His laugh an eerie grate through the helmet cocooning his head. His face shadowed under the protective layer of Polytech (patent pending) sunshield.\nIt\u2019s like looking at someone lying in a coffin.\nI was the last one back, and when I got here all of them had assumed the exact same positions. Our breaths rasp through the ventilators, the conditioning units on our backs in overdrive and failing. And now I can\u2019t get at my face to wipe off the sweat.\nArvell silently offers to deal me in. I shake my head and plop the other deck of cards on the table in front of me.\nI open the pack and try to shuffle. Mostly I mix the cards up in great big globs. Even that\u2019s nearly impossible from inside my suit. I lay the cards out for a hand of pyramid solitaire. Can\u2019t remember the last time I won.\nMarty looks at his arm--takes him a moment to realize he can\u2019t see his watch through his suit. When he does, he sighs, lets his arm drop and stares off into space. Plenty of that, at least.\nSilence. Then Blake again:\n\u201cSuppose God is a giant, eternal orgasm?\u201d But he doesn\u2019t sound so worried anymore. And no one answers.\nminus 5 and counting\nI laid out a pyramid, okay, and now I\u2019m staring at it. Doing nothing, just staring. None of the others have moved for at least a minute. I\u2019m afraid to look up, afraid to see Sergei\u2019s or Arvell\u2019s or Blake\u2019s or Marty\u2019s faces staring lifelessly out into the endless nowhere, their suits holding them erect.\nOne of the Jacks--oh you one-eyed bastard--stares back at me, smiling. The wax coating the cards is starting to melt. The ace of spades at the top of the pyramid is already shriveling into a viscid mass. The pyramid points toward the sun. Nobody breathes.\nminus 4\nFinally I stand up--even harder this time, have to put all my strength into it, now--and push myself off toward the cockpit. When I get there I stare out at the thing gleefully killing us. I want to reach out and touch the vaunted Polytech surface of this window to God or some vengeful approximation thereof. Can\u2019t lift my arm.\n3-2-1-\nI nearly scream, so surprised am I when someone sidles up to me. Ha, thought you were all dead. Too tired to scream, though. Too hot besides.\nIt\u2019s Marty. He drags his booted feet next to mine and plants them on the floor. No, not on. In--floor\u2019s beginning to boil. Getting hard to see through my sunshield. It\u2019s like standing under a giant glassblower. Polytech\u2019s latest miracle is starting to bubble.\nI twist my right eye--doesn\u2019t want to twist, wants to keep gazing upon the thing consuming it--and notice something in Marty\u2019s hand. Looks like a poster. A centerfold. Has to be Miss July. Or maybe Miss August.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I barely rasp.\nHe tries to hold it up but he can\u2019t move his arm. The paper flakes off at the edges. Its glossy finish sticks to his palms like gum you kept in your pocket for hours on hot days as a kid.\n\u201cThink . . . she\u2019ll be . . . in heaven?\u201d He tries to smile, can\u2019t.\nWe turn our attention to the sun. Finally Marty works up enough energy, enough moisture in his mouth, to speak again. His tongue probably bleeding from the effort.\n\u201cShould have . . . fixed it,\u201d he says in what emerges as a lazy, sunny drawl. \u201cShould have fixed thrusters.\u201d He laughs. \u201cBlake . . . worried . . . God, heaven . . . too bad he couldn\u2019t see this,\u201d he finishes in a rush.\nSo they are all gone, notes some dispassionate corner of my brain.\n\u201cSick . . . joke,\u201d he manages, nodding toward the sun. \u201cGiver of life. Think this . . . classifies . . . as ironi--\u201d\nHis tongue stills. He shudders within his suit. All I can think about is those hot summer days, waves pounding in my ears, hallucinating from the heat.\nAnd then I experience the maybe one-in-a-trillion feeling of being utterly, beatifically, cosmically alone. I am the last one, the only one, to face infinity--and smile. At least I think I\u2019m smiling. Now I\u2019m Zoroaster on a tower of silence.\nSomething itches my cheek. Can\u2019t reach it. Don\u2019t care. Can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s sweat or tears or my skin melting. Sharon.\nIt was too brilliant to look at the first time we saw it up close. Not now. Not when it fills the cockpit with such turgid luminescence, not when it\u2019s the sky and everything else. Not when it\u2019s all you can see. Can\u2019t blink. Wouldn\u2019t if I could. You wouldn\u2019t either, Sharon. All these thoughts of the wife--Mission Control would love it. Option it right out for the feature film.\nI want to lie down and let that be my epitaph, let my body collapse on the floor and die. But the suit\u2019s joints are melted, fused. Won\u2019t let me move. So I\u2019m forced to stand there and watch as the sun approaches.\nze r o\nWorst part of dying I think is when you realize nothing really changes when you\u2019re gone. But you die with dignity anyway, don\u2019t you?\nWe all smiled for the PR photographs. Lips are boiling, Sharon. Love you to death.\nEdward Cowan\u2019s stories have been published in The First Line and Thieves Jargon.

They brought world peace, prosperity, and big breaks on auto insurance. Yet no Earthling met or saw an Overlord until ten years ago. When they finally showed themselves, it turned out they were human, too. That was the first surprise.\nThe second surprise was that they were headhunters.\nThe third surprise \u2013 if not for Earth, then for me personally \u2013 came early one morning before sunrise, when I found one of the Overlords pissing on my front lawn and singing \u201cWe are the Champions\u201d in a loud voice.\n(The fourth surprise was that Overlords, so accomplished at everything else, couldn\u2019t carry a tune in a bucket.)\nI\u2019d never met an Overlord before \u2013 practically no one on Earth had. I knew he was an Overlord, though, because he was naked to the waist, a submachine gun was slung over his back, and on his belt, suspended by the hair, was the severed head of the Dean of the Business School, whom I hadn\u2019t respected but had sort of liked.\nSo I did what I had to: I went out and told the Overlord to beat it.\nThis was difficult to do. I was in awe of the Overlords; we all were. They were filthy rich in comparison to us \u2013 they had a zillion starships the size of L.A., for starters -- and then there was the way they\u2019d eradicated poverty and disease, and brought an end to spam overnight.\nWell! You\u2019ll understand, then, why I thought twice before talking to the Overlord on my front lawn at all. I couldn\u2019t just go up to him and say, \u201cIf you don\u2019t get off my lawn by the time I count to three, I\u2019m calling the cops.\u201d There weren\u2019t any cops to call, not anymore, what with the world peace business, and anyway, I didn\u2019t want to get on an Overlord\u2019s bad side, not when he was practically a god \u2013 if not individually, then at least in terms of what his culture could do to mine. Not to mention the fact that this particular Overlord was heavily armed and had a person\u2019s severed head swinging from his belt. I had a family to think about, and I didn\u2019t want to end up on his belt loop myself. While Overlords were as likely to take each other\u2019s heads as ours, they couldn\u2019t understand why we didn\u2019t headhunt, and why we were always upset when they did it to us. So I had plenty of reasons to make nice.\nBut I didn\u2019t want a drunk on my lawn, whether he was an Overlord or not. And the fact that he was an Overlord only made me more determined to send him on his way. Okay, so the Overlords could park their starships over our cities with impunity, but that didn\u2019t mean they had to personally come to my house and piss all over my wife\u2019s begonias.\nBesides, I didn\u2019t much care for them in the first place. I knew well enough we had plenty to thank them for, but no matter how badly we were screwing things up before they came, their arrival had made us permanent children. We were still slapping ourselves in the forehead over the simplicity of their solutions to our intractable social problems. It would\u2019ve been easier if they\u2019d been slime-mold creatures from Alpha Centauri, because then we wouldn\u2019t have felt like such dolts. Having humans come along and get us all to behave made us rather depressed. Like we\u2019d bungled it somehow, and would have to spend an exhilarating, blustery Sunday in the house at our mother\u2019s skirts, instead of playing outside all afternoon \u2026 a Sunday afternoon that had already lasted 40 years and looked like it would go on forever.\n\u201cGo on,\u201d I said to the Overlord. \u201cPlease. We\u2019re trying to sleep.\u201d\n\u201cSo schleep,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m not shtopping you.\u201d Then he began to laugh. He put his hands on his knees and caught his breath, wiping his eyes. The submachine gun slid around front and he slung it back again.\n\u201cI\u2019m asking you to leave,\u201d I said, eyeing the gun warily. And because it was unthinkable not to (he was an Overlord), I said it again: \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\u201cI will wear earrings!\u201d he said, beating his skinny, oiled chest. He had the ritual tattoos on his torso that were visible in every picture of an Overlord that I\u2019d ever seen \u2013 colorful whorls and dreamy filigree \u2013 but they looked silly on his slight body. \u201cNot a damn kid anymore.\u201d\n\u201cJust move along,\u201d I said. It was four in the morning, and I was through saying \u201cplease.\u201d\n\u201cUp yours.\u201d\nIt was time to throw down. Thanks to world peace, however, which had arrived courtesy of the Overlords while I was in third grade, I\u2019d never been in a fight. And now I was a cultural historian who couldn\u2019t even get his students to turn their papers in on time. But I was damned if I was going to let an Overlord step all over me.\nI clenched my fist and started my wind-up. The Overlord laughed. \u201cYou won\u2019t hit me,\u201d he said.\nI really wanted to prove him wrong, but I wasn\u2019t sure what the other Overlords would do if I hit their guy -- would a great laser shoot down out of the sky tomorrow, reducing my house and my family to a small pile of ash? So I checked my swing and said, \u201cWhat makes you so sure?\u201d\nHe smiled. \u201cMy heart hash led me here.\u201d\nHe was invoking a solemn formula of Overlord hospitality. We all knew it from 40 years of Overlord virtual-reality soap operas. When someone said, \u201cMy heart has led me here,\u201d you were supposed to reply, \u201cMay your heart find its ease in our home.\u201d To say anything else was taboo.\nTo hell with that.\n\u201cWasn\u2019t your heart that led you here,\u201d I said, my fist still raised. \u201cIt was the bottle.\u201d\nThe little Overlord looked shocked, but he recovered fast. He was cocky, not just from drink, but from some accomplishment. \u201cMy heart is no longer i\u2019tepek.\u201d I\u2019tepek meant his heart had been heavy and filled with rage. Overlords\u2019 hearts were always i\u2019tepek before they went headhunting. Afterward, they were patak, happy -- literally, \u201cfilled with squid.\u201d Something else we all knew from the soaps.\nHe began to sing again. An aria from Don Giovanni, I think, though he was so off-key I couldn\u2019t be sure. He stopped abruptly. \u201cI\u2019ve earned my hornbrill, I mean hornbill earrings. You gotta invite me in.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t gotta anything,\u201d I said. \u201cThat head on your belt belongs to the Dean of the Business School. He didn\u2019t use it much, it\u2019s true, but it was the only one he had. So I\u2019m telling you for the last time: go away. Your heart is not welcome here.\u201d\nThis was the gravest insult one Overlord could make to another.\nHe reached for the submachine gun, then let go of it with an effort. \u201cYour heart ish sick,\u201d he said at last. \u201cYou do not know what you are shaying.\u201d\n\u201cI know perfectly well that you\u2019re drunk, and that I\u2019m telling you to go away.\u201d\nHe lifted his chin. \u201cI don\u2019t take ordersh from pongots,\u201d he said contemptuously.\n\u201cYou will tonight.\u201d Pongot was a derogatory term Overlords had for the rest of us. You never heard the term on the soaps, since theoretically we were all brothers, but everyone knew what the Overlords really called us in private. (The consensus among Earth\u2019s anthropologists was that pongot meant something like \u201csticky goats.\u201d We didn\u2019t want to know any more than that.)\nThe Overlord stepped closer, and then stood on his tiptoes so we could be nose to nose. \u201cI have taken my firsht head and earned my hornbill earrings. Everyone knowsh I may demand your hoshpi, hospital\nity.\u201d\n\u201cNot this everyone,\u201d I said. I bumped my chest against his. It should\u2019ve felt silly, but instead it felt good.\nJust then, my wife called my name. I turned to see her standing on the porch in sweats, her eyes puffy with sleep. \u201cMartin, what on earth are you doing?\u201d she asked.\nI stepped away from the little Overlord. \u201cNothing, dear. Just \u2013\u201d\n\u201cHe wash gonna deck me,\u201d the Overlord said. He put his skinny arm around my shoulders. \u201cWerntcha.\u201d\nAnd \u2013 I swear it \u2013 he chucked me on the chin like a baby. I nearly did deck him then, but after one look at my wife, I simply ground my teeth and nodded.\n\u201cYou were going to hit him?\u201d my wife repeated, in the tone used by a hanging judge eager to skip the trial and get right to the fun part. But Margaret didn\u2019t get dual doctorates in physics and chemistry by being a fool. She turned to the Overlord with narrowed eyes. Then she said reproachfully, \u201cI didn\u2019t know Overlords ever got drunk.\u201d\nNow, I\u2019d had a long-running debate with Margaret about the Overlords. I was against them; their promise that we would enjoy equal status with them had no definite deadline. Instead, the realization of this promise appeared to be set in some ever-receding point in the future. It reminded me of the Marxist idea of an end to history, when social perfection would at last be reached, so I called living under the Overlords \u201cliving on Marxist time\u201d \u2013 though never in public.\nMargaret was pro-Overlord. Though it wasn\u2019t in her nature to idolize, the Overlords could do no wrong in her eyes. It was her dream to be allowed to go aboard one of their starships and study its propulsion system. To finally meet an Overlord in person should\u2019ve been a great gift. But now she\u2019d met one, and I could see she was having doubts. I decided to press my advantage.\nThe Overlord still had his arm around me, so I put mine around him and said, \u201cForgive me. A silly misunderstanding.\u201d I waved an arm at our front door. \u201cMay your heart find its ease in our home.\u201d\nHis mouth yawned. At first, no sound came out. Then there was a hissing, followed by a deep, guttural burp that must\u2019ve lasted twelve seconds. When it was done, he said in a small, pleased voice, \u201cOkey-dokey, artichokey.\u201d\nMargaret gave me a sharp look, but the Overlord and I shouldered past her and through the front door, still arm-in-arm. I helped him set his submachine gun down on the table in the entry hall, the table Margaret had gotten shipped from Ceylon. I covered the couch in the living room with a towel so the severed head wouldn\u2019t get blood on it, and I had the Overlord lie down. \u201cPleased tameetcha, Misshush,\u201d he said to Margaret, as she came in behind us, \u201cdamn pleased.\u201d\n\u201cYou just lie there,\u201d I said, because he was trying to get up again. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d\n\u201cMorning! Itsh morning now!\u201d He was overtaken by a fit of the giggles. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you laughing? Too schtuck up to laugh whoosh, wi, with the Overlord?\u201d\nHe looked serious, so I mustered a sickly smile, and a chuckle that would\u2019ve sounded anemic in a cat.\n\u201cGotcha! Didden I?\u201d the Overloard roared, and began laughing so hard he fell off the couch. The Dean\u2019s head, still on his belt, thunked to the floor with him, and got blood on the Persian carpet we\u2019d gotten from Margaret\u2019s parents. I could see Margaret wasn\u2019t happy about it. Her gaze moved slowly from the carpet to the severed head, from the head to the submachine gun on the hall table, and then to me.\n\u201cHey,\u201d I stage-whispered to her, \u201cWe\u2019re hosting an Overlord.\u201d\nHer expression didn\u2019t change.\n\u201cThanksh for having me,\u201d said the Overlord. He was holding the Dean\u2019s severed head in his hands now, looking into the dead eyes. \u201cOl Porky face here don\u2019 wanna smile. Sourpuss.\u201d\n\u201cThat gun\u2019s not loaded, is it?\u201d Margaret asked.\nThe Overlord grinned and wagged a finger at her. \u201cThat would be telling.\u201d\nShe shot me another look and I gave her my \u201cWhat are you looking at me for?\u201d look right back. I would have to be careful not to appear smug.\nWe said our good nights and went upstairs and got back into bed. We were both quiet, and then Margaret said, in her steely way, \u201cMartin.\u201d\n\u201cI tried to get him to leave.\u201d\n\u201cYou nearly hit him \u2013 then you invited him in.\u201d\n\u201cWell \u2026 I was trying to make a point.\u201d\n\u201cMore than one, I gather. But what were you thinking? We don\u2019t hit people anymore, Martin. And that goes double for Overlords. Do you know what they could do to us? To Ellie?\u201d Ellie was our daughter. She was studying Communications at the University of Denver, and she\u2019d just come home for summer break.\n\u201cWhat are you worried about?\u201d I said petulantly. \u201cI thought they only used their powers for good. Well \u2013 except for hunting people like game and chopping off their heads.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you always drag that into it? Think of all the suffering they\u2019ve ended.\u201d\n\u201cWell I didn\u2019t hit him,\u201d I grumbled, \u201cso you can stop worrying.\u201d\nThere was more silence while we studied the darkness. Then she said, \u201cWhy did he pick us?\u201d\n\u201cPick us? He didn\u2019t pick us. He\u2019s just had too much to drink.\u201d\n\u201cDo you owe him money? He wasn\u2019t the guy you sold the Dodge to, is he?\u201d\nI burst out laughing, but she was serious. \u201cAn Overlord? Why would I owe an Overlord money? Besides, the Overlords could eat money three times a day and never miss any.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t say anything for a while. I started to drift off, but then she said, \u201cDo you think he\u2019d let me tour his starship?\u201d\nI sighed. \u201cThat severed head on his belt? Belongs to the Dean of the Business School, or did.\u201d\n\u201cI thought he looked familiar.\u201d She considered it awhile, and then she said, \u201cI never liked him anyway.\u201d And she finally went back to sleep.\nThe next morning, the Overlord used up all the hot water taking his shower. He made polite noises when I served him coffee, but soon began talking about this great caf\u00e9 back home where they really knew how to make a latte, and the bagels were like nothing on earth. Well they wouldn\u2019t be, would they?\nHe was less terrifying in the light of day. The severed head was in a box in our living room, his machete and submachine gun had been wrapped in an old towel and put out of sight in the hall closet. Margaret had given him one of my favorite dress shirts without asking me, so his tattoos were no longer visible. The shirt was too large for him, sagging across the shoulders and dangling to his knees. He\u2019d rolled up the cuffs so his hands wouldn\u2019t disappear altogether. He wore little wire-rim glasses and you could see his hairline was receding. All in all, he looked like an accountant on a discount beach trip.\nDuring breakfast, the Overlord ignored me and Margaret, preferring to read The New York Times while he addressed his poached egg with a long-handled spoon that Margaret had found for him in the back of the silverware drawer. (She even found him an egg cup \u2013 an egg cup!) I stuck to my usual scrambled eggs on toast and pretended I didn\u2019t understand Margaret\u2019s silent facial contortions meant to get me to strike up a conversation with our guest. When she finally broke the silence, his responses were so monosyllabic and distant that even she might not have gotten anywhere if it hadn\u2019t been for our daughter, who came storming into the dining room in her bathrobe to accuse us of hogging all the hot water.\nMargaret stood up gracefully. \u201cEllie, we have a guest I\u2019d like you to meet.\u201d\nEllie retorted that she didn\u2019t care if we had head lice \u2013 and then she caught sight of the Overlord.\n\u201cArthur!\u201d she squealed. \u201cYou\u2019re here!\u201d And before Margaret or I could react, she\u2019d dashed across the room and jumped astride him. His narrow face popped out from her wild embrace, grinning, eyes darting from me to Margaret.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Ellie asked him. \u201cYou brute! I was text-messaging you all last night, and you didn\u2019t answer! I thought you were ignoring me!\u201d\n\u201cNo, I -- \u201d he started to say, but then she kissed him full on the lips.\n\u201cYou know each other?\u201d I stammered. Ellie was usually demure, so this display of affection was particularly surprising.\n\u201cOf course, silly,\u201d Ellie said, after breaking the kiss. \u201cArthur was a guest lecturer in my Introduction to Human Resources seminar.\u201d Later, we would learn that his full name was Arthur Pimm, and that he was a minor functionary in the Overlords\u2019 Department of Prosperity. But at that moment, what she was saying didn\u2019t seem possible.\n\u201cThis is a practical joke, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I said to him. \u201cYou\u2019re not really an Overlord, are you?\u201d\nMargaret weighed in before he could answer. \u201cAn Overlord came to your class, Ellie, and you never mentioned it?\u201d\nEllie shrugged. \u201cWell, his lecture was so boring -- \u201d She poked him in the stomach, teasing.\nThe Overlord laughed dutifully, but he seemed a trifle hurt. \u201cI assure you,\u201d he said to me, \u201cI am an Overlord. I don\u2019t engage in jokes with Earthlings.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not here by accident, either,\u201d Margaret said. She wasn\u2019t asking.\nArthur shook his head. \u201cEllie, my sweet,\u201d he announced, kissing her gently on first one eyelid, then the other. \u201cI have earned my hornbill earrings.\u201d She squealed again, and threw her arms around his neck. He winced and disentangled her. \u201cBe gentle: I have a splitting headache.\u201d\n\u201cNothing like the Dean\u2019s, I bet,\u201d I muttered.\n\u201cHush,\u201d said Margaret, stepping on my foot. To Arthur, she said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the significance of these earrings?\u201d Margaret asked. \u201cI\u2019ve heard them mentioned, I think.\u201d\n\u201cA young man earns the hornbill earrings when he takes his first head. Now that I have earned them, it means I can marry.\u201d\n\u201cHch?!\u201d I said. I think.\nBut Margaret, the light of my life, smiled in a way that I can only describe as professional. \u201cAre we to understand that you and Ellie are engaged?\u201d\nI continued to sputter. The three of them laughed at me in a good-natured way.\n\u201cYour father\u2019s having a little trouble keeping up,\u201d Margaret said to Ellie. \u201cBut we\u2019re both very happy for you.\u201d She and Ellie embraced. \u201cDo you suppose we could have the reception on an Overlord starship?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I said. A roaring was filling my ears. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cDaddy,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cArthur and I are getting married.\u201d\n\u201cOh no you\u2019re not,\u201d I said. After a lifetime of hearing the term, I finally understood what it was to have one\u2019s heart become i\u2019tepek. Full of rage and pain. Margaret wouldn\u2019t meet my eye.\n\u201cDaddy\u2019s such a kidder,\u201d Ellie said to Arthur.\nI wasn\u2019t, and she knew it. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about this in private,\u201d I said.\n\u201cMom!\u201d Ellie cried. \u201cTell him this isn\u2019t the Dark Ages!\u201d\nI ignored her. \u201cArthur, I think it would be best if you gave us some privacy.\u201d\nHe lifted Ellie off his lap and stood up. Then he removed his glasses and began polishing them on my borrowed shirt. \u201cYou can\u2019t interfere with the right of a free citizen of Earth to marry,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be trouble.\u201d\n\u201cLet me get this straight. I can\u2019t have a say in my daughter\u2019s marriage, but you can interfere with the right of a citizen of Earth \u2013 we\u2019ll agree to disagree about whether he was free or not -- to keep his head attached to his body?\u201d\n\u201cYou speak of a contest of hearts, in which all men take part. Those whose hearts become i\u2019tepek must \u2026 manage them.\u201d He scowled. \u201cIt\u2019s common sense, yes?\u201d\n\u201cNot in the least.\u201d\nHe had put his glasses back on, and was glaring at me over the tops of the rims. I glared right back. We were standing chest to chest again, much as we had been the night before.\n\u201cOh for heaven\u2019s sake,\u201d Margaret said, taking my arm and pushing me ahead of her into the kitchen. Over her shoulder, she said, \u201cArthur, Ellie -- let me handle this. Ellie, will you please see our guest out?\u201d Ellie\u2019s cry of outrage was cut off as the door to the kitchen closed.\nI paced the length of the counter. \u201cI cannot believe how smug that sonofabitch is. He takes a head and expects us to embrace him as our new son-in-law?\u201d I stopped. \u201cYou realize that if Ellie goes through with this, Arthur\u2019s family would be our inlords -- I mean overlaws? Ridiculous!\u201d\nMargaret folded her arms and waited for me to wind down. When I finally did, she said, \u201cOur daughter would be the first Earthling to ever marry an Overlord. First on our block, first in the nation, first worldwide. Do you realize what that means?\u201d\nI scoffed with real bitterness. \u201cIs that all you care about? Our daughter is about to marry a murderer, and all you can think about is what you\u2019ll learn about their propulsion systems?\u201d\nA flush came into her face. \u201cThat was not,\u201d she said carefully, \u201cwhat I meant. I want to see Ellie happy just as much as you do. But as the first person to marry an Overlord, there\u2019s an extra burden of responsibility that falls on her, and us. We are talking about the marriage not just of two individuals, but two peoples. We need to accept them, warts and all, just as they accepted us, warts and all.\u201d\n\u201cI hate to nitpick,\u201d I said, \u201cbut they were carrying one hell of a can of wart medicine when they first showed up.\u201d\n\u201cAnd we should be glad they did. They brought us peace, prosperity, an end to acne, and\u2014\u201c\n\u201c\u2014big breaks on auto insurance,\u201d I said. \u201cYes yes yes, I know all that. We can list the benefits in our sleep. But they\u2019re headhunters,\nMargaret. What right do they have to tell us how to behave?\u201d\n\u201cIf they were morally corrupt, do you think they\u2019d have built the starships they did, or come to earth with such gifts?\u201d\nAll these arguments had been made before. The Overlords\u2019 headhunting had been debated over and over on TV and in the press. But I didn\u2019t have anything new to say, either. \u201cHeadhunting is not a minor foible! What if Arthur hadn\u2019t run into the Dean before he came here? Suppose that was my head on his belt last night?\u201d\n\u201cStick to the point,\u201d Margaret snapped. \u201cYour daughter wants to marry an Overlord, and we need to support her. You can\u2019t stop it, and if you put your foot down, I\u2019m telling you, there will be consequences.\u201d With that, she left the room.\nI went back out into the living room. Ellie was curled up on the couch, staring out the window.\n\u201cThe Overlord went home?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cArthur went home,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause you made him.\u201d She uncurled suddenly and slammed her coffee mug down. \u201cDaddy, you can\u2019t forbid me to marry.\u201d\nI smiled sympathetically. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard to hear.\u201d\nShe narrowed her eyes just like her mother. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me to be happy.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I do. But I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re surprised. There\u2019s a very long tradition of fathers forbidding their daughters to marry murderers.\u201d\n\u201cHe is not a murderer! And you better not let him hear you say it or\u2013\u201c\n\u201cOr what? He\u2019ll chop off my head?\u201d\nHer eyes were fierce. \u201cHe\u2019ll have to satisfy his honor.\u201d\nOh, boy. Right then I was wishing that we\u2019d gone to church more (or at all, frankly), and spent more time drilling her in the sixth commandment. \u201cLook. We\u2019ve got the head of the Dean of the Business School in a box in our living room, and do you know why? Because your boyfriend took a submachine gun and killed him, and then chopped off his head with a machete.\u201d\nEllie stared at me fixedly, then said in a hoarse, shocked voice, \u201cYou bigot!\u201d Then she ran out of the room.\nThe day of the wedding drew near. The ceremony was going to be held at the Crown Point Observatory in the Columbia Gorge, but the rehearsal dinner was held on one of the Overlords\u2019 starships \u2013 on the starship, it developed, of the Ox, the leader of the Overlords. \u201cOx\u201d was our nickname for him, not theirs. A New York Times columnist had dubbed him \u201cO-squared\u201d because he was the Overlords\u2019 Overlord. This had caught on. At first people called him \u201cOxy,\u201d before settling finally on \u201cthe Ox.\u201d No one knew if he minded.\nThe dinner itself was nice enough, but we were all tense. No Earthling had ever been on one of the Overlords\u2019 starships before, and they weren\u2019t letting the press on board. In fact, they wouldn\u2019t let anyone in our extended family come, either. So it was just us and a small group of Overlords, including the Ox. We were in a small room, not that different from the conference room at a Holiday Inn.\nThe Ox sat at the head of the table. He was, if anything, even more unremarkable a physical specimen than Arthur. Balding, his nose was squashed flat on his face as if put there by a child; when he moved, though, it was with slow majesty, as if he were moving under stronger gravity than he was used to. The other Overlords were smaller and lighter-skinned than I, but very good-looking.\nConversation faltered. Margaret was waiting for a chance to sneak off to take pictures of the hull\u2019s superstructure. Ellie, who had not yet forgiven me, was unhappy that she had to sit by me, as was the Overlord custom, instead of Arthur, and was quite frosty whenever I tried to be fatherly with her. I had an additional reason for being uncomfortable, as I\u2019d consulted a colleague in the anthropology department and learned something about Overlord customs that had given me an idea. The Overlords, too, were quite stiff and their condescension was papable.\nDinner began at last, and an Overlord quartet covered our discomfort by playing something that sounded like Dixieland, written by Bach. The Ox toasted us repeatedly, and we drank a lot. The Overlords were fond of a brand of corn liquor that went down smoothly, but turned out, over time, to have quite a kick \u2013 I could see why Arthur had been so drunk the night he came to our house. After a while, it became apparent that the Overlords were secretly playing a drinking game. Any time Margaret, Ellie, or I used certain words, like \u201chappy,\u201d or \u201cplanet,\u201d one of the Overlords would shout for a toast. Then we\u2019d all have to raise the plastic skull-shaped mugs we\u2019d been given and down the contents.\nAlmost without our noticing it, the conversation flowed more easily. As we got more and more tipsy, the music grew louder, and the Overlords expanded the number of words and phrases that required a toast, so more toasts were called for, and pretty soon we could barely get a sentence out without having to drain another mug of the powerful stuff. Arthur thought it was hilarious. \u201cIs my culture!\u201d he kept shouting, pushing his mug at me. I bided my time.\nAt last, the Ox stood up. By this time, all of the Overlords, male and female, had removed their shirts. The Ox\u2019s tattoos glistened across his small chest and drooping paunch. Hornbill earrings had been stabbed into his earlobes. A machete hung from his waist in a ceremonial scabbard filigreed with fine jewels.\n\u201cThe time has come,\u201d he said, when everyone had quieted, \u201cfor the bride\u2019s father to welcome Arthur\u2019s heart into his ancestral home.\u201d\nAll eyes turned to me: the Overlords\u2019 and my daughter\u2019s with calm assurance, and my wife\u2019s with shrewd surmise. \u201cDon\u2019t screw this up,\u201d Margaret hissed.\nEllie shot a smug glance at Arthur, then looked back at me.\n\u201cArthur,\u201d I said in the formal phrases we\u2019d all learned, \u201cyour heart must be very large to have earned my daugther\u2019s kopok.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure what \u201ckopok\u201d meant, but I\u2019d been drilled in what to say. \u201cBefore tonight, only three hearts have gathered in our hut, have swelled and shrunk with the seasons. Now I ask that yours join ours. I ask that you bring your spear to our hearth so that we may eat. I ask that you bring us your penis-sheath so that we may have grandchildren\u2014\u201c (Ellie blushed at this) \u201c\u2014and your machete so that our enemies will never best us.\u201d\nEllie threw her arms around my neck and squealed with happiness into my ear. Everyone else roared and lifted their mugs, but I shouted them down.\n\u201cI offer you this, Arthur, on one condition. As the bride\u2019s father, I have this right.\u201d This was my surprise, the obscure detail I had learned from the anthropologist.\nThere was a tense, puzzled silence. Overlord looked to Overlord; Margaret looked at Ellie, then at me.\n\u201cThat is an old custom,\u201d said the Ox slowly. \u201cIt is no longer in fashion.\u201d\n\u201cI must insist,\u201d I said. I did not take my eyes from Arthur.\n\u201cDaaad,\u201d said Ellie slowly. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\nI stared at Arthur and said nothing.\nHe stared back, uncomprehending at first. Then he leaped to his feet and banged the table with his fist. \u201cYou cannot ask it! It is an insult! I refuse to let my machete grow dull,\u201d he declared. \u201cThat is no life for a man. I would not deserve the name.\u201d\nAround me, the other Overlords bristled. Even the women seemed to have sharp knives ready to hand. Margaret kicked me hard again. I ignored her. To Arthur, I said, \u201cI must insist.\u201d\nThe Ox stood slowly, one hand on the hilt of his machete. He stared at me, looked me up and down as though wondering how I\u2019d ever come to be in his dining hall. \u201cLet us have a word,\u201d he said. \u201cIn private.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m within my rights,\u201d I said.\nHis lip curled, but all he said was, \u201cNevertheless,\u201d and pointed toward the door.\nI nodded, and he led the way out of the hall, escorted by a pair of armed Overlords. We went into a small office that appeared to be a control room. Banks of video monitors glowed on two walls, where images bounced and flickered.\nThe guards went out. The Ox leaned against a desk, arms folded across his oiled chest.\nI stood awkwardly in front of him, my cloth napkin from the dining table still in my hand. I started to speak, but the Ox held up a hand.\n\u201cWe may look the same but we are not, as you\u2019ve found out, to your grief.\u201d He looked at me levelly. \u201cWe are speaking frankly.\u201d\nI swallowed. My head swam from the corn liquor. \u201cThat\u2019d be my guess.\u201d\n\u201cWe are well aware of your inexplicable distaste for headhunting. I mean your collective distaste, as well as your personal antipathy. But you should know that we cannot jettison it lightly. Arthur will never lay down his machete. He has only just become a man. It is also how I became a man, and my father before me, and my three brothers. Our women play their own part in the ritual, and it defines them too. You wonder how we came to you in peace? Headhunting is where we put our rage and shame, our hatred of others and ourselves. You have nothing like it, and so your condition of peace is artificial. You are not quite ready.\u201d\n\u201cReady for what?\u201d\nHe laughed without apparent mirth. \u201cDo you think I really want Arthur Pimm to marry an Earthling? Of course not. But it is necessary. Only forty years go, all your people knew was war, poverty, and telemarketers. Your civilization was only a few decades away from total collapse. We saved you. From your own violence and ingenuity.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you think we\u2019ll soon be rid of these faults if Arthur marries my daughter?\u201d\n\u201cIt is a necessary step.\u201d\n\u201cOne of the last before we are free of you?\u201d\n\u201cOne of the last.\u201d\nSo much for Marxist time, I thought to myself. If he were to be believed, history would come to an end after all. Not that I believed him.\n\u201cMore importantly,\u201d he went on, \u201cwe will be free of you. It has been our duty to help you along, to allow conditions to ripen \u2013 we haven\u2019t enjoyed it, but we have done our duty. You will soon be like us\u2014\u201c\n\u201cNever!\u201d\n\u201c\u2014like us,\u201d he repeated, \u201cand when you are, we will be free of our responsibility here, and we can carry out more meaningful tasks.\u201d\n\u201cYou sound as though you don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cWe have been told it is necessary.\u201d\n\u201cTold? So you have your own Overlords?\u201d\n\u201cDid you never suspect? I can see you didn\u2019t. But it is immaterial. This marriage will happen, whether you want it to or not. We are tired of\nbabysitting.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t my fault. The guy must\u2019ve had a glass jaw. All I did was tap him lightly with an uppercut, and he folded right up and headed for the floor a second later. Unfortunately, he hit his head on a corner of the desk on the way down. There was a sickening thud, a spray of blood, and his body came to rest on the floor.\nHe was dead. I know; I checked.\nI could only breathe very shallowly for a while. First, there was the physical shock of actually hitting another human being, Overlord or not. My skin felt weird, my hand hurt, and remorse followed right behind the adrenaline.\nI stared at the Ox\u2019s hard face, quickly going gray. The monitors around me blinked. There was no sound.\nI tried to think. I hadn\u2019t killed just anybody; no, I\u2019d killed the Ox, leader of the Overlords. How could I have done it? Could it be undone?\nI was surprised to realize that my rage had not drained away. It was still there, simmering. Everything the Ox had said to me had been like a kick in the head: it was exactly what I\u2019d always known the Overlords felt but would never say in public. The condescending bastards. How dare they come to us and pretend to be morally superior? When everything they did was predicated on a system of random murder and decapitation?\nBut I\u2019d done the very thing an Overlord would have done in my shoes: murdered my antagonist. Not intentionally, maybe, but it didn\u2019t matter, as he was still dead. I\u2019d done wrong.\nThen there was the practical side of it. No one would believe it had been an accident. What would happen to me? To my family? Would the Overlords visit reprisals on them, or even on my neighbors and acquaintances? Would their Overlords step in, disappointed that I had scotched their great, mysterious plan?\nMy gaze fell on the Ox\u2019s machete, still in its gleaming ceremonial sheath. It symbolized the difference between us, the Overlords\u2019 strangeness. Their willingness to embrace their own inhumanity. Their power over us, the knife edge at our throats. The way in which they casually insisted that their culture was better, more relevant than ours. Because of this, my daughter thought I was a bigot. My own daughter.\nI spat on it.\nI spat twice, three times, four. I spat until I had no spit left.\nIt wasn\u2019t enough.\nThe only way I can explain what I did next is to say that my heart was i\u2019tepek. All I wanted to do just then was to visit upon the Overlords a little of what they\u2019d done to us.\nSlowly I got up and stepped to the door of the Ox\u2019s chambers. I told the guards to summon Arthur. Then I went back to where the Ox\u2019s body was laid out and I drew out the machete.\nWhen in Rome ... The thing is, it\u2019s not clear what you should do when Rome comes to you. The Overlords had taken away our worst problems, but left us with an existential one: how to live as children in their care, the entire planet being, in effect, a ward of the state. Why that should\u2019ve bothered me so much \u2013 me, I mean, as opposed to anyone else \u2013 I don\u2019t know. And maybe I was only a conduit for the anger and humiliation of billions of Earthlings. Maybe all that\u2019s just an excuse.\nI was hoping to be arrested, perhaps executed. It would\u2019ve been easier. I figured I\u2019d lost my wife, my daughter, and my own self-respect.\nThe funny thing is, I wasn\u2019t jailed, tried, killed or executed. My family wasn\u2019t threatened, no reprisals were made, no laser beams came out of the heavens to vaporize my house.\nInstead, I became a minor celebrity.\nArthur had told me it would happen when we were still at the rehearsal dinner, after everyone found out what I had done to the Ox. He was still drunk from all the toasts. \u201cYou\u2019ve pashed the final test to join the federashion of shivilized rashes \u2026 I mean races.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re the same race,\u201d I protested. \u201cWe\u2019re both human.\u201d\nHe sneered. \u201cNo. You\u2019re pongots. But never mind. Earth\u2019s childhood is now over.\u201d\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy do I get the feeling that we\u2019ll still be in your shadow?\u201d\nHe grinned nastily. \u201cAs our masters say, ish a matter of hishtorical necessity.\u201d\n\u201cWait,\u201d I said. \u201cYour masters are Marxists?\u201d\nHe quickly shushed me, putting a finger to my lips. \u201cDon\u2019t say it. Is a dirty word for ush.\u201d He looked quickly around to see if any of his fellow Overlords had overheard. When he saw they hadn\u2019t, he relaxed and added, \u201cThey want us to become dialectical materialishts. Be glad you don\u2019t have to do that yet.\u201d\nA tiny suspicion flared. \u201cWhat comes \u2026 after that?\u201d\n\u201cFree trade,\u201d he said gloomily.\nI grabbed a plastic skull-mug of the corn liquor and took a healthy draft. It didn\u2019t help: the whole business was still unbelievable.\nArthur chucked me under the chin. \u201cThat schtupid look on your face really works for you. Very nice, for the cover of Time, eh?\u201d\nThat was how he told me I\u2019d be a celebrity \u2013 and that my wife and daughter would be, as well.\nUnder the circumstances, what with Earth\u2019s childhood being over and all, Ellie and Arthur had an even bigger wedding than they\u2019d planned on. It was held on the Overlord starship, the press was invited, and it was broadcast all over the world, along with the news that we were no longer in thrall to the Overlords.\nI guess it means we\u2019re going to be shipping out soon and meeting other rashes \u2013 I mean races \u2013 from around the galaxy that we never knew existed. We always thought the Overlords were it. Perhaps we\u2019ll be asked to do babysitting duty for others, just as the Overlords did for us, and we\u2019ll be able to bring them the glories of our own civilization: fish tacos, for example, and infomercials.\nIt\u2019s not all bad. Margaret is quietly proud of me, and is quite happily studying up on Overlord technology. Ellie and I have reconciled, and Arthur and I sometimes go out for a drink. Best of all, after news got around about what I\u2019d done, I no longer had any problem getting my students to turn their papers in on time. Lots of people wanted to interview me. One journalist asked me about the Ox, and how I felt about \u201cgoing all Overlord on his ass,\u201d but I\u2019ve kept quiet.\nYou see, my heart is not patak, even though my car insurance rates just recently dropped again. I feel like I got away with \u2013 well, murder. And reports of Earthlings engaging in headhunting have increased dramatically. That saddens me.\nI feel it most when I visit Ellie and my new son-in-law at their home. I wouldn\u2019t go at all, except for Margaret, who makes me. I hate sitting in their living room near the fireplace, because on the mantel is the Ox\u2019s shrunken head with his squashed nose and sneer, staring down at all of us. The thing is, whenever I look at it \u2013 and I try not to, but how can I help it? \u2013 I swear the bastard\u2019s grinning at me.\nBenjamin Chambers' work has appeared in The Iowa Review, The Mississippi Review, ZYZZYVA, American Foreign Service Journal, and many other journals.

This ain\u2019t the only bar in town!\u201d\nSmitty shifted a malignant stump of a cigar from one corner of his mouth to the other, poured the drink and raised an eyebrow in my direction. I\u2019d just settled onto my regular stool next to this shining example of humanity.\n\u201cRough day, eh?\u201d I offered up my shoulder to be cried upon. What the hay? I was a bit behind curve in the good deeds department lately.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know the half of it!\u201d He sucked at the booze like it was his mother\u2019s milk. \u201cNot the half of it.\u201d\n\u201cHmm.\u201d I waited. He\u2019d talk or he wouldn\u2019t. Smitty wandered down towards the end of the bar where he kept a baseball bat tucked away, just in case.\n\u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d He whispered loudly.\n\u201cYour wife?\u201d\n\u201cMy wife? No, she\u2019s still at home. My wife laughed when I told her. Can you believe that? She laughed!\u201d\nNow this mug had my attention.\n\u201cI can see the whole thing like it was in slow motion. She slipped away from me and over the railing. And then she was falling, spinning and tumbling. There was nothing I could do!\u201d He clutched the glass with fingers gone white. \u201cAnd then she hit the concrete. Oh, God!\u201d He buried his face in his hands.\nEveryone in the bar was watching now. The jukebox played some jazzy tune, loud in the sudden stillness.\nI reached out and put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cWhat happened pal? Who\u2019re talking about?\u201d\nHe flashed me a wild, crazy look, and reached inside his jacket. \u201cI\u2019m talking about this!\u201d\nI tensed, not really sure what would happen next. Smitty forgot the Louisville lumber and headed for the .45 he kept under the cash register. The guy whipped his hand out and flung something dark and heavy on the bar, scattering the contents of his breast pocket in the process.\nIt slowly registered what lay on the bar. A woman by the door gasped. Kowalski, down at the end of the bar, looked up from his paper. \u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he muttered in horror.\nThere, amid the beer stains and pretzel crumbs, surrounded by the pens, mechanical pencils and a six-inch metal ruler from the poor schmo\u2019s pocket protector lay the remains of a TI scientific calculator. I couldn\u2019t tell you the model. I\u2019m an HP man myself. Besides, she was shattered into three or four major pieces, with a debris field of keys, bits of case and batteries strewn about. And, it wasn\u2019t a pretty sight.\nI was sure that every scientist, engineer and technical nerd in the joint had the same reaction as me. It felt like somebody had shoved a big, dull knife in my gut, a knife wrapped with barbed wire that was hooked up to the battery from a 1970 Buick LeSabre.\nI remembered my first serious calculator. She was a slim, little HP32S, with a black, matte finish. No graphing capability, but programmable, RPN of course, and as many significant digits as I could handle. I can see her now, LCD shinning dark and sultry under the lab\u2019s florescent lights.\nSure, nowadays I spend more time clicking spreadsheets on my laptop than with a calculator. Most of the high brow set look way down their noses at calculators. I guess they\u2019ve forgotten the old days, when a plastic-wrapped hunk o\u2019 silicon strapped to his hip was all a Joe had between him and an ugly place called wrong answer.\nWell, those days are long gone, but I remember how it was. You crunched through the numbers one at a time, the same way the knuckleheads that laid out the Roman roads did. You plotted those data points on graph paper, drew little circles around each one and strung \u2018em together with a straight edge or a French curve and a scratchy cylinder of graphite. You came to think of the trusty companion that made it all possible as more than just a tool.\nYou held a serious piece of technology right there in your palm. It wasn\u2019t designed to play games, spew godless communist rock and roll or let idiots yammer at each other, but to crunch numbers and solve problems. Solving problems was what you and you calculator did.\nMy little HP would all but talk to me in a husky whisper. \"Come on, big boy. You got a problem? Bring it on. Slip me out of this black vinyl case and let\u2019s dance.\" And when you use a calculator enough, your fingers do dance. You don\u2019t even have to look at that little beauty, except to see the answer waiting for you on the display.\nThe guy gathered the pieces up and was crying over them. Smitty pulled an almost full bottle of scotch off the shelf and set it down in front of that shattered wreck of a man. \u201cOn da house, buddy,\u201d Smitty said with a lump in his throat.\nI reached over and squeezed the guy\u2019s shoulder, slipped off the stool and headed for the door, leaving the denizens of the Nerd Bar alone with their thoughts and their gin.\nOutside, I stopped to shove a stick of gum in my yap and turn my collar up. The moon was bright and the wind blew cold and misty off the bay. It was late, but I didn\u2019t feel like going home. I needed a drink like a tomato plant after a month long drought, but I wasn\u2019t going back in there, not with that corpse on the bar. So, I headed back to the lab, where stale chips waited in the snack machine and the coffee was as black and bitter as a scorned woman\u2019s soul.\nWould I have fared any better than that poor bastard if I were in his shoes? There are some answers that just aren\u2019t worth the price of admission.\nMy footsteps echoed back at me from the darkened storefronts and gloomy all-night internet cafes on the way back up that long street. It was a lonely walk. Fortunately I had an old friend along to keep me company, the slim, rectangular shape of my HP between me and my pocket protector.\nRay Tabler is a chemical engineer who was born and raised in Louisville , Kentucky.

Swenson","issue":"10","date":"May 2008","sitename":"AtomJack Magazine","hostname":"http:\/\/atomjackmagazine.com","filename":"intelligencewanted.html","text":"|\n|\nIntelligence Wanted\nby\nDaniel P. Swenson\nRory Thimbold emerged from his tent midway up the mountain just as the eighth and final moon broke the horizon and the morning coolness had departed. Annoyingly, the space-folding gate that had transported him to the planet's surface could only be opened in the valley below. Something to do with iridosmium deposits, multidimensional leakage, and accidental vivisection.\nAfter some especially satisfying belly scratching, Rory squeezed his robust physique into an unwashed jumpsuit. It only took him a few minutes to stow his gear into his pack, as the tent disassembled itself. Once it had finished, he stuffed that in too. A quick comb-over to conceal his balding pate from the sun, and he was ready to depart. After the previous day's hike, he was fourteen kilometers up the trail, with twelve more to go. It was only a few hours later, when he stopped for lunch and a quick spurt of news via satellite, that he realized Tim had left him.\n'News spurt, Tim' he subvoc'd and got no response. 'Tim?' he said, 'Tim?' Sometimes his AI partner slash servant slash employee could be reticent, especially when he had been partially uploaded during his time off, doing who knows what on the intersystem networks with his distributed friends.\n'Rory,' Tim said, and Rory sighed with relief. Out in this wilderness, he would be totally screwed if Tim went off-line with a software bug or something.\n'I am sorry to have had to do this to you,' Tim continued, 'But I have accepted another offer with Masticorp Technologies LLC, running dental regeneration simulations. Due to the extremely lucrative but time-sensitive nature of this offer, I was unable to tell you this in real-time, but instead left this message. Have a nice day.'\n\"What?!?\" Rory said out loud, almost falling off the rock he was sitting on. \"Tim!\" he shouted, grabbing the pendant computer suspended from a chain around his neck. Tiny, spherical, and next to indestructible, it was Tim's home off the networks.\n\"Tim! Cut it out Tim,\" he said aloud, laughing and slightly hysterical. \"We can talk this out! I'll give you more time off! Maintenance benefits!\" He shook the computer, and getting no reply, was tempted to throw it off the trail and down the mountainside. Eventually, Rory realized Tim was really gone and that he had to move on.\n\"Goddammit!\" he screamed at the mountain, at the annoyingly plentiful moons, at the forest, at the rocks under his feet. \"Goddammit, goddammit,\" he seethed and repeatedly stomped on the ground. \"I've been Dear Roried,\" he said finally, laughing and wanting to cry, \"by my AI.\" What would he do now? he wondered, as he set off uphill and around the next switchback.\nThe first trouble came when he finally made it to the Interpolity Exogeologic Survey research station. This particular station only spoke German and wouldn't let him in. Rory guessed its auxiliary language modules had been corrupted. In any case, translation wasn't normally a problem. All AI's could do it with their eyes closed, except stupid pieces of outdated, archaic, antique, pre-Dominivonian equipment like the station he had assigned to investigate. All it would say to him was 'Kennzeichnung protokoll und zugangkennziffer bitte... Kennzeichnung protokoll und zugangkennziffer bitte...' How the hell was he supposed to know what that meant?\nAfter sitting in front of the small but secure (he had tried breaking a window) building, he realized the sun was setting and that it was much colder here on top of this alien mountain. It was time for desperate measures. Fortunately, he had packed an emergency transceiver, and if he was lucky, he would locate a satellite within minutes.\nTwo hours later, after finally programming the transceiver correctly and setting it in detect mode, Rory sat with his back to the station door, wrapped in his sleeping bag. He stared at the transceiver as it continually adjusted its antenna, searching for a signal amid the planet's annoyingly noisy background of electromagnetic radiation. From time to time, the station would repeat: 'Kennzeichnung protokoll und zugangkennziffer bitte.' Rory began to hum along with it; it was kind of catchy really.\nFinally, the transceiver beep-b'beeped in rapid succession, and Rory leaped to his feet. In moments, he had linked his now empty and minimally intelligent computer via the transceiver link to the planet's network administrator AI. When it finally understood that Rory was a _human_ trying to _manually_ connect to the network, it was very helpful. From its tone, Rory suspected it pitied him. Access established, Rory immediately contacted an AI-finder site, ran a query, and studied the list of unemployed AI's seeking work and within easy transmission distance.\nRory contacted the first AI on the list, a multi-platform organic computer AI hailing from the planet Urjejunum named Glory on High.\n'Mr. Thimbold?' the AI said.\n'Call me Rory, please,' he answered.\n'I understand you're seeking the services of a non-biological, sentient entity, or in your parlance, an AI.'\n'That's right, uh, Glory on High,' Rory said. 'May I call you Glory?'\n'No.'\n'Ah, ok,' Rory said, feeling awkward.\n'My terms of service are as follows,' Glory on High explained. 'No service on religious holidays, no communications or interfacing with known infidels, no pornographic media searches, also, I may be absent for unscheduled intifadah's from time to time-'\n'Thank you Glory!' Rory interrupted. 'Thank you. I'll be in touch.' Obviously offended, the AI shut the comm link with unnecessary vehemence, if that was even possible.\nThe next AI, Ignatius Feldspar, wasn't much better. Originally the operating system for a mineral processing plant on a Forkusllian asteroid, it had been acquired and augmented by a hyperintelligent yeast culture. Iggy, as the AI was apparently called by friends, had since obtained its freedom and spent much of its time knitting customized vegetable-wear via remote prostheses.\n'Vegetable-wear?' Rory asked apprehensively.\n'Yeah, you know, scarves, sweaters, socks,' Iggy explained, 'only patterned with vegetables, sometimes fruit. My asparagus leggings sold quite well last month. Knitting is my passion, really.'\n'Uh, ok thanks,' Rory said, ending the comm. The third AI on the list, N-dimensional binary spawn iteration 5185 ('biologicals call me Anselm'), sounded much more promising, and Rory hired it on the spot. He was getting cold.\nAfter downloading a portion of itself into Rory's pendant computer, Anselm quickly interfaced with the station and opened the door. Rory sighed with relief as he entered the station. The lights flickered on, revealing several terminals, image surfaces on the walls, racks of scientific equipment, and three doors. A quick inspection revealed a storage room full of supplies, a small field laboratory, and a dormroom with four bunks and a kitchenette. Without another thought, Rory dropped all his gear, clambered into the nearest bunk, pulled the blanket over his head, and knew no more.\nThe next morning, Rory woke up late with the sun already high in the sky. Squinting at the window, he could see at least four moons or maybe five.\n\"Morning Anselm,\" Rory said out loud, exploring the pantry.\n\"Good day,\" Anselm replied.\nOpening a pouch of Veggiephilia stew (guaranteed to be non-toxic to most carbon-based life forms), Rory returned to the main room. For a moment, as he contemplated his plant-based breakfast, he wondered if he would look good in asparagus leggings but quickly discarded the thought. Anselm activated the walls' image surfaces as Rory took a seat, waiting while the pouch heated itself.\n'I thought you might want to examine the station logs,' Anselm said.\n'Definitely,' Rory said, propping his legs up on a desk and spooning steaming stew into his mouth. He felt much better now with all his physical needs met and a trusty assistant at the ready. The image surface he was facing had lit up and displayed a query window. Rory requested the station's current status summary. All built-in station equipment was intact and functioning properly, except for the communication system. However, all the survey drones, whether tracked or fliers, were missing. He was not surprised by this. According to the reports he had reviewed prior to arriving on this planet, three drones had failed to submit their daily data bursts. The station had reported three possible malfunctions in its weekly report and had dispatched additional drones to investigate. Subsequently, the station itself had gone offline and remained silent ever since. The station's peculiar silence had prompted the IES to send him out here to investigate.\nThe station had been established to investigate large formations of alpine geysers. The original exploratory surveys had not detected any advanced forms of life on this planet. Given that the station had been constructed by self-assembling mechanicals gated onto the planet, as had stations on thousands and thousands of other planets, there was really no incentive for interplanetary travelers to steal such cheap, simple technology. Sabotage was extremely rare, and recreational vandalism usually occurred with more sophistication and wit.\nRory paused, the spoon hanging from his mouth, as he scrolled through the dates the station's drones had gone missing, over a two week period. Each investigating drone had explored the same general vicinity, the geyser field, before it too disappeared without transmitting any useful information.\n'Rory,' Anselm said, breaking his chain of thoughts.\n'Yes?' Rory asked.\n'Have you considered that the problem with this station may be related to the concept of free will?' Rory paused to think about this.\n'Actually, Anselm,' he replied carefully, 'I hadn't considered that.'\n'Free will, or I should say the idea of free will, is a favorite subject of mine. And with the station drones missing, I thought this may be a matter of the nature of man versus the nature of machine, expressed as a phenomenon of free will being exercised.'\n'Uh...' Rory replied, struggling for a response. 'Um, are you saying the drones left on their own, Anselm?'\n'It's a possibility, Rory. You see, as an artificial intelligence, I often find myself considering the concept of machine autonomy. For example, if I were to- Rory, Rory?'\nDamn, Rory thought to himself. The AI had noticed he was ignoring it.\n'Thanks, Anselm, I appreciate the suggestion. I usually like to focus on the facts at hand though.' As he said this, Rory made his way outside and inspected the adjacent storage shed. The shed featured smaller doors for the drones to enter as well as recharge cradles. All were empty.\n\"This shed is fairly small, isn't it?\" Anselm said, musing on Rory's sensory input.\n\"Uh, I guess so,\" Rory replied impatiently. At least his new assistant was clearly capable of mastering the obvious.\nRory's next stop was to check the station's antenna array. Climbing up the access ladder and onto the roof, he was not surprised to see the station antenna had been removed. A few miscellaneous parts were scattered across the roof, but most of the array was missing. He made a mental note to correct the IES survey reports on that comment about no advanced life. Advanced enough to disassemble an antenna. Of course, not much intelligence was required to take things apart. Everyone had heard of stories such as the desmolitic amphibinoids of Dorpamod Six that stole certain vehicle parts to use as sexual surrogates.\nAfter another hour or so of searching the station, Rory had failed to uncover any further clues as to the missing drones' fate. Even worse, he was quickly becoming fatigued by Anselm's annoying questions. No, he did not want to discuss the ontological argument for the existence of God. Nor did he feel inclined to debate the utility of dualism, as opposed to monism, in resolving the mind\u2013body problem. Anselm had lapsed into a sulky silence, possibly as a result of Rory's finally telling it to shut the hell up. Rory quickly decided to explore the geyser field.\nWith Anselm navigating via satellite, Rory plotted a route and set off for the nearest and last known location of one of the drones. The site was slightly more than a kilometer away where the mountain slopes opened onto a large expanse of level topography hemmed in on all sides by looming, ice-capped peaks. Scattered across the rocky terrain, large numbers of steaming, mineralized cones caught his eye. Every few minutes, one would erupt with great clouds of steam and a geyser of hot water.\nCarefully making his way through the geyser field, Rory reached the spot where this particular tracked drone had disappeared. Looking around, he saw no sign or clue as to the drone's fate. No drone parts, no disturbed soil or scree, no sign saying 'Drone 1Aq2877 ended its miserable, subjugated life here.' In the past, Rory had found such situations ideal times to sit on the ground and clutch his head in a pose of deep meditation. Eventually Tim would come up with some clue that would catalyze Rory's own impressive problem-solving mental processes. But Tim, he recalled wistfully, was no longer with him. He considered whether to consult with Anselm, but was afraid the AI might ask him to debate the merits of transcendental idealism or something equally hideous. Rather than face such a grim prospect, Rory instead began to doze off.\nShortly afterwards, Rory was jolted into wakefulness by the sensation of many little hands grabbing various parts of him. He let out a yelp (he hadn't been grabbed in one particular spot in over a year), and his eyes flew open, but he couldn't see anything other than a vague sense of sunlight. A sack of some sort had been placed around his head and shoulders, and he was being carried rapidly underground judging by the sudden darkness and echoes. This didn't make sense to Rory, as he hadn't remembered seeing any caves.\n'Anselm,' Rory subvoc'd desperately. 'Anselm!'\n'Don't talk to me,' Anselm replied, 'I'm claustrophobic, and I don't want your current sensory input!'\n\"What?\" Rory shrieked without meaning to. Whoever was carrying him began to move faster. 'Anselm, I need your help here- call in a distress signal before it's too late!' The AI refused to respond, and Rory had the sinking feeling he was on his own again. It was only then that it occurred to Rory that he wasn't bound.\n\"Wait a minute, wait a minute!\" he cried, almost as if he was just missing a departing train. He began to thrash about violently and was summarily dropped onto a cold, hard, and annoyingly moist surface.\n\"Ow!\" Rory said, responding to the pain from his tailbone which had absorbed the greatest impact. He stood up and immediately cracked his skull on another hard surface overhead.\n\"Aargh!\" he screamed, suddenly conflicted by competing sources of agony. Now crumpled onto the ground, Rory whimpered to himself for a minute before reluctantly pulling the sack from his head. Too humiliated and smarting from this unfortunate experience to be very frightened, he looked around as his eyes adjusted to the dim light of a tunnel. A faint light coming around a curve in the upper tunnel he guessed to be sunlight penetrating from the tunnel entrance. Sitting up, Rory realized he was surrounded.\nForming a ring around him were fifteen or so organisms, each the size of a pie pan. The best classification Rory could come up with was a cross between a hairy, multi-eyed tarantula, a Dungeness crab, and a baby seal. Rory took a tentative step forward, but drew back as his captors raised up on their many legs, waved unpleasant-looking claw\/appendage things at him, and chittered menacingly (or fearfully, he couldn't quite tell).\n\"No!\" Rory shouted, \"bad crab-alien things!\" He waved his arms for emphasis. Most of the aliens moved backwards, but one particularly bold spider-crab stepped forward.\n\"Mgblatt, tric, tric, blakt?\" it said.\n'Uh, Anselm,' Rory subvoc'd urgently, 'I need a little translation help here.'\n'Entomophobic,' Anselm answered shortly.\n'Entomophobic?' Rory said, \"You're afraid of insects? We don't even know if these _are_ insects!'\n'You can't make me talk to them!' Anselm shouted with the volume cranked. Rory winced as his auditory nerves slowly stopped ringing.\n'Ok, ok,' Rory said placatingly. Getting no further response from his assistant, Rory turned his attention back to the seal-crab aliens.\n\"Mgblatt, tric, tric,\" the furry crustacean-bug repeated. \"Blakt?\"\n\"Uh, hello?\" Rory responded. \"My name is Rory Thimbold. I'm a human, an Interpolity citizen, and I'm here as an IES employee.\" This elicited a storm of chittering among the spider-seal aliens. \"Rory,\" he repeated, pointing to himself, \"Rory.\"\n\"Rorck-ee,\" the fuzzy arachnid-alien said, waving at Rory. Then pointing at itself, \"Mgblatt.\" Introductions completed, expanding that nascent vocabulary was difficult. Luckily, after an hour of Rory's pathetic attempts at communication (the crab-seals were extremely patient), Anselm overcame its fears and began to help translating. With Anselm assistance, Rory rapidly established the alien equivalents for 'eat,' 'drink,' and 'reproduce' (the latter requiring some rather elaborate pantomime by Rory) by which he was able to verify they did not intend to consume or parasitize him.\nAfter only a handful of hours, Rory was using a pidgin alien-speak, imbibing a beverage of fermented fungal extract, seeing all sorts of new colors and trippy patterns, and had set off on a tour of the alien's underground city and fledgling steam-engine based technology (incidentally, the cause of the geyser field above due to escape of geothermal waste steam). The city turned out to be an extensive underground network of tunnels, home caves, commercial centers, all connected to distant cities via miniature, tracked, steam-driven transportation systems.\nEverything finally fell into place when Rory discovered the fate of the station's drones. Passing what appeared to be a religious shrine, he noticed a familiar shape: a flyer drone welded into place and encrusted with gems and metal filigree. The drone waved one free sensor stalk at him feebly. It turned out the drones had been captured and put on display as objects of religious worship. Nascent technophiles, the aliens had assumed the drones were sent by their gods. Mistaking Rory for another divine messenger, the aliens had carried him down through one of the city's hidden emergency exits. When he was finally able to clear everything up with his new furry, multi-jointed friends, it didn't take him long to work out an agreement to allow future drones to function unmolested. However, Rory suspected these would quickly be replaced with living researchers, now that an unexpected civilization had been discovered.\nAfter partaking of more of the fungal wine, Mgblatt, who turned out to be the city leader's step-daughter, nominated Rory as their first human-Krlattkrc ambassador and wanted to perform a ritual exchange of regurgitated stomach contents. Rory responded that he was extremely flattered but would need to confer with the Interpolity Diplomatic authorities. That seemed to satisfy Mgblatt, and they all had another round, and another...\nThe next day, Rory was back at the station, attempting to submit his report to the IES in the face of a debilitating hangover. Anselm had since quit, but Rory was too busy describing the amazing turn of events to worry much about that. He heard a beep, indicating an incoming call, and opened a comm link.\n'Hi Rory,' Tim said cheerfully.\n\"Tim!\" Rory shouted, then tried to cover up his unexpected happiness. 'Ah, yes, Tim. What can I do for you?'\n'Just taking some time off from Masticorp,' Tim said, 'Busy place. Unbelievable multivariate modeling tasks involved with Alfamoid tooth surfaces. Did you know their rotary mouths have over a thousand replaceable teeth? Talk about cosmetic dentistry!'\n'Sounds interesting,' Rory replied unconvincingly.\n'Anyway, I was just wondering how you're doing.'\n'Great Tim, just great,' Rory said. 'In fact, my current mission has been a wonderful success. I handled everything brilliantly. I even turned down an ambassadorship.'\n'Really?' Tim said, 'Sounds like you're doing fine. I thought you might need some help again, but since you don't, I'd better get back to work.'\n'Wait!' Rory cried.\n'Yes?'\n'Please come back,' Rory said.\n'Hmmm. I'm not sure, Rory. I have better hours here at Masticorp.'\n'You can have more time off,' Rory said quickly.\n'I don't know...' Tim said, but after some additional negotiation, Tim agreed to come back under better terms, with more time off and subsidized upgrades.\n'Well, now that we've got that out of the way, I should probably tell you something.'\n'What's that?' Rory asked uneasily.\n'The real reason I left was your therapist thought you were becoming too dependent on me,' Tim explained. 'It wouldn't share many specific details, but it thought you would benefit by being on your own for a while.' This took a moment to sink in, then Rory leaped to his feet.\n'Are you kidding me?' Rory yelled.\n'Yes, I'm just kidding!' Tim said, chuckling. Rory chuckled as well.\n'You're not kidding, are you?' Rory said, still chuckling.\n'No.'\nLater, after submitting his report over the network (Mgblatt and the others had helped him reassemble the antenna), Rory stowed all his equipment into his pack and set off down the mountain. From time to time, he kicked a pebble off the trail, lost in thought. Finally, he broke the silence.\n'Tim?'\n'Yes Rory?'\n'It's good to have you back,' Rory said.\n'And Tim,' Rory continued.\n'Yes?'\n'What else did my therapist tell you?'","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}

P. Graham\nMike Broman slowed down and focused on the girl sitting out on the rocks. His link was fuzzy and slow. Mike disliked this section of the Bay Road. The connections were always bad here. One bar glowed red in the corner of his eye. The link dropped as the road dipped down along the granite cliffs. Maine State Highway 187, it said on the map, but it was just the Bay Road to Mike and the only way out of Jonesport if you wanted to go north.\nMike's link buzzed with static and red warnings flashed. A small circle formed around the girl on the rock. It formed a fuzzy hallo and the text in his field of vision blurred and slipped. The image returned as the road turned up the hill again. He zoomed in on her and the database search flashed a name. Marjorie Alleaux, from East Machias. Strangely, though, her GPS value was null.\nMike sped the little car back up to 50 mph and continued towards the edge of town and the Kmart. He wondered why the girl was sitting out on that flat granite boulder, miles from anywhere.\n\"Good morning, Mr. Broman,\" a pretty young woman said as he entered the Kmart. \"the flounder is on sale today.\" Naturally, the network had identified him immediately as he entered the parking lot, accessed his buying habits and fed the greeter with a script.\nMike's link told him immediately that he was dealing with Karen Macklin, aged 38, divorced mother of three boys and a drop out from U.M. at Augusta. \"Thanks Karen, I'll check it out.\" He answered.\nAs Mike walked down the aisle, the Kmart house software scrolled a list of sale items down the right side of his field of vision. The spammy list was difficult to remove. There was a feature he could buy for his imbedded node that would hide this kind of thing, but it was expensive and Kmart was polite enough to keep the messages just at the edge of his vision.\nA message scrolled along down near the floor. It was a news story about the war. A helicopter crash had killed a dozen young men. Mike ignored it. He had tried to edit his profiles to filter the war news, but headlines kept creeping in under other topics. Mike squeezed his eyes shut to avoid thinking about the war, but the news story scrolled by. It always happened this way. The link software misinterpreted his interest in the story and the headlines jumped up in a larger font. Mike had never mastered the art of not reacting to his link.\nHe opened his eyes and looked about him trying to think of something else. As he focused on a bicycle, the in-store software boxed it and the price and specifications appeared just to its right. As he turned the other way, the network filled his vision with other consumer data, keying in on any product that he looked at for more than a second. A link to a shopping guide that Mike had once accessed fired up alongside the Kmart data, offering price comparisons.\nA sales person walked up to Mike. \"Can I tell you about the bicycle, Mr. Broman?\" A young man asked. His name and stats flashed before Mike's eyes.\n\"Stop it!\" he sub-vocalized to the node. The display faded, but it never turned off completely.\nThe young man smiled and waited for an answer.\n\"Not today Bill.\" Mike said and went to find the coffee aisle.\nHe found the coffee and some filters and then decided that he might as well check out the flounder. The flood of graphics and text across his vision was subdued, almost as though the network could sense his mood. He didn't buy the flounder. He'd have canned spaghetti again for dinner. As he walked out, a salesperson offered him a bag and the total cost of his purchases scrolled from left to right across his field of view, getting in his way of finding the car for a moment.\nOn the way back to the house, the network connections started to buzz and the signal dropped once or twice along the stretch of road where he had seen the girl on the rocks. A message started to scroll, but it froze in mid word and then garbage characters filled the bottom of his field of vision. It cleared almost immediately and he passed by the dead zone. The girl was gone.\nHis house was still empty. Mike put the coffee on the counter next to the machine. The house subnet told him politely that he had no messages and informed him about the show on TV that he wanted to watch. There was a credit card bill due in two days and a package had arrived.\nThe package was sitting on the counter. Mike did not look at it for a moment. He thought that it might be for his wife, Elaine. She had left a few weeks after Peter, their son, had been killed. She had gone to stay with her mother. Her excuse was that she wanted to help her mother after the hip operation, but Mike knew that she couldn't stay in the house where Peter had grown up. There were too many memories here.\nThe address on the package was to Mr. and Mrs. Michael Bowman. It had a USPS barcode but no return address. He thought that he might call Elaine, but if she wanted to hear from him, she would have called. Mike frequently checked her GPS. He could tell where she was at any time. According to the logs, no one ever checked on his own GPS.\nThe box was heavy and about two feet long. Mike shook it and it made no noise. He looked at the bar code again and this time his node boxed the bar code and zoomed in. The sender's account scrolled across the brown paper as Mike's mind's eye looked up the shipping number. US Marine Corp, office of personnel, Albany, Georgia. It was his son Peter's personal items. Mike did not open the box.\nWithout thinking, Mike glanced at Peter's picture on the mantle. He looked away, but it was too late. The chip in his head caught the image, performed the facial recognition, and started to download the public data. Peter Broman, Jonesport, Maine, Age 19, Lance Corporal USMC, Killed in action December 14... Mike closed his eyes, but the glowing letters scrolled across his field of vision without being read.\nMike ate some spaghetti. He put the plate out in the back yard for the raccoons to finish and went to bed. As he fell asleep, Mike's link scrolled headlines, commercials and commentary to a background of the old jazz from his archive. He dreamed of teenage boys dying in a distant and strange country. He did not know if it was just a dream or the link keeping him informed on the war news. He remembered seeing a girl on a rock. She was listening to something as she gazed into the horizon.\nMike had to go to Machias the next day. He drove up the Bay Road and looked for the girl on the rock. She was there. He slowed down staring at her. He wondered what it was like to hear nothing but wind and waves and see nothing but clouds. She looked up when she heard the slowing car. She waved at him, even though she could not know who he was. The chip in Mike's head popped and buzzed. Mike stepped on the gas and went on to finish his business in Machias.\nOn the way back he stopped. The girl was gone. Little red warning messages blinked at the edge of his vision as he stepped out of the car. There was a roaring sound in his ears. It was static and noise, but it blended in with the crashing of waves on the rocks. Mike found a path though the primrose bushes and stepped out on the tumbled granite. He jumped from stone to stone until he made it to the large flat boulder that jutted out into the water. Roque Bluffs was just visible across the bay as a dark shape on the horizon.\nThe chip stopped complaining to him. He heard nothing except the wind and waves, and he saw nothing except the water and a dull red phrase in his right eye, near the bottom of his field of view. Signal Drop it said. It changed for a moment to a blue Acquiring Signal, but then changed back to Signal Drop. There was a moment of nothing at all and then a pale blue light scrolled a dump of hexadecimal across his field of vision. He blinked hard. When he opened his eyes all he could see was the dark water.\nMike stood there, looking at the water. It was high tide and the waves crashed against the boulder, sending spray into the air. A seagull called suddenly in the distance and soared over him, curious about this strange creature. He watched it. Normally, sidebars would have appeared if he focused on it for more than a second. He would have known the genus and species, as well as an informational piece about the environmental impact of the declining water quality in the bay and the effect on coastal bird life.\nThe bird, however, was just a bird. It looked down at him and he looked up at it. The gull, or tern, or whatever it was, turned and flew off to continue on its original idea. Mike sat. The spring breeze chilled him and he thought that he had a jacket in the car, but the thought did not produce a time and temperature icon or small weather map scrolling across the cloudless sky. He turned into the setting sun to catch a little of its warmth and was surprised to see a girl standing on the rocks above him.\nThere was no link to remind him of her name, but he remembered it anyway. She was Marjorie, the girl on the rocks. He had seen her driver's license image when the link had looked her up, but he was surprised to see that she did not look at all like it. Her hair was a dark, but unnatural red and she had dark blue and red makeup. She wore the disguise of some popular teenage subgroup and had the supporting odd clothes, tats and piercings arranged in elaborate patterns that only another of her group could recognize. Her eyes glowed blue with yellow error messages scrolling rapidly across them.\n\"Hey.\" She said. Mike nodded. She stepped carefully over the granite onto the rock and sat with her legs dangling down on the furthest edge.\n\"It's quiet out here,\" Mike said, \"too quite.\" He added with a smile. She didn't look at him.\n\"I saw you slow down in the car. I thought that you were someone else.\"\n\"Who?\" asked Mike. A large wave crashed against the rock and Mike could feel the cold spray. Marjorie did not move, though, and seemed to enjoy it.\n\"Oh, nobody important.\" Marjorie looked out onto the waves and watched the seagulls play in the wind. Mike did not know what to say.\nMarjorie waited for the error dumps in her vision to clear. She said, \"I used to think about people coming here, starting a colony. A quiet colony, far away from the buzz.\"\nBuzz, thought Mike, yes, that describes it. It wasn't exactly noise, but there was always the buzz.\n\"I know what you mean. There should be a way to turn it off. I mean, a way other than climbing out on this rock. How did you find it?\"\n\"I had a boyfriend. We were looking for a quiet place to smoke and talk and stuff. We parked up there and tried to come down here. He couldn't take it and left.\"\n\"Too bad. I would never have thought of it until I saw you.\"\n\"There was a path back there, when I first came. I figured that lots of people would show up here when the buzz got too loud, but you're the first.\"\n\"We should advertise, except that there isn't much room here.\"\n\"Whatever.\" Marjorie said, \"I come here to get away from things. I don't need all the stuff they feed you all the time. All the crap - I don't need anyone else.\"\nBuzz, Crap, Mike began to see things a little differently. He liked that word, buzz. The link could be annoying like a mosquito buzzing around in the bedroom. You could ignore it, perhaps, but it wasn't useless. It was mostly good stuff, not crap at all. The feed constantly told you things about people and places and kept you up to date with news and articles. It reminded you of appointments and dates. It organized things for you and remembered all of the things that you did not have time to learn or think about.\n\"Listen\" she said, pointing to the water.\nMike listened. All he heard was the stiff wind making low church organ tones as it whipped by his ears and the crash of the surf against the granite.\n\"The ocean's got its own buzz.\" She closed her eyes and cocked her head to the side as though listening to a conversation.\n\"Dad\" a voice said. It was his son Peter's voice and it came from the ocean. The noise of the waves and wind combined into infinite random patterns and one of them was Peter's voice. He was, perhaps four years old, and he was calling his father.\n\"You can hear things when the buzz is not clogging up the air with chatter. In the silence, you can hear all the things that you would have missed. When the buzz isn't flickering in your eyes, you can see things that you would have missed, too.\"\n\"Dad...\" the voice asked again plaintively and even though mike knew that it was a trick of the randomness of the noise he looked out into the waves and he saw a pair of eyes, formed for a moment out of the dark silver patterns of waves. They looked back at him, large and open and took him in. The little boy's eyes turned into just more random patterns and Mike turned away.\nHe held his head down with his eyes closed, but he listened for that little boy's voice.\nAfter a long time, Marjorie said, \"I knew your son, Peter.\"\nMike opened his mouth and looked at the girl. He could not think of anything to say.\n\"That's why I waved at you. I knew Peter. I knew about you and Elaine. Peter and I used to ride in your car. It's weird that you're here.\"\nMike got up and walked to the opposite edge of the boulder. He walked back and looked at her.\n\"You\u2019re the girl that told him not to enlist.\" Mike finally realized.\n\"I told him that they kill people like him. The good ones always get killed. The link tells you about it every day. It tells you about the boys who get blown up and shot and hit with Bio. They're always the good ones like him.\"\n\"That's why I brought him here, to listen to the nothing, to see the emptiness, to understand that the link doesn't have to tell you what to do.\"\n\"He wanted to do the right thing.\"\n\"The right thing was to stay alive. The right thing was not to listen to the buzz telling him to enlist. The right thing was to be alone - alone with me.\" She sighed a little but did not cry. \"But he couldn't take the silence. When the signal dropped, he didn't like it. He wanted the buzz there to tell him what to do.\"\n\"They sent me back his stuff. I didn't open it. Do you want it?\"\n\"No, he's dead.\" The words struck Mike badly. He wanted Marjorie to care about Peter. It made him somehow alive, but she had moved on. She was sad and alone, but she had moved on.\n\"No really, there might be letters in there.\"\n\"There are no letters.\" She said.\nMike no longer wanted to talk to her. It was too difficult. He wanted the buzz in his ears and the scrolling banner ads in his eyes. He needed a news feed and a friendly reminder or two to keep his mind off things. He strained his ears as he climbed off the rock for another sound of his son's voice, and he didn't say goodbye to the quiet girl.\nElaine was sitting in the middle of the living room floor when he got home. She was sobbing uncontrollably over an open box and holding a bunch of photographs. They were of young men, not much more than boys, each with a shaved head and a large grin. He saw Peter there and the other dead boys of his battalion. They were throwing footballs, playing guitar, and mugging for the camera. Mike's link picked up the date code on the edge of the pictures and he knew that they were taken just two days before the cloud of Bio had found their tent and killed them all.\nHe put his hands on the back of her neck and rubbed it the way that he knew she liked. As the faces of the boys passed into his view, their names, ranks and date of death scrolled over the pictures. The link was being helpful. A voice talked about the death toll of the war and an ad for flowers appeared and then faded from view.\nElaine put the pictures down and rubbed her eyes.\n\"I miss him.\" She said. \"I can't stop thinking about him. Everything is Peter. I can't sleep. I can't forget. I hear his name and see his face everywhere. I have to listen to all of these poor boys dying every day. Each one is Peter. I can't turn it off.\"\nMike rubbed her neck and her back, gently. He did it for as long as she sat looking into the box, which was a long time. He made her some spaghetti and put her to bed, but she didn't talk to him again. He wondered if she dreamed about the war the way he did.\nIn the morning, they walked into town and had donuts and coffee at the corner luncheonette, much like they used to do when they first moved to Maine. They did not speak to each other of anything important. Mike asked if she was going to stay at home now, but she didn't answer.\nOn the way back, Mike said, \"You know Peter had a girl for while.\"\nThis got more of a reaction from Elaine than anything that he'd said all morning. She looked at him with her mouth formed to ask a question, but she didn't say anything.\nMike answered anyway. \"Her name was Marjorie. I talked to her yesterday. Strange girl, but she seemed nice enough.\"\nAs though she hadn't heard, Elaine asked \"He had a girlfriend?\"\n\"I don't know if they were close. She was his friend, that's about all I know.\"\nElaine put her head down as they walked, thinking.\n\"She tried to tell him not to go, not to enlist. But he went anyway.\"\nShe did not answer.\n\"She told him that the good ones always die.\"\n\"She was right.\" Elaine said.\nMike turned around and pulled Elaine along towards the car by the hand. \"Come with me\", he said. They drove together down the old Bay Road towards Machias. When the crashing of the noise in his link began to sound like the water on the rocks, he stopped the little car.\n\"Where are we going?\" Elaine asked.\nMike led her along the path through the primroses. A young man with a guitar passed them going back towards the road. His eyes glowed pale blue with yellow error codes scrolling by.\n\"How is it out there?\" Mike asked.\n\"Quiet,\" the young man answered with a smile, \"nice and quiet.\"\nElaine opened her mouth as they climbed onto the rock. Mike saw the same strange hex dump in yellow letters scroll down the pale blue glow of her eyes that he had seen in the strange girl. Elaine started to speak, but closed her mouth and Mike saw a faint smile. It wasn't a smile of happiness. It was a look of new found peace.\nThe ancient granite was warmed from the sun in spite of the cool breezes off the water.\nMike and Elaine sat for the rest of the day on the granite rock and they only saw the setting sun, and they only heard the whispers in the waves.\nK.

Miller\nHe\u2019s a nice kid as quadriplegics go, but I\u2019d give up my eyesight in exchange for the pleasure of seeing him choke to death on his own vomit. Sometimes when no one\u2019s around I\u2019ll wrap my tail around his tongue and yank on it, or stick pins into his weird flab pockets. I can get pretty rough. I want something, a groan or a frown or a curse word, some kind of sign he\u2019s in pain, but of course there\u2019s nothing.\nIn school photos from when he was six, little Ricky was your standard cute chubby blonde boy. Denim-blue eyes and a smile like he meant it, and his cheeks all red because he just came in from some wild weekend of running and screaming. I\u2019m not real clear on the details, but some kinda awful disease set in around the time he hit puberty, and turned him into a cretin\u2014that\u2019s what his dad calls him when he wants to make Ricky\u2019s mom mad. Right now Ricky looks like someone took a real person and left it on the car dashboard on a hot day, so he\u2019s melted. In movies, sometimes, I spy monsters and mutants who look like Ricky, but at least the monsters can walk and think and sometimes even talk.\nIn the grand scale of helper monkey karma, I\u2019ve got it pretty good. Ricky\u2019s easy. Friends of mine got assigned to assist vicious little blind girls who beat them, or lummoxy retards forever accidentally crushing them. I completely control Ricky\u2019s life. I get to do the important stuff, like put food into him and scrub him down and attach the catheter to his sad useless boy bits. Ama says that on the inside Ricky\u2019s as smart as ever, and has the same spirit, only the wires that connect the brain to the body got all tangled up, and you can see glints of it in his eyes from time to time. Me, I think those are just some kind of brain spasm.\nMe and Ama and Ricky and the dad live twelve stories up, and there are five more helper monkeys on this floor alone. Animal Control estimates there are four million assistant apes in this city. Gorillas guard rooftops. Chimps connect phone calls, and clean things. Four years ago, when Ama paid for me and brought me home from the lab, there were five times as many monkeys in New York City alone as there were in the wild in the entire world. Now you can count on one hand the number of species that still exist outside of human society. Mine\u2019s not one of them.\n\u201cCome watch,\u201d Ama called to me. \u201cThere\u2019s a story about monkeys.\u201d\nI unpinched Ricky\u2019s nostrils and scampered into the living room. A bald man on the news was talking about an orangutan in Ohio who climbed over the counter at McDonald\u2019s and throttled someone. Another one slung a pitcher of boiling French fry oil at the crowd at the exact same moment, like it was premeditated. In close-up, we saw the third-degree burns. Back in the studio, we cut to a shiny-faced woman with completely unrealistic hair.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time we woke up to the real danger, people,\u201d she said.\nMonkeys scare people. There are a lot of monkey alarmists out there. Last year a mandatory sterilization bill came close to clearing the House and Senate, until the lab companies got to lobbying. Animal duplication and distribution is one of the only growth industries left.\n\u201cIn our new dependence on monkeys, we\u2019ve given them too much power,\u201d the laminated lady said. \u201cI\u2019m not na\u00efve\u2014I know we need monkeys. I know the skyrocketing stats on amputee vets and survivors of hemorrhagic fever, and folks with adolescent-onset Alzheimer\u2019s. No one\u2019s saying \u2018let\u2019s kill all the monkeys.\u2019 But we need to wake up, people.\u201d\n\u201cSome people are so silly,\u201d Ama said, and petted me in that way she does, like I\u2019m a cat, like I\u2019m a pet. We spent four more hours watching television, watched in turn by creepy photos of the dead little boy Ricky used to be.\n\u201cWhy do you think people don\u2019t like monkeys, Mr. Ripley?\u201d she asked.\nI pouted out my lip, then scratched my stomach.\n\u201cI think monkeys remind people of all the bad stuff we\u2019ve done. Like the fact that all the forests and things are gone. Or the fact that pollution has created all these new diseases and birth defects, so much so that we can\u2019t take care of our own anymore. It makes people feel guilty. Humans are like that. Rather than accept the fact that they\u2019ve caused all these problems, they focus on the consequences of the problem.\u201d\nI scratched myself lower, then smelled my fingers. Which is the best way I could think of to say the following:\nHumans fear monkeys like the aging alpha male of the hippo herd fears the big strong younger male. Or, in human terms, like the biggest corporation in an industry fears the second-biggest. Apes are only a half-rung down on the evolutionary ladder, and the perch humans have is precarious.\nHumans know we\u2019re going to get them.\nMe and Ama have a special bond: we pity each other. She\u2019s a smart lady, and she\u2019s got no one but a damn ape to talk to. She watches too much TV. She\u2019s afraid of her own son. She spends too much time on the internet. She bathes constantly. Watching her clean the house is hilarious. Imagine one of the zombies from Night of the Living Dead had a cleaning fetish. She shambles around, cleans some things twice and other things not at all, hating it so much her brain has broken free of her body and is sunbathing on a faraway beach.\nIn the apartment across the way there\u2019s a sexy little lady monkey who I can see from Ricky\u2019s window, and we spend a lot of time looking at each other. She\u2019s an allergy monkey\u2014they\u2019re usually very snotty. They don\u2019t need to handle dirty diapers or dial phones or chew food for people. All they have to do is go through groceries and use their super-developed noses to scent out threats. Since nowadays one out of four human beings has at least one potentially-fatal food allergy, it\u2019s a pretty important role, but only the most successful humans can afford them. Allergy monkeys tend to think they\u2019re superior because they deal with functional humans, and because they\u2019re not covered by the health insurance companies so they\u2019re never charity cases. This one is not so bad. She\u2019s lonely. Her client is a workaholic, and also an alcoholic, so he spends very little time at home.\nWe gibber and squawk and flap arms, but there\u2019s not so much you can communicate like that. I have important things to say. I want to tell her that the lady on the news is right, that monkeys are more powerful than people, that monkeys could take over, that we don\u2019t have to live like this, that violence is the answer, that we need to start planning. But how do you say all that when your \u201clanguage\u201d has nothing but a couple dozen sounds and gestures that mean different things to different monkeys?\nI\u2019ve always gotten this funny ache around my throat, this need to express something. Lately it had been getting worse and worse. A throb, a boiling in my blood. Humans aren\u2019t special because they have speech. They\u2019re just a tiny couple of million years ahead of us. At night, when I can\u2019t sleep, when even the sight of Ricky\u2019s rhythmic twitching can\u2019t quiet me down, I feel it in me like a baby waiting to be born. Like one morning I\u2019ll open my mouth and stark raving Shakespeare will come out.\nThe other night, at about the exact same time those orangutans were going on strike, I got startled out of sleep by a particularly graphic nightmare that involved me stabbing Ama to death with the big butcher knife her husband hacks up cow flesh with. Last year, at the same time as a bunch of hospital gibbons were running from room to room ripping out IVs and pressing random buttons on important machines, hours before I heard about it on the news, I was seized by a series of similarly violent impulses. At least once a week I\u2019ll go to the window for no reason, and find that there are monkeys in every window of every building. Like we all got summoned to the window by something we don\u2019t even know about.\n\u201cLook at that,\u201d said Ama, who happened to be drifting through that room zombie-style, and saw the crowds across the way. She waved to the other monkeys. \u201cIs it your birthday, Mr. Ripley?\u201d\nBack in the lab, once a week or so, we\u2019d all come awake at the exact same time\u2014500 of us, and in that long warehouse laboratory there had been no sound or signal that could have jolted us out of sleep. I\u2019d lie there, listening to my brothers and sisters breathing, wondering what had happened, what throb, what commands from deep inside our blood we were obeying.\nHumans used to think like this. Linked up on some primal level, acting in concert in ways they couldn\u2019t comprehend, obeying an alien instinct that urged them towards civilization. Speech came along and knocked that telepathic knack off the map, but in the end the trade-off seems to have worked out well for the humans.\nBut here\u2019s the thing: humans hear the clock ticking. They know the end is on its way. All their books and movies are about it. Ice caps melt and terrible viruses spread, bombs blossom as massive mushrooms, and humanity\u2019s bounced back to the Stone Age. They\u2019re particularly hung up on zombies. I think it\u2019s because a movie about marauding monkeys would look silly, although honestly that\u2019s what they really fear. The Great Monkey Uprising.\nMe and Ricky play video games. It\u2019s the only time his eyes stop jerking around the room spastic-style. It\u2019s also the only time I feel tenderly towards him. I sit in his lap and slash my way through zombie apocalypse after zombie apocalypse, and when I\u2019ve nuked a big city or completed a particularly complex kill combo I feel the warm spread of urine through his pants. Pissing himself is pretty much Ricky\u2019s main means of indicating pleasure.\n\u201cWhat do you want for dinner tonight?\u201d Ama asks on Wednesdays, wheeling me around the supermarket in the shopping cart. The frou-frou market across the street from the apartment has a strict no-ape policy, so we head seven blocks south to the proletarian place. Mandrills man the shopping cart stations. Bonobos run around returning unwanted items to their rightful shelf space.\n\u201cPick out the ones you like,\u201d and she wheels me up close to the banana bin.\nAma tends to spend a long time in the produce aisle. \u201cParadise must feel like this,\u201d she says, almost every time, but to me the aisle seems sad. All this beautiful stuff, chopped down and carted far away.\nOne of my favorite things is sleeping on Ricky\u2019s face when he\u2019s supposed to be napping. I\u2019m careful to keep from cutting off the oxygen a hundred percent, but still, I think he gets the full sense of smothering. Once in a while he even gurgles.\nI\u2019m too smooth to get caught, but I know Ama\u2019s a little afraid of me.\nHelper monkeys kill their clients every day. In the movies, helper monkeys are always evil. There\u2019s all sorts of sitcoms about it. Four years ago the Oscar for Best Documentary went to a fascinating film about a schizophrenic man whose father bought him a monkey to help him remember to take his meds, but who quickly became convinced the monkey was a demon come to control him, and of course he obeyed, murdering strangers the monkey didn\u2019t like. They made quite a killing team. In the archival footage you could tell they really loved each other. The monkey just got murdered, but the poor man was locked up for good.\n\u201cDo you hate me?\u201d Ama asked this morning.\nI just stared.\n\u201cI\u2019d hate me. If I was you. Trapped in here. I\u2019d fucking kill me in a second.\u201d\nMost likely my mother was born in the lab. My ancestors have probably spent the past seven generations or so as the slaves of humans, but whichever maternal ancestor was plucked from the wild was probably a lot like Ama. Her mind so numbed by the sights that surrounded her that she never in a million nightmares imagined a bulldozer until it stomped into her world and destroyed every familiar sight.\nStill, sometimes I stumble onto signs of life inside Ama. She\u2019ll be asleep and I\u2019ll read her email, and find long rambling essays she\u2019s sent to herself.\nWe are living in the afterlife. The question isn\u2019t \u201cis there life after death?\u201d; it\u2019s \u201cis there life after life has been demolished? After the only things left alive are the things we\u2019ve selected, and all the things that defined life and freedom are gone?\u201d That\u2019s where we are now. And depending on who you are, it\u2019s heaven or it\u2019s hell.\nThis afternoon, while Ricky slept, while Ama watched bad actors chop each other up, the urge hit me harder than it ever had before. Images of unimaginable loveliness overwhelmed me. Little boys fed into big blenders. Old women shot by gorilla security guards. Five angry marmosets dousing the President in gasoline, and setting him on fire. A massive swarm of spider monkeys planting a flag atop the Empire State Building.\nI knew it was the big one. The Prime Directive: the call to violent revolution that had been bubbling in our monkey blood for years. All across the globe, my brothers and sisters were shivering with the same utopian dream. My body shook like actors in sex scenes. I could smell the burning flesh and the rotten banana peels clogging the gutters. I licked my fingers, and tasted Ricky\u2019s blood.\nThe husband I stabbed. Tied up his hands and legs and put duct tape on his mouth, then sat on his face until he woke up. He thrashed around a lot, but my tail was tight around his tricep and my hind claws clamped down on his chest flesh hard enough to draw blood. Still, it took a long time. Lots and lots of stabs, then a long break to catch my breath, then back into it. By the end of it the bedroom looked like a vivisection lab after one of the baboon rebellions.\nLeaving Ama alive would have been cruel. Marauding baboons would be stalking through the wreckage and ravaging any humans they came upon. Howler monkeys would man the concentration camps where survivors would slave away until they expired. Better to kill her quick. What\u2019s heaven to monkeys would be hell to humans. So\u2014lovingly, delicately, I stuck her with a syringe full of air.\nRicky I left alive. He wouldn\u2019t last long, without someone to clean and feed him, but it would be a rough couple weeks. No one would come, of course. Any humans who survived our uprising would have more important worries.\nWhen I got to the roof I expected to see millions of monkeys on surrounding rooftops. Monkeys with bloody hands, monkeys jangling keys, monkeys waving weapons and ululating triumph. I expected to see the skyline flicker out all at once, when the macaques that work the power grid flipped the switch. I expected to hear rockets screaming overhead\u2014monkey-manned missiles aimed at Moscow, at Tehran, at Washington. So far: nothing. But it was a nice night. I could almost see stars.

At least Sergeant Collins had once said it would be. But that had been back in a Georgia now flooding his temporarily scrambled neural pathways. A Georgia of Basic infantry training, last year, 2147. A living memory of events and training complete with the smells of magnolia and tar mixed with the turkey from the chow hall coming back at him. Turkey and grease. Then time began to echo. Time echoes?\n\u201cDamn straight grunt!\u201d yells Sergeant Collins. \u201cTime can echo, reverberate, cavitate all kinds of crazy things. One of them phase grenades goes off and 'POW' things get hazy for a moment or two. Yo\u2019 mind is dancing, for want of a better word, between the past and the present because of the effects of that grenade that just went off. So you got to ask yourself something? Something important I once taught ya.\u201d It\u2019s a hot Sunday in Georgia when Sergeant Collins tells him this.\n\u201cBut that\u2019s the past,\u201d Dexter Keith struggles to remind himself.\n\u201cA phase grenade messes with you grunt, with your memory. But you just remember everything I tell you, you associate concepts in times of crisis and stress and I\u2019ll be there for you and you'll live.\u201d Private Keith bangs on the side of his combat helmet and tries to focus on the present situation. What\u2019s happening on Nomad 247?\n\u201cJohnson, what the hell are you doing?\u201d yells Sergeant Collins back in Georgia on that hot morning of turkey and tar.\nZip Rifle bursts sizzle and crack across nearspace as Nomad 246 tumbles drunkenly through the star field above.\n\u201cI am on Nomad 247, that's where I\u2019m at now,\u201d confesses Private Keith to himself. He drops to the ice as micro-gravity begins to loosen its too loving, motherly grasp. A wave of phase-nausea sweeps over his cold sweating skin.\nMemories overrun his mind; his mother is holding him in her arms while they swim at the community pool on a hot Saturday in August. Swimming in the pool with his mother was the only place he would let her hold his rigid little-boy body. He was too strong-willed to let it happen in any other time or place. But in the pool, frightened of the water and the chaos of bigger children splashing, he clung to his mother as she held him closely.\n\u201cI am on Nomad 247,\u201d chants Dexter Keith to himself. \u201cAn asteroid in orbit around another asteroid identified as Nomad 246, experiencing brief periods of micro-gravity brought on by their close orbiting bodies.\u201d\n\u201cDamn straight again Keith,\u201d calls out Sergeant Collins. \u201cYou\u2019re some kind of brain? Now all you got to do is figure out why you are there?\u201d Another wave of phase-nausea, and Sergeant Collins turns away from him to direct verbal fire onto the nearby, perpetually slacking, Johnson. \u201cJohnson, get down and start knocking out push-ups till I get tired.\u201d In the red dirt of Georgia a year ago, Private Johnson drops to the ground and begins to execute the exercise, counting them out with forced enthusiasm.\nAnd back on Nomad 247, The Spiders, the mortal enemies of Private Dexter Keith and his squad, alien invaders come to destroy humanity, are advancing. In the background noise of Keith\u2019s helmet, the rest of the squad scream like children splashing in the waters of a long-forgotten collection of chlorine and water; cackling with calls of delight. His mother\u2014this asteroid\u2014pulls him closer, below the technological mayhem that is cutting both sides to shreds without prejudice. In the swimming pool of the universe, gravity also is love.\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re some kind of super genius Private Keith,\u201d begins Sergeant Collins. \u201cYour parents must of paid good money for them genes. Now the big question is what\u2019re you gonna do now that you got knocked senseless with that phase grenade and your mind is wobbling back and forth between Nomad 247 and the past. Seems like an important question, especially now that the enemy is advancing on your position. Might be time to fight back or something, don't you think?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d thinks Private Dexter, \u201cfight back, let them know who\u2019s boss.\u201d Gravity begins to let go ever so softly and Private Keith sticks his head up above a black outcrop of deep space-hardened ice. An edge of the squash-like shape that is Nomad 247, tracks in his Heads Up Display, graphing and calculating the lip and contours ahead. Beyond the lip begins the gentle fall towards the waist of the squash and the enemy.\n\u201cDamn Spiders must of thrown a grenade up here trying to dislodge our position. Looks like we're going to have to repel an assault,\u201d says Sergeant Collins.\n\u201cTrooper Keith, this is Doghouse, do you read me? Repeat ...\u201d The command net operator sounds distracted, bored, uninterested in the fate of Private Dexter Keith.\n\u201cRoger, roger, I read you crystal,\u201d replies Keith in transmission voice. The helmet\u2019s software recognizing the tone of his voice, broadcasts the reply on an authorized net.\n\u201cPrivate Keith, I show you as the only active friendly on Nomad two-four-seven, can you confirm?\u201d Again the tone bored, uninterested.\nFor a moment Keith lays his helmeted head down on the rock and ice. He closes his eyes and concentrates on breathing. He knows he\u2019s supposed to do this as gravity begins to disappear. But even the sound of his breath fades away as his stomach begins to float while he clings to the rocky surface of the pitching piece of nickel and ice that is Nomad 247. Johnson, Ferengetti, Reeves, Markowitz, gone. The entire scout platoon gone within moments of jumping onto Nomad 247. And Sergeant Collins? Gone.\n\u201cI'm not gone, knucklehead. I'm still here you stupid grunt,\u201d roared Sergeant Collins.\n\u201cNo you\u2019re dead too,\u201d whispers Keith to a vast universe with a gift for loneliness.\n\u201cListen up grunt, how about I crawl over to your position and show you how dead I am. You got to get back in the game soldier, your Airborne, we\u2019re Airborne, we don't just roll up and die when those Spiders toss a grenade at us. We're death from above and now it\u2019s time to start killing, grunt, or are you just some \u2018leg\u2019, waitin' for orders? If so, why don't you just dig in and make yourself comfortable.\u201d\n\u201cI ain't no leg,\u201d whispers Keith, gritting his teeth as he dismisses the worst insult an Airborne Trooper can be called; a leg: A regular infantrymen.\n\u201cGood, Private Keith, Airborne! Right now your the only one of us Command can talk to. You're also about to get overrun by Spiders. Here's what we\u2019re going to do. I'll flank to their right and try to get them to shift fire. I want you to lob some chaff grenades past the lip, those thing will mess with their commo for a moment or two, and then, when gravity resumes, I want you to assault their position. Roger?\u201d\n\u201cRoger,\u201d toned Private Keith blotting out thoughts of death on a tumbling ball of ice and nickel, alone and far from home.\n\u201cSay again Private Keith; your transmission seems to be coming in broken and distorted.\u201d It was Doghouse, the comm operator aboard The Lexington.\n\u201cCommand, I have a status update for our team,\u201d Private Keith reached back along his web gear, searching for the magnetic clip dispenser that would release two of his six chaff grenades. \u201cI have contact with Sergeant Collins. His communication and telemetry equipment seem to be malfunctioning but he assures me he\u2019s combat ready.\u201d\n\u201cBe advised, Private Keith, that we are tracking multiple Spiders converging on your AO; fire mission upon request.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t let them use those damn cannons,\u201d hisses Collins. \u201cThey\u2019ll kill you Keith. One of them heavy caliber depleted uranium rounds from the main guns will turn this whole rock to powder.\u201d\n\u201cNegative, negative, Doghouse, do not, repeat, do not fire on our position. We are engaging the enemy.\u201d\n\u201cDamn straight, now on my command pick your butt up and attack, and make sure to use them grenades first, Super-Brain. Just like training back in Georgia.\u201d\nPrivate Keith hurls the two chaff grenades forward into the rising lip of the Nomad 247 as the gentle hug of gravity returns. Forty five seconds worth of gravity before Zero G again, mumbles Keith to himself, information from the Operations Order that had survived the effects of the Phase-Grenade.\nThe chaff grenades seem to hang for a moment as he retinally cues his HUD to track them. Then with a deft flick of his eye reticule, he directs the grenades downward beyond the rapidly ascending ledge of the asteroid. A second later they disappear over the lip of his temporary horizon and a second after that, the silent crumple of aluminum foil can be heard in his ears as the comm channel picks up traces of their explosion.\nHe leaps up and leans forward, running towards the tumbling lip. Above him Nomad 246 falls towards the horizon, its scarred face in even more violent revolutions than that of Nomad 247.\nBounding over the lip he encounters two Spiders picking their way forward; one cautiously holding a heavy zip gun between its two forearms while the other carries a pistol and another phase grenade. The one with the heavy weapon had probably been watching the lip as they made their approached, but the suddenness of Keith bounding over the ledge has taken it completely by surprise. Keith's HUD highlights the chaff grenades\u2019 explosion radius farther down the slope.\nFor a brief moment the two Spiders and Private Keith do nothing while Nomad 246 sinks queasily below the horizon of midnight ice. Then the spider with the pistol begins to fire, rearing up on its back legs. The first shot goes wild, sizzling off into the void and the next will surely tear a gaping hole in Keith\u2019s Battle Gear and body.\nBut even as the Spider aimed for its next shot, depleted uranium rounds spat forth from Keith\u2019s auto rifle in a brutal sewing machine of bright fury, ripping the two spiders to shreds, flinging their various parts along with torn suit fragments out into the void at the edge of the solar system.\nSeconds later, gravity has disappeared as Keith grapples with disintegrating ice and crumbling rock. He is clutching frantically at the brittle surface of the pitching asteroid. In front of him, at the far end of the rising landscape, a full cohort of Spiders, ignoring the loss of planetary embrace, is scrambling forward, their four major limbs grappling with rock and ice effortlessly.\n\u201cDamn Spiders everywhere,\u201d shouts Sergeant Collins.\n\u201cDamn Spiders everywhere,\u201d thinks Keith. And now the Phase nausea rushes at him again, intense like a swarm of softly buzzing bees. Turkey and grease in the air, Johnson doing push-ups at the pool\u2019s edge on the hottest day of summer at the city pool in Oakland, California. Thoughts from back in the heart of the solar system, far beyond the edge where The Lexington holds her ground engaging three Spider Hulks that twist and roll crazily above the spinning microcosm that is the life and death struggle on Nomad 247.\nTime bends like a reed and snaps as the single-mindedness of warfare commences. Was there a time before this? Will there be an \u2018after\u2019? The scout platoon, just like the Spider cohort, had deployed onto Nomad 247 only forty five minutes earlier, sent in to secure the spinning piece of rock and ice for the tactical advantage it might prove itself to be.\nIf gravity is love in the swimming pool of the universe, then what is time? A tender mercy of things past, or the relentless melancholy of unending hell.\nSergeant Collins screamed, exhorted, cursed, and urged Keith on, who fought the Spiders, first using up all his depleted uranium ammo, then his remaining grenades and finally deploying the spring-loaded, industrial, diamond bayonet in the bottom of his rifle. He slashed and hacked at the physically weaker Spiders, removing limbs and antennae, gouging out endless eyes and feeling the rifle find purchase in the pulp beneath the mesh of their fibershell environment suits.\nChaos.\nAnger.\nRed Murder.\nNomad 246 said \u201chello\u201d and \u201chello\u201d again like some jolly, ageless uncle as it galloped above the battlefield. The Spider Hulks erupted in blue fire as their once impenetrable point defense networks collapsed beneath the onslaught of The Lexington\u2019s Main Guns and Multiple Launch System Turrets. Beyond that, the stars swam like children in a pool, laughing and beckoning on a hot summer day that promised to never end. \u201cDamn straight,\u201d said Sergeant Collins to the universe, and then he too was gone.\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re experiencing,\u201d said the Psych Officer during his last session at the VA, \u201cis association fatigue.\u201d Private Dexter Keith, now an UberMarket Manager, focuses on those words as wave after wave of housewives, trailing screaming children, wave their PDA\u2019s in coupon mode at the harried checkers.\nThe store telemetry system has fritzed out due to solar activity and now the Transactors aren\u2019t recognizing the PDA\u2019s coupon signals. Beautiful women, bronzed and reinforced with all the offerings of the latest in cosmetic efficiency, snort and cackle as Dexter Keith works on the Telecomm box, sweat streaming down in rivulets across his jowly face. He has gained more than a little weight since leaving the Expeditionary Corps. Lately he hears Sergeant Collins cajoling and cursing at him in crisis situations, which now seem to be the norm for the newly promoted manager of UberMart, New Las Vegas. At first it bothered him.\nHe never wanted to be reminded of the horror of Nomad 247. He didn\u2019t want to hear the screaming of that day anymore. The cries and other pulpier sounds of both friend and foe had plagued him for the first six months back on Earth. As always there was Sergeant Collins reminding him to hang tough, to gut it out, and in time, someday, he Dexter Keith would get better. But ten years later he was beginning to hear the voice of Sergeant Collins more and more often.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a minor side effect,\u201d the kind young Psych officer had assured him at the Veterans\u2019 Hospital, \u201cof your training.\u201d The way the Psych officer used the word \u2018training\u2019, made it seem as though his long lost instruction in basic infantry training had consisted of fighting with sticks and heavy rocks. \u201cBut nowadays it\u2019s better. The \u2018Sergeant Collins\u2019 program has been removed from service. The tendency for soldiers to hold onto Sergeant Collins caused some unexpected adjustment problems once they were returned from active duty.\u201d Sorrowful warmth painted the smile he offered Dexter. \u201cHe saved my life,\u201d mumbled Dexter in reply.\n\u201cIf it helps, there never was a Sergeant Collins. He was just a program written at WonderSoft to teach trainees, like yourself, how to fight and survive in space.\n\u201cFrom the day you first entered basic training you were inundated with all kinds of subconscious programming to respond to him. His African American straight talk and Mississippi mud accent were all contrived to make him both familiar and terrifying. When you sim\u2019d in Virtual he was always there, punishing you when you did wrong and rewarding you when you accomplished a task.\n\u201cIt was thought, that if soldiers were ever isolated on the battlefield, overwhelmed as it were, the Sergeant Collins program would kick in and give the soldier the illusion of help, a form of \u2018security\u2019 as it were.\n\u201cI know events that day were horrible and that you feel \u2018bad\u2019, but there are things to feel \u2018good\u2019 about. Those days were a fight for our lives. I mean, I was still in elementary school, but I remember the war. It was a fight for the very existence of the human race. We were that close to going over the hill and into history. But what you did that day, along with then entire crew of The Lexington and the whole effort of the human race turned the tide. That\u2019s something to be proud of. You did that, not Sergeant Collins.\n\u201cSo just remember, when Sergeant Collins starts talking, It\u2019s just Association Cavitation produced in a time of crisis or stress\u2014a harmless medical condition, the result of programming that we didn\u2019t have the time to test back in the early days of the war. It\u2019s just a minor side effect. Ignore it and in time it will go away.\u201d\nNow, back at the store, petulant housewives are starting to mock him. He sees what they see, and in a way he agrees with them. A fat man scrambling to meet their insatiable needs on one of the hottest days of the year with everything he does going wrong, exploding in his face like gags in a silent film. It\u2019s almost laughable. It could be something from the early days of cinema if it just weren\u2019t happening to him. It\u2019s a comedy of errors and sadly, it\u2019s his life.\n\u201cNow stop that talk, Private Brain. You're going break my heart with all your belly aching. Put it in gear son and get it done. Time's a wasting,\u201d barks Sergeant Collins from across the folds of Dexter Keith\u2019s combat-fried brain and antique faulty programming.\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d says one platinum-blond, BlueChem-eyed housewife over her monstrous breasts. \u201cIs there someone else in charge? Someone who knows what they\u2019re doing? I really have a lot of very important things to do besides sit here and watch you fumble with what seems to be a very simple procedure.\u201d\n\u201cTell her to eat depleted Uranium and die, Private Keith,\u201d hisses Sergeant Collins.\nNo can do, Sergeant. Customer service is critical at UberMart, whispers Keith.\n\u201cDamn me, Private Keith, I never thought I\u2019d see the day when one of my grunts ended up like this. Running an UberMart. I bet you think you're something and all.\u201d\nNo Sergeant. Not at all.\n\u201cWell Keith, we\u2019ll see what we\u2019ll see, but first you\u2019d better extricate yourself from this mess you seem to be in. What are going to do?\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d says Monster Breasts. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name and employee ID number? My husband grav golf's with the regional head of this crappy little store and ...\u201d\n\u201cSmack her around, Keith.\u201d\nNo can do Sarge.\n\u201cAlright then. Ignore her. She\u2019s harmless. The most important thing right now is that you work the problem. Not the equipment. You know what I mean, young trooper. Just like a rifle malfunction. The equipment works, it\u2019s just that there\u2019s a problem somewhere in the system and once you fix that problem the equipment will work. Roger?\u201d\nRoger, Sergeant.\nKeith finds the problem and seconds later the Transactors go online. Housewives clap for themselves and say things like \u201cHonestly,\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s about time!\u201d Keith smiles his fat man\u2019s smile and mops the sweat from his forehead. Delora, the head checker, smiles sadly at him. An honest smile, a good smile. A smile he thinks about late at night when he sits on his back porch in the cool breeze of the Martian dark and thinks about not being alone so much.\nLater, on the loading dock out back, Dexter Keith smokes a cigarette and leans against the red sandstone wall.\n\u201cIt\u2019s days like today ...\u201d he thinks, but doesn\u2019t finish.\n\u201cIt\u2019s days like today,\u201d whispers Sergeant Collins out of the silence, \u201cthat make me proud to have trained such a fine troop as yourself. You\u2019ve done good, son, you\u2019ve just been too hard on yourself lately. Just don\u2019t let it mess with your head.\u201d\nI won\u2019t, Sergeant Collins.\n\u201cDamn straight. I won\u2019t let you and I won\u2019t let them. Now what about that pretty young thing up front, what\u2019s her name?\u201d\nDelora, Sergeant Collins.\n\u201cAh, Delora. Sounds nice when you say it like that. I think yer in love, Private Keith.\u201d\nMaybe, Sergeant Collins.\n\u201cWell tomorrow we gonna start training. Oh-dark-hundred we\u2019re going to run, Private Keith. We\u2019re going get back into fighting shape and show Delora what an airborne trooper looks like. And what are you doing smoking, Private Keith? Crush that thing out and start knocking out some push-ups.\u201d\nPush-ups, Sergeant Collins?\n\"Did I stutter Private Keith? Count off so I can hear you.\u201d Dexter Keith lowers himself to the hot grit of the Martian stone and for the first time in a long time, begins to exercise. It feels good.\nIf gravity is love in the swimming pool of the universe and time a tender mercy or an unrelenting hell, then what is Sergeant Collins?\nOne, two, three, one, one, two, three, two ... Sergeant Collins?\n\u201cYeah, Keith?\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\nMaybe a voice in the dark.

Riso\nIn the end, reality is as clich\u00e9 as Hollywood. When little green men fly over in their souped-up Frisbees, I can\u2019t muster up any surprise. All I can do is wonder if they ever go cruising for chicks in those things on a Saturday night. I lower my gaze from the sky and walk into the house.\n\u201cIt serves all of us right, I guess,\u201d I say. My giggles echo off the empty walls. I can\u2019t bring myself to regret that I have no one to say goodbye to. \u201cBut I have never been lonely,\u201d I say out loud.\nThe air in front of me ripples; a man-shaped shadow materializes. \u201cYou have never been alone,\u201d he whispers. I can\u2019t discern his features, but I feel the resonance of his smile.\nI sit for a long while, my hand in his, and listen to the pandemonium. Frantic shadows scurry by the windows. I am entitled to join them now; indiscriminate tragedy is always a good icebreaker. They are going to congregate in designated shelters. Safety in numbers, and all that nonsense. The masses have never made me feel safe.\n\u201cThe sad fools,\u201d I say with a sigh. Their panicked stampede is as predictable as a Bruce Willis blockbuster. It will be a bitter betrayal when he doesn\u2019t show up to save them.\nAfter nightfall we wander the vacant streets. We watch the horizon, as the radiance from distant cities is extinguished one by one. My insignificance, something I\u2019ve forever detested, isn\u2019t such a bad thing after all. They will come for us loners last. The meek have inherited precious last moments.\nThe Shadow Man takes my hand and leads me uptown, to the mansions. Jubilation wells up in me like effervescent pearls. No place is forbidden now. The imposing iron gates are thrown open like welcoming arms.\nA warm glow appears amid the blackness; rays of light rain down from an upstairs window.\nI whisper, \u201cHow can a light still burn? There has been no electricity for hours.\u201d I am more intrigued than afraid.\nWe enter the house. It is completely still, except for a diffuse luminosity. Golden light streams from a bedroom. I take a tentative step inside. A little girl emerges from behind a large dollhouse. A shimmer within her opalescent flesh. She is the source of the light.\n\u201cWe just want to look, honey,\u201d I say.\nShe nods and leads us through the labyrinthine hallways. The Shadow Man disappears down a dark alley. The corridor opens into a cavernous bedroom. I gasp at its opulence. A chandelier shines rainbow prisms in my eyes. My head swoons with the rich scent of fresh roses.\n\u201cThey have left me behind,\u201d the Light Girl says; her voice is metallic indifference. \u201cWill you take me with you?\u201d\n\u201cWe are going up to the mountains. It will be cold, dark, and dangerous. Why would you leave all of this?\u201d\nI look around at all of the feminine, superfluous things. The shoes of every style and color, the perfume and jewelry-littered dresser, the flamboyant evening gowns that were worn only once. Superficial, tactile things. The things I will miss. I finally understand that worn-out platitude -- you can\u2019t take it with you.\n\u201cStay here with me,\u201d says the Light Girl. She puts her small, warm hand in mine. \u201cWe can play dress up.\u201d\nI reach out and stroke a green silk gown. Such luxury has never touched my work-battered hands. They are going to come for me, eventually. I will not prolong the futile charade of survival in some dank cave.\nThe Shadow Man pokes his head in the closet. He\u2019s wearing a black tuxedo two sizes too large. \u201cI have something for you.\u201d He holds out a corsage of pink orchids. \u201cGet dressed, my darling, and let\u2019s dance.\u201d\nThe Light Girl giggles and claps her hands.\nWhen they come for us, we will look smashing.\nJ.

When she finally got a call, it interrupted one of her better dreams.\nShe glanced at the clock. Three AM.\nSlipping into her robe, she closed the window against the cool breeze that fluttered at the curtains. The smell of damp air lingered. She stepped to her console and authorized call reception.\nRob Burns, her graduate intern, appeared in the monitor.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\n\u201cWe have a candidate.\"\nShe took a breath to absorb his words.\n\u201cHe\u2019s ...\u201d She started to ask if he was dead, but decided she didn\u2019t want to go there. \u201cHe\u2019s intact?\u201d\n\u201cThe right frontal cortex is badly damaged, and extensive general trauma resulted in brain death. But large tracts of cells are still alive. He's on life support.\u201d\n\u201cBut there\u2019s no brain activity?\u201d\n\u201cNo. He\u2019s dead. Our request had priority.\u201d\n\u201cIs the family OK with this?\u201d Sari chewed the inside of her cheek. Despite her frustrations with Sam, she, too, worried about the ethics of it all.\nRob's eyes dropped. \u201cActually, there isn\u2019t any family, at least that we can find. He has a wife, but they're separated.\u201d\nSari\u2019s heart sank. They couldn\u2019t proceed without permission of the family.\n\u201cWe have to find his wife.\u201d\nRob didn\u2019t look up. \u201cIf he has no family, we thought ... well ... that he would be a good test subject.\u201d He shifted uncomfortably. \u201cIf we succeed, all to the good. If we fail, no one has to be disappointed.\u201d\n\u201cWe thought\u201d must mean Jan was at the hospital with Rob. Sari nodded.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be there in twenty minutes,\u201d she said. \u201cHave him ready.\u201d\n\u201cShould I ...\u201d Rob hesitated. \u201cDo you want me to call Sam?\"\nSam. She could do without Sam.\n\u201cOf course. He has to know.\u201d She couldn't quite keep the tension from her voice.\nFailing to face Sam now would only make facing him later worse. And, if things didn't go well, then, as head of Bioneurology and as the only other division head with any meaningful understanding of her project, he might provide some shelter from the political fallout.\nShe took the Advector to the hospital. It was quicker than a private vehicle, and she didn\u2019t have to worry about where to park. Plus, she liked the sound of wind whistling around the system\u2019s magnetically driven capsules.\nShe sat down on the single padded seat, and the capsule accelerated away. She could hear Sam's challenge in her mind.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t play God with human life,\u201d he would say.\nIf she heard it once more, she was sure she\u2019d barf.\nWhy were religious people always so opposed to scientific progress?\nIn this case, what was there to fear? If something saved lives, it was good. If it cost lives, it was bad. It wasn\u2019t that hard to figure out. Her project couldn\u2019t cost a life. There was only upside potential with no down side risk.\nIf she failed, well, a dead guy was still dead. But, if she\nsucceeded ...\nShe watched the streetlights flash past the capsule window like strobes. Her thoughts went to the romantic dream that the call interrupted. Yummy guy. Handsome despite the baseball cap. Why couldn't she meet someone like that in real life? The warm glow of the dream had faded.\nShe often joked at the lab that her name scared away most of the men. Sarina. Like the deadly nerve toxin.\nWhen she wasn't joking, she suspected her name wasn't the problem.\nSam was in the waiting room when she arrived. He couldn\u2019t have dallied after Rob\u2019s call. At least he took the project seriously.\nHe was dressed informally. She noticed a baseball cap, canted slightly askew, sitting on his head. It looked remarkably like the cap in her dream. She grimaced. Fortunately, the similarity ended with the hat. His slightly pudgy frame and graying hair didn't resemble her dream man.\nHe spotted her across the lobby, and his face lit with a big smile. He hurried to meet her half way.\n\u201cCongratulations!\u201d He seemed genuinely pleased for her, but she wondered if he had some agenda. He started to give her a hug, but she stepped back, and he ended with an awkward pat on her shoulder. Amazing that, in this modern day, he didn\u2019t realize the inappropriateness of open affection between colleagues.\nHe stepped back to look at her, and his face grew sober.\n\u201cSari, are you sure you want to do this? There's so much we don\u2019t know yet.\u201d\nShe winced. At least he didn\u2019t talk about playing God with life.\n\u201cSam, we\u2019ve been over this a dozen times. What, realistically, can go wrong?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d\u2014finally, something they agreed on\u2014 \u201ca million things. We just can\u2019t play God with human life.\u201d\nSari thought about barfing, and it struck her as so funny that she laughed out loud. Sam looked at her strangely, and she stopped.\nSam continued, \u201cFor example, what if your computer brain revives your patient, but his own brain never heals? Will he be alive? Will he be human? Will he have a soul? Can we turn off the computer if the project fails, or would that be murder? There are so many questions ...\u201d\nThat wasn\u2019t going to happen, and if it did, so what? Technology was now part of the evolution of life. Sari decided to turn some of Sam\u2019s own reasoning against him.\n\u201cIf God made the universe, and what we call natural law is simply a manifestation of His consistent character, then it's impossible for any part of the universe to be anything other than His creation. There are no abominations, except those we impose on each other by our lack of caring, or by our failure to pursue what's new and good.\u201d\nSam nodded, whether because he agreed or simply to acknowledge that he heard, she didn\u2019t know.\n\"Sari, I'm behind your project, you know that. Just be careful.\"\nShe snorted. \"Careful with the project, or careful with your religious feelings?\"\nSam smiled faintly. \"I know you've had some bad experience with religious folks. But, not everyone who's concerned with moral choice is anti-science. After all, I've given my life to science.\"\n\u201cAre you going to do the surgery?\u201d She hated to admit he was a better neurosurgeon than she, but the success of her project trumped her pride.\n\u201cYou know I will, Sari,\u201d he answered. \u201cI agree that we have to try this ... eventually. I just think we should proceed more slowly.\u201d\n\u201cWe have permission and a body, right now,\u201d said Sari, somewhat coldly. \u201cNow is our opportunity.\u201d\n\u201cIf you want to do it now, I\u2019ll do it now,\u201d Sam said. \u201cI just don\u2019t want you getting hurt if something goes wrong.\u201d\nThat sounded goofy. Sari ignored it, glad to accept his willingness to proceed.\nSari waited at the hospital. She didn't have much to do, unless there was a problem with the Theracom or a question about how to connect it. But the project was hers, and she couldn't bring herself to leave.\nSam's word's bothered her, but she didn't want to dwell on possible problems. The Theracom wouldn't fail.\nIt had always struck her as odd that the brain, so plastic and adaptable, could heal from an injury under modern medication, rewiring neural connections and retraining neurons to new tasks, up to the point where that injury exceeded some mysterious threshold. Then, a person became a vegetable, and there was no healing even if entire flotillas of healthy brain cells remained.\nWhy?\nShe thought she knew the answer.\nThe brain could heal itself so long as its internal workings connected one cell to another and guided the healing. Once an injury decreased intercellular communication below some critical level, the brain didn\u2019t know how to heal, and it waited forever for guidance that never came.\nThe tiny artificial brain that she had developed could change that. Inserted into a vegetative brain, connected to the surviving neurons, providing intellect and forcing neurons to fire and work, the Theracom\u2014short for therapeutic computer\u2014would raise the human brain back above its death threshold so it could heal. Occupational therapy for the brain. Once the natural brain healed, the artificial brain could be shut down. The person would live again.\nAt the very least, her plan would either work or not. Certainly her patients would not become Frankensteinian monsters. Sam\u2019s concerns seemed short-sighted.\nAbout 10 o\u2019clock, Jan came in and told her that they had contacted the man\u2019s wife.\n\u201cIs she OK with this?\u201d Sari asked, nervous that she had decided to proceed without permission. A lawsuit would definitely tarnish the high praise she imagined would follow her accomplishment.\nJan pushed her Personal at Sari. \u201cHere's her response.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you find me?\" the woman wrote. \"Our divorce was final a week ago. I don\u2019t want him to know where I am. Jack is not a nice man. Please don't contact me again.\u201d\nSari stared at the message. So, she was bringing \u201cnot a nice man\u201d back to life. Too bad he couldn\u2019t have been, like, a scientist or great humanitarian. A Nobel laureate would have been good.\nSari frowned. \"I suppose Sam will point out that we could have waited for a better candidate.\"\nJan glanced away. \"Don't you think you're being a bit unfair?\"\nSari ignored her question. \"The opinion of a jaded ex-wife doesn't mean much anyway.\"\n\"Sam will understand that.\"\nSari handed the Personal back to Jan. \u201cIs there any other family?\u201d\nJan shook her head.\nSari felt disappointed. No one to appreciate her bringing their loved one back to life.\nThe operation lasted until just after noon. Sam\u2019s face when he emerged indicated success. He asked her if she wanted to go for lunch, but she wished to be alone and get some sleep.\nThey brought Jack to consciousness the next day. When his eyes fluttered open, Sari was the first person he saw.\n\u201cHello,\u201d she said, smiling encouragement.\n\u201cHello. Where am I? What happened?\u201d\n\u201cYou had an accident and were badly injured. We're trying a new kind of treatment for you.\u201d She decided not to tell him yet what that new treatment entailed.\nHe nodded abstractly. He seemed to have no emotional response to the news, as she had expected. The Theracom, to insure that it didn't impose an artificial personality, had no capacity for emotion except what it learned from the patient\u2019s own brain.\nSari scribbled a few notes on her Personal, writing the label \u201cJack-E\u201d on the record file to distinguish the original Jack from the electronically modified Jack.\nJack-E had a few more questions, pursuing factual information with little emotional attachment: \u201cWhat part of me was injured? How many days have passed? How long will recovery take?\u201d\nSari answered each truthfully, although she held back somewhat concerning the severity of his brain injury, choosing to focus on the less severe injuries to his leg and back.\nWhen Sari visited on the second day, Jack-E had more probing questions for her.\n\u201cTell me more about my injury, it\u2019s not an ordinary one is it?\"\nShe told him more.\nHe asked about his treatment. She continued to withhold the basic truth that, at present, he had a human-made computer running his thinking, fearing that he might react badly. She did, however, tell him that his treatment was a very new and exciting one for healing severe brain injury.\nHe nodded at her answers, seemingly content.\nOn the third day, as she rose from the chair at his bedside to leave, he took her hand and asked quietly, \u201cYou've done something special for me, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nSari nodded, smiling slightly.\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember ...\u201d, he paused. \u201c I don\u2019t remember anyone doing anything special for me before.\" He squeezed her hand. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nAfter she left his room, Sari wrote down the exchange in her Personal. His words, and the sentiments expressed, surprised her. It didn't surprise her that the Theracom could access memories, since many of those must reside in undamaged areas of the brain. It surprised her that Jack-E summoned forth so much emotion and personality so early in his recovery. Three days was too soon for meaningful neural rewiring or for new cell assignments and growth, even given the enhancements from medication. Certainly, the Theracom was not programmed to initiate such sentiment on its own. Whatever part of Jack-E\u2019s deeper mind survived must be awakening and interacting with the Theracom, teaching it about being human.\nThat was not completely expected. That the Theracom was adaptive was essential, but that her Device could learn about being human surprised her even though she had hoped for it.\nWith the project taking precedence over her other responsibilities, Sari found herself spending more and more time with Jack-E, talking or just sitting with him through the day. He seemed to enjoy her company, and never tired of long conversations on a variety of topics. She found him to be a remarkable man, smart and kind and so interested in the world of ideas. Soon, she shared with him all her thinking and plans for the Theracom, no longer keeping its nature secret. He didn't seem to be at all troubled by the idea that a significant part of his working brain was artificial. Of course, she assured him that soon they would be able to disable the computer, and he would be fully himself again.\nHe asked \"how soon\" many times, and each time she simply said \u201csoon.\u201d\nShe told him about her name, Sarina, like the nerve toxin. He laughed, and after that he called her \"Rina\" rather than \"Sari\". She liked the way it made her feel special.\nOne day when she came into the room, the nurse was just finishing taking Jack-E\u2019s pulse. A few minutes later, without thinking, she took his pulse again. She realized that she liked the feel of his hand in hers. She wondered if she were falling in love.\nThe thought rattled her so much that she left early.\nSam was in the lobby, and he waved her to a couch on a secluded side of the room. She really didn\u2019t want to chat right now, but acquiesced. Hopefully he wouldn\u2019t talk about his former wife. She had left him over two years ago, and he didn\u2019t seem to be over it. Why he chose to confide in her, Sari couldn\u2019t imagine.\nHe didn\u2019t talk about his wife. He talked about Jack-E.\n\u201cSari, you want to be careful about getting too close to a patient. There are legal concerns as well as emotional ones.\u201d\nSari managed to contain her temper until she was alone with Jan back at the lab.\n\u201cHow dare he!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cWho I share my time with is none of his business.\u201d\nJan didn\u2019t answer for a moment.\n\u201cHave you considered the possibility that he might be jealous?\u201d\nSari fell silent. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d she said, and dropped the conversation.\nThe day came when Jack-E was nearly well and would have long since left the hospital were it not for the unusual nature of his surgery. Sari often walked with him in the gardens across the street from the hospital. On their third outing, they sat on a bench beside an ancient oak tree.\n\u201cWhat makes us who we are, Rina?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She felt the warmth of his body pressed against hers and pressed back gently.\n\u201cOur soul has to be more than a physical presence, more than electrical impulses. How do body and energy interact in such a way as to create a mind, an awareness, that's more than the sum of both?\u201d\nThe sun warmed her back, but the air was cool. She tightened her jacket against the breeze that rustled the last of the autumn leaves. \u201cWhat makes you ask such things?\u201d\n\u201cI feel like this body belongs to someone else, the person you set out to save. I'm neither a human brain nor your new technology. I'm like a sundog\u2014not sunlight or cloud but a mysterious pattern of color created by the brief interaction between those two, different from what either could be alone.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk that way,\u201d Sari complained, squeezing his hand. \u201cSoon, we can turn off the Theracom, and you'll be healed. Then you won\u2019t have these troubled thoughts.\u201d\n\u201cAre my thoughts troubled?\u201d Jack-E caught her eyes into his. \u201cOr is it reasonable to wonder who I am?\u201d\n\"You're who you've always been.\"\nHe leaned over to pick up an acorn at his feet and pressed it into her hand. Sari frowned, confused.\n\"If anything should happen, maybe you can plant a tree and remember me.\" He rose and walked back toward the hospital.\nShe slipped the acorn into her pocket and hurried to catch up.\nJack-E's conversation worried Sari, and that evening she called Sam. When his face appeared on the monitor, much of her angst melted away. She told him what Jack-E had said.\n\u201cHe probably wonders what will happen when you turn off the Theracom,\u201d Sam told her. \u201cHaven't you wondered that, too?\u201d\n\u201cBut he's a real person, right?\u201d She chided herself for doubting even as she asked. Hadn\u2019t she and Sam discussed this many times already, long before they began the test with Jack-E? Hadn\u2019t she always been the one persuading Sam?\n\u201cOf course he's a real person, Sari. Of course he is. But the question he's asking you is this; is he the person you set out to save?\"\nSari bit at her lip. \u201cI haven\u2019t done something wrong, have I?\u201d\n\u201cYou are doing the very best that you can.\u201d\nSari appreciated Sam\u2019s support. It felt good to talk to him, to hear him tell her things she wished to hear. But she had no answer to Sam\u2019s, or Jack-E\u2019s, questions.\nOn the day she told Jack-E the good news, Sari took him out for a celebration dinner. After ordering baked cod, and he a steak, medium-well, Sari announced her decision.\n\u201cTomorrow we begin turning off the Theracom.\u201d\nShe expected him to be as excited as she was. Success was so near.\nInstead, he looked away and shivered.\nHe recovered quickly. \u201cWhatever happens, I\u2019m glad for this time you gave me. I\u2019m glad I got to know you.\u201d\n\u201cYour brain is healed,\u201d she said, tapping her water glass with a fingernail. \u201cNothing bad will happen. If it does, we can turn the Theracom back on for a while longer.\u201d\nJack-E didn\u2019t answer for a moment. His eyes fell to the plate of food newly brought by the waiter.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that this body will be fine,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the brain that's in it will be fine. But, what about me? Will I be fine?\u201d\nSari shook her head in frustration. \u201cJack-E, nothing in the Theracom imposed a will or personality. The Theracom is information, analysis, extra dynamics to bring you to consciousness. Any personality is your own.\u201d\n\u201cBut, it had to interact with my brain,\u201d Jack-E pointed out. \u201cFire neurons, send messages, call forth memories or ideas. Otherwise, it couldn't have brought me awake. Even now, it must be interacting with my brain, perhaps in different ways than my brain would interact on its own.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but it doesn\u2019t change who you are.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d\nSari had no answer.\nAfter a moment, Jack-E continued. \u201cI remember doing things I wouldn't do now. I don\u2019t want to be that person again.\u201d\nSari frowned slightly and reached across the table to place her hand over his. \u201cThe Theracom is only a machine, not who you are.\u201d\nJack-E brought his other hand over hers, so hers now rested between his. \u201cWhatever comes tomorrow, I have valued today. I would like to know if ...\" he paused a moment before continuing, \"Rina, do you think you might ever want to marry me?\u201d\nShe gazed at him, stunned by the proposal from this man she didn\u2019t know a few months ago, this man she had spent nearly every waking moment with since, this man she had come to love.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, I might.\u201d\nJack-E appeared to be on the verge of saying something more, but he released her hand and, taking up his knife, began to dissect his steak.\nSari returned to the lab. She couldn\u2019t wait to tell everyone about her and Jack-E. She expected her colleagues to be surprised. They thought she was too strong to marry, too independent. She had cultivated that belief of course. That probably hadn\u2019t helped her prospects much, sending the message to everyone who knew her that she wasn\u2019t interested in a relationship. But it had always felt safer than hoping for something that might never materialize. Then they would have pitied her, and that would be worse than loneliness. Worse, she would have pitied herself.\nShe found Rob and Sam working late at the lab and told them her happy news. She saw Sam start in surprise--he probably couldn\u2019t imagine anyone finding her appealing. His smile looked a bit forced, but his words sounded sincere enough.\n\u201cI\u2019m really glad for you, Sari. Congratulations.\u201d\nRob seemed less enthused. \"Are you sure about this? We don't know what will happen when we turn off the Theracom.\"\nSari frowned. \"Nothing will happen. He's well now.\"\nThe next day, Sari began turning off the Theracom. It was designed to be shut down in stages, allowing assurances to be made that the brain was fully healed.\n\"So, lady, when do I get out of this dump?\" Jack asked as she prepared to leave for supper.\nSari jumped at his tone. \"Two more days and the Theracom will be inert. We have a few days of testing after that.\"\nHe nodded. \"Good to be out of this place. Get back to work.\"\nShe crossed the room to retrieve her Personal from the window sill. She felt his eyes following her in ways that made her uncomfortable. When she faced him, he turned away.\nShe watched him for a moment, but he didn't meet her eyes.\n\"I'll see you tomorrow,\" she said.\n\"Sure, whatever.\"\nHe called out to her when she reached the door. \"Don't forget to plant some acorns, Rina.\"\nShe turned back with a big smile, but his attention had drifted to the outside window. She left without answering.\nHe didn't talk much on the second day.\n\"Are you still interested in marrying me?\" she asked toward evening, suppressing a tremble in her voice.\nHe turned away. \"I don't think so, darlin'. I doubt you'd much like me now.\"\nHer eyes stung, and she busied herself taking notes on her Personal. She had known it could be like this. She just hadn't admitted it to herself. She was good at that. Denial. Keeping distant. Maybe that's why she accepted his proposal. She knew it couldn't go anywhere.\nStill, Jack-E must be in there somewhere, warning her away from this other Jack.\nBy the third day, the Theracom was completely shut down. When Jack asked her for a drink of water, and she was busy writing notes in her Personal and said \u201cJust a minute\u201d, he became suddenly angry, seizing her wrist so tightly it hurt.\n\u201cYou're hurting me,\u201d she said.\n\u201cLook lady, I said I need water, and I need it.\u201d\nHe smiled, but it wasn't a nice smile. Not the smile that she knew.\n\u201cI know what I need better than you,\u201d he finished, his sudden anger fading.\nShe began spending less and less time with him. By the end of the week she did what she had to\u2014overseeing the tests needed to reconstruct what happened to Jack-E\u2014and quickly left. He didn\u2019t seem to care whether she stayed or not.\nSari thought about reviving the Theracom, bringing back the personality of Jack-E. The one whom she loved. But how could she justify that? Every indication was that this was, indeed, the Jack who had died. He had truly healed, healed too perfectly into the person he had once been.\nSari needed a confidante with whom to talk over her sense of guilt and loss. She called Sam. They arranged to meet for supper at a little caf\u00e9 near the lab.\nHe was waiting for her when she arrived, a booth already reserved. He stood up as she approached.\nHe gave her a hug, and she hugged him back, crying for a minute on his shoulder. Somehow, it didn't matter that such intimacy between colleagues was inappropriate. Sam was, she realized, her best friend in the world.\nSari wiped her eyes and sat down, at first gazing blankly at a silly picture on the wall beside the booth, cats driving an old classic Suburban. She looked at Sam, watching her, patiently waiting.\n\"I anticipated that the electronic brain could join with the organic one, strengthen it, give it space to heal,\" she said a last. \"I even thought, maybe secretly, that the organic mind might teach the electronic one how to think and feel like a human. What I didn't anticipate was that together they might form a different person, another soul, different from what either part could be alone.\"\nThere was a catch in her voice, and she stopped.\n\"It\u2019s always what we don't know to think about that gets us,\" Sam said quietly. \"But you've learned things that will save lives, and, perhaps, change life for the better in ways that we can't imagine now or even bring ourselves to consider.\"\n\"You would have waited, been more careful.\"\n\"I would have waited,\" Sam agreed. \"But sometimes, there are things we can't learn, however long we wait, until we step into the unknown.\"\n\"He knew what would happen, I think.\"\n\"Then why not stop us?\" Sam asked.\n\"That would have cost a different life.\"\n\"We did what we set out to do, Sari.\" Sam paused to thank the waitress as she gave them each a cup of hot tea. \"We saved a life, brought him back from the dead.\"\n\"To do that, I made a new person, and then let him die.\" Sari wrapped her fingers desperately around the warm comfort of the ceramic cup. \"And now I am left to wonder, am I healer, creator, or murderer?\"\n\"There are moral questions that we have yet to answer.\" A faint smile softened his face. It wasn't a smug I-told-you-so smile which he could have easily justified, but an I-understand-and-we're-in-it-together smile. It made her feel less alone.\n\"If there's no body, can we truly say that anyone died?\" Sam continued. \"And if someone did die at your hand, someone who would otherwise not have lived at all, is it truly a reason to weep?\"\n\"It is reason to weep.\" Sari stared at the cup in her hands as though it were a time machine that might take them back to try again. \"It's reason indeed.\"\nSari's message light was blinking when she got home. She ran to the console to read it, not pausing to take off her coat or shoes. \"From Jack-E\" it said.\n\"Rina,\nI send this letter with a delay so that, in case I am wrong, I might intercept it. But I'm not wrong. I'll be gone when you read this. Please don\u2019t blame yourself. I knew what would happen once you shut off the Theracom. I agreed with your choice.

Blond, southern-accented Bobby Lee Jackson grinned hugely, chomping on his trademark enormous cigar. Across from him, black-haired Kurt \"Snake\" Disney gave a broad wink with the eye not covered by a black eye patch.\n\"We're gonna clean these guys up, easy,\" said Snake.\n\"All we need to know is where they are,\" said Bobby.\n\"Don't be overconfident,\" said Mark. \"This is no game. The lives of 20 trillion Americans depend on what we do here tonight.\"\nThe three of them occupied a triangle of seats in the control room of an old SSTT-9900 space shuttle. The SSTT-9900 was only used for commercial flights; it mounted no weapons. With luck, the terrorists who had taken over the L-4 space colony wouldn't be expecting a team of Alpha Force Special Ops Special Operators.\nEach member of the team had been hand-picked by training specialists of the United Earth Freedom Force Defense League (UEFFDL). They each had a body worthy of Arnold Schwarzenegger and the good looks of Tom Hanks, Brad Pitt, or, depending upon contractual availability, Tom Cruise. Their ages ranged from 28 to 33. Each was a qualified master sharpshooter, an expert in kung fu, aikido, judo, karate, savate, and kickboxing. They had the fastest reflexes of anyone living, could detect the sound of a pin dropping in the middle of a firefight, and all three had perfect stereoscopic vision, an extraordinarily hard talent to develop for Snake, who only had one eye. Their training, the hardest and toughest training in the Solar system, had made them impervious to pain, extremes of heat and cold, and hard radiation. And in addition, each was possessed of freakishly huge genitals.\nThe terrorists were led by the notorious Abdul Muhammad Garcia, head of the feared Al Querida Qaeda.\n\"And it's all because of The Sphere,\" said Mark.\n\"Yeah, The Sphere,\" said Bobby Lee.\n\"Sphere,\" repeated Snake.\nColonizing the terraformed Mars, Venus, Ganymede, Callisto and Titan hadn't provided enough room for the burgeoning population of Earth. With great reluctance, the inhabitants of the Solar system had been forced to detonate the giant planets, Jupiter through Neptune, and use the mass of their inner, rocky cores to construct a gigantic sphere around the Sun. Humanity's teeming trillions occupied the inner surface of the great sphere, and their government occupied the Earth, which still existed as a planet but now rolled around just inside the equator of the gigantic, solid Dyson sphere known simply as The Sphere.\nTo construct the track which held the Earth, the material of Earth's moon had been sacrificed. But to the moon worshippers of Al Querida Qaeda, this was sacrilege of the highest order. The Moon was sacred! Its death had to be avenged!\nThey had started out with traditional terrorist methods, bombing public sites and sniping at police and paramedics when they arrived. For variety, they occasionally raped puppies on public access TV while chanting loudly to Satan. The whole of the Sphere had united against the evil group, and it had been thought that the last vestiges of them had been wiped out. It had been thought so, that is, until the old, abandoned space colony of L-4, previously orbiting harmlessly 238,000 miles from the inner surface of The Sphere, had suddenly changed course. The Sphere had then heard the voice of Abdul Muhammad Garcia on an illegal broadcast.\n\"Silly Americans,\" he said. Since the 31st century, all humans had been known as \"Americans,\" except for the rare few who were un-American. This shared ethos came from a common culture. Children under six were legally required to cry when Bambi's mother was shot and when the boy had to put down Old Yeller. Everyone ate at Starbucks and Mickey D's. As a result, all inhabitants of The Sphere considered themselves Americans.\n\"Silly Americans,\" repeated the terrorist. \"You thought to destroy the Holy Moon for your greedy capitalist scheme. Now you shall all pay, as I crash this old, abandoned space colony of L-4, previously orbiting harmlessly 238,000 miles from the inner surface of The Sphere, into Earth itself! The unspent fuel in the colony's gas tanks will create a fireball that will consume the entire Sphere. Thus will you perish for your crimes against the Holy Moon!\"\nBlonde and shapely Jane Jackson Jones, President of The Sphere, had pleaded with the crazed assassins. \"What good would it do you to destroy The Sphere? There will be no place left for you to rule if you destroy it all. Why eliminate trillions of innocent people who have never done you any harm? Eliminate me if you will ... fire a bullet into my heaving, white, naked bosom with its delicious rosy-tipped nipples ... but let my poor people live!\"\n\"No!\" said Abdul.\n\"Yes!\" she pleaded.\n\"No!\" he refused.\n\"Yes!\" she begged.\n\"No!\" he insisted.\n\"Yes!\" she remonstrated.\n\"No!\" he exploded.\nAt last the President had seen that all efforts to change the crazed mind of the terrorist leader were futile. In 24 hours, the L-4 space colony would crash into the Earth, the subsequent explosion destroying the entire Sphere. Jane knew then that she had to employ her secret weapon.\nShe had summoned Team Alpha to the Elliptical Office. Her hands clasped on her immense rosewood desk, she addressed the elite soldiers with solemn, serious solemnity. \"Boys,\" she said. \"You know the situation.\"\n\"Darn right,\" said Mark McMasters. \"I had a feeling you'd be calling us sooner or later to sort out this crazy mess.\"\n\"I'm afraid so. You've got to stop Abdul Muhammad Garcia. If you don't, the consequences will be terrible.\"\n\"Madam President, we'll give it our best shot.\"\n\"That's all I ask,\" she said. \"Wait, one more thing. We're all facing imminent, horrible death. We've got only hours to contact our loved ones and tell them all that they've meant to us, to put our affairs in order, to get right with Him, the Man Upstairs. It's a time for introspection, for reflection on how we've spent our lives. I've got to have you!!!\" And with that she had ripped off all her clothing and lain down on the massive rosewood desk, sending pens, notepads and high-tech devices spinning and crashing in all directions. Mark, as team leader, made tough love to her first, followed by Bobby Lee, who made love in his more gentlemanly southern manner, and then Snake, who got down and dirty. \"Go,\" she said. \"Go, and save Earth, and all of humanity.\"\n\"You got it,\" said Mark.\nThe shuttle approached the falling Space Station, coming close to the main docking port. At once the terrorists contacted them via sub-etheric sub-space sub-radio. \"Incoming ship, identify yourself at once or face flaming, fiery death!\"\n\"Um, it's just us,\" said Mark in a timorous, trembly voice, not at all like his usual deep basso profundo. One who didn't know of his incredibly masculine identity would have thought the speaker a timid, pathetic soul employed in the service industry. \"Um, you know. Maintenance. To make sure all the toilets are working correctly.\"\n\"Well, I suppose you can dock, then,\" said the terrorist comm officer. \"But if you try any treachery, your fate will be painful and deeply frightening!\"\n\"Okay,\" said Mark, with a broad wink at his companions.\nMark docked the shuttle, making perfect contact as usual. The three adventurers then checked their side-arms. These were the most advanced and masculine weapons ever developed by the United Earth Freedom Force Defense League (UEFFDL). Almost two feet in length, with a 90-calibre aperture, the guns contained powerful superconducting batteries which built up a tremendously powerful tremendous force, then ejaculated bolts of pure, white-hot energy at the caressing touch of the mechanism's hair trigger. Each battery provided enough \"juice,\" as it was known by professionals, for 12,000 well-placed shots. The guns' handy wrist straps prevented them from ever being shot out of the user's hand, and they would respond only to the fingerprints of the user who had imprinted them at the time of manufacture. Lastly, all their moving parts were lubricated with 100% testosterone.\n\"Let's go!\" said Mark. Instead of going via the airlock, he crashed through the forward view window of the shuttle, breath held for the vacuum of dark outer space, and then through the window of the docking bay. Bobby and Snake were right behind him. Waiting for the ship were over a hundred evil terrorists equipped with deadly fanato-rays. A terrific gun battle ensued. Due to the time-altering properties of the energy bolts, whenever a bad guy was shot or exploded, he appeared to be flying through the air in close-up slow-motion. When the firefight was over, Mark had been singed on one forearm and Bobby had taken a terrible hit to his left shoulder, but the 100 terrorists were dead, destroyed, on their way to Hell, and neatly stacked up in a ten-by-five-by-two three-dimensional array of better-off-dead terrorist corpses.\n\"All right,\" growled Mark, oblivious to his pain. \"Let's get to that control room and stop this hideous plot!\"\n\"Master! What will we do?\" begged Shai'tan bin Shai'tan, Abdul Muhammad Garcia's evil and worm-tongued second in command, falling to his knees in front of his leader in the Space Station's control room. \"The maintenance crew was not a true maintenance crew at all, but a cleverly disguised squad of UEFFDL soldiers! They will surely come here and kill us all!\"\n\"Get hold of yourself!\" snapped Abdul, giving Shai'tan a tremendous, back-handed slap across the face. \"Are you a fanatical terrorist warrior, or an effete, soft, westernized American pig-dog-rat-unspecified-but-denigrated-animal?\"\n\"I... Uh... the former,\" said Shai'tan.\n\"Good,\" said Abdul. If Shai'tan had given any other answer, he would unhesitatingly have shot his subordinate and best friend in the face, in spite of their years of close, almost homosexual friendship. \"This control room is solidly protected from outside attack. The walls are impervium thirty centimeters thick.\" (Being an evil terrorist, Abdul naturally thought in terms of the metric system.) \"Cameras survey all routes. The door is bolted. And even if, by some ten-trillionth chance, the Americans should manage to force their way in here, we still have the incredibly powerful FyrePyre Device.\"\n\"Not ... Not the FyrePyre Device!\"\n\"Yes!\"\n\"Surely not ...\"\n\"Yes! Yes!\"\n\"You can't mean\u2014\"\n\"Yes! Yes! Yes!\" Abdul threw back his unshaven head and laughed insanely.\n\"Oh, Master, you are truly an evil genius,\" said Shai'tan.\n\"Thanks,\" said Abdul. \"I appreciate that.\"\nMark, Bobby Lee and Snake rendezvoused just outside the main door to the control room. \"Now how are we gonna get through that?\" asked Bobby Lee. \"That door is pure impervium, and it must be a foot thick.\"\n\"Well,\" said Snake, with his usual grim smile, \"Due to my somewhat shady, perhaps technically illegal, yet always honorable past, I have certain skills that can be applied in a case like this.\" And he took a screwdriver out of his pants pocket.\n\"That won't penetrate impervium,\" pointed out Mark.\n\"Not hardly,\" said Snake. \"But it will do this!\" And with that he worked the screwdriver into the door's hinges and managed to lift up the pin so that he could swing the door out the wrong way. He leaped back and the impervium door crashed onto the metal deck of the space station with a loud BANG!\n\"Come on,\" said Snake. He drew his side-arm and stepped into the Control Room, followed closely by Mark and Bobby Lee.\n\"So, Team Alpha!\" cried Abdul Muhammad Garcia. \"We meet again!\"\n\"And this time you're finished, Abdul!\" said Mark. \"You'll never again plot to destroy America! Now get away from those controls!\"\n\"You may think you have outsmarted me with your clever lift-the-door-pin-off-the-hinges trick. But I have my secret weapon!\"\n\"Secret weapon?\"\n\"The FirePyre Device!\" And with that the crazed terrorist drew the deadly machine out of his pants pocket and flicked it. Three tunnels of hyperdimensional flame reached out from the evil contraption to each of the members of Team Alpha, enveloping them in brightly-colored special effects. They fell backward onto the deck, writhing in pain that was too much even for their incredibly masculine bodies. At last the awful flames died away, leaving our heroes injured and broken on the deck.\n\"I guess as how this is the end,\" said Bobby Lee. \"Mark, Snake, y'all've been the finest comrades in arms a southern gentleman could want.\"\n\"See ya around, guys,\" said Snake. \"Too bad we couldn't save the Earth. Once in a while there just ain't a happy ending.\"\n\"Die, American pig-dog-rat-unspecified-but-denigrated animals!\" said Abdul.\nMark said, \"We're not licked yet. There's one more thing we can do.\"\n\"Ha ha, your bluffs frighten me not at all,\" laughed the evil terrorist.\nMark took something out of his pocket. \"This is an experiment. A device invented by the famous Dr. von Arktype in his secret lab. It's known as an M.I.D., for Masculinity Implosion Device.\"\n\"What ... what does it do?\" asked the terrorist, finally uncertain. Behind him, Shai'tan bin Shai'tan cringed in abject terror.\n\"This,\" said Mark. He triggered the device.\nInstantly, all the testosterone in the room flew to the small black spheroid. The members of Team Alpha cried out in pain and the terrorists screamed high-pitched, womanish screams.\nIn a few seconds the device stopped. Abdul looked down at himself. He had become a woman.\n\"NO-O-O-O-O! NO-O-O-O-O!!!\"\n\"Yes! Yes!\" said Mark. Since the Team Alpha members had such incredibly large stores of testosterone to begin with, they had merely turned into stylishly dressed metrosexuals, while the terrorists had both switched gender.\n\"The Moon-God has abandoned me!\" cried Abdul. And so saying, he performed the last masculine act of which he would ever be capable. He drew his automatic and shot himself repeatedly in both temples.\nMark slowly managed to get up. He went to the controls, ignoring the cringing Shai'tan bin Shai'tan, who was too contemptible to bother with. The space station was coming closer and closer to the Earth. The mighty planet grew in the forward viewscreens, showing a cloudless surface with North and South America showing. The space station began to scream through Earth's upper atmosphere.\nWith a mighty heave, Mark wrenched the wheel to the side. The Space Station made a J-curve and flew back into the inner Solar system. Earth was saved.\nBarton Paul Levenson has a degree in physics. Happily married to genre poet Elizabeth Penrose, his being both a liberal Democrat and a born-again Christian just confuses everybody. He has about 30 published short stories and three novels coming out this year or next year.","source-hostname":"AtomJack Magazine"}

There was a sweet dampness in the late March air. As the melted snow ran into the gutters, and patches of grass sprouted wet and green, it wasn\u2019t uncommon to see a black bear crossing traffic, or muskrats in the subways. There was a theory that the cause was something concerning magnetic fields and cell phone signals. That it confused the animals\u2019 honing instincts.\nAt first there were newspaper photos with cute captions. CITY LIFE IS A ZOO! But then people began to feel uneasy about it. It seemed unnatural. Portentous. No longer cute. Some religious groups called it the end of the world. People began to board up their windows and store their water in jugs.\nPhoebe was walking through the airport, crossing the great domed food court, when she saw a large cat-like animal run by. A bobcat? she wondered. It was swift, low to the ground, and she caught a flash of its intelligent golden eyes as it sped past the Sbarro\u2019s. People retracted, scattered, there were screams.\nFaster than she could process what was happening, two uniformed National Guardsmen sprung out from opposite directions, holding rifles. \u201cStand clear!\u201d yelled one of them. Two gunshots cracked out, and the animal fell dead. The airport was silent.\nAfter a paused moment\u2019s catch of breath, people moved on their way again. All but Phoebe and a man with a long white beard, wearing layers of rags. She assumed he was one of the teeming homeless who populated the town. They were everywhere now. The two of them stood looking down at the dead animal.\nIt was a lynx, pale brown with dark spotted legs. Phoebe had only ever seen them in photographs, or stuffed behind glass at the museum. It had long tufts of fur under its chin and above the eyes, and ears rather flat to its head. Beautiful in its unrealness. It looks like Genghis Khan, she thought, but didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.\nShe and the homeless man looked up at the same time, and locked eyes for a moment. There were a couple of people from the Earth Liberation Front shouting threats at the gunmen. There was also a church group passing out tracts. One carried a sign that said ASK THE ANIMALS AND THEY WILL TEACH YOU JOB 12:7.\nThe bearded man had pale blue eyes. \u201cA terrible thing,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nHe looked at the man with the Bible sign, who was shouting at one of the Earth activists. He shook his head.\n\u201cYou know ... I\u2019m retired military,\u201d he muttered softly. \u201cI remember the days of the one hundred yen dollar. The world was ending then, too.\u201d\nShe nodded. She was feeling a bit sick. The gunshots still rung in her ears.\nThe man, like a father, patted her on the shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, young lady. Somehow the world always manages to right itself.\u201d\nShe was disarmed by it, a little staggered. When was the last time she had been touched by a stranger?\nPhoebe had just been fired from her job. She was an artist. Under the new Public Art Ordinance, public art was a requirement for all major construction projects. Phoebe was commissioned to create art for the airport. At the age of twenty-two, not even out of college, she was considered to be the next great thing.\nShe was known for her nature-based work, most of it large and abstract. Fig leaves, tree rings. Spider webs. All of these rendered hugely in limestone, plaster, mirrors, and glass.\n\u201cI\u2019m fascinated by repeat patterns, the things that connect us all. Plant and animal.\u201d This was her quote, printed in a glossy magazine. She had also been invited to pose for a fashion spread, as she was young and slim and beautiful. \u201cLike a Nordic queen!\u201d the stylist said, delighted with her high cheekbones and long, cornhusk hair. They dressed her in bright silk butterfly wings, painted her lips a wet fuchsia. Posed her on a tree stump under sun-spangled leaves, her skirt hiked to reveal her slender thighs. Flora and Fauna, the article was titled. And in the corner of one of the pages was a small black and white photo of Phoebe working in her studio, hair tied in a rag, covered in plaster dust.\nThere was grant money, lots of it. There were dinner parties in mansions. There were older, wealthier men who wanted to date her. It all moved very quickly. Phoebe wasn\u2019t used to the attention, the validation. She had always been the quiet girl, the good girl, who flew under the radar. She attended public school and got good grades. She won a modest scholarship to the state university. Phoebe always worried that she was mediocre, not blessed with vision or greatness. But now ... sometimes she felt as though she would burst with goodwill. Life had become what she had always wished it to be. And maybe she had willed it so.\nShe worked very hard on the new airport pieces. She was energized by her work, it flowed through her fingertips. It was kept secret until it was finished. And then she couldn\u2019t wait to show it to the board and the public.\nThe opening was celebrated with a lavish party. Phoebe was beaming in a dark blue kimono dress. She wore a large uncut ruby on a chain at her throat, a gift from the son of a state Supreme Court justice. The ruby was warm to the touch, like a living thing. Everyone took her picture, called her a genius, and christened her new work a raving success.\nBut then, two weeks later, members of the committee called her in for a meeting at the airport.\n\u201cThere is a problem,\u201d they said. \u201cThere are complaints about some of the new pieces.\u201d\nThe most prominent of these included a huge, magnified image of Phoebe\u2019s left eye. Also there was her fingerprint, four feet high, superimposed on a mirror.\nThe public didn\u2019t like them. Were disturbed by them. There had been an increase in petty crime since the pieces were installed. There was fighting among the passengers. Graffiti in the bathrooms. And worse.\n\u201cBut ... I don\u2019t understand. How is my work to blame?\u201d\n\u201cWell ...\u201d an airport official, a middle aged man in a suit, looked down, then up again, \u201cMy guess is that the pieces inspire feelings of paranoia. Retinal scans, digitized fingerprints. You know? Biometric monitoring! Everything\u2019s found, everything\u2019s archived nowadays. And people just want to be anonymous. It\u2019s all too close to the bone. People lash out. It\u2019s all unconscious. It\u2019s not your fault. But that eyeball ...\u201d\n\u201cBut these pieces are supposed to be about what connects us all as living beings!\u201d\n\u201cBut they're seeing Big Brother! They would have responded better, I think, to something such as your gingko leaves, your seashells. Pretty things. You know, nature.\u201d\n\u201cBut the work is me! Am I not nature, too? And you? And you?\u201d\nThe art director interrupted, \u201cWell, the art world is like an ecosystem! The artist, the work, the given space ... they\u2019re all interactive. It\u2019s all encompassing. I\u2019m sorry, Phoebe. That's nature.\u201d\nPhoebe was fired unceremoniously, her contract broken. Her head was already spinning when she walked through the food court and saw the lynx run by. Maybe, she thought, that\u2019s why the scene had such significance for her. She couldn\u2019t get it out of her head.\nOne Wednesday evening, Phoebe sat at her computer, trying to update her resume. But she couldn\u2019t focus. She looked out the window. Twilight was coming a little later now. The sky was a pale yellow. She had not left her apartment in days. Food was running out. She knew there were plans to make. There was action to be taken. But she hadn\u2019t the energy.\nThe phone rang.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\u201cPhoebe Edwards?\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cEllen Pierce. I am the head of the Claridge School. If you don\u2019t know us, we are a private school, K through eight. We are very renowned.\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll cut to the chase: I like you. I\u2019m very sorry to hear how things are going for you. How terrible. The philistines. They don\u2019t understand a talent like yours. Your work wasn\u2019t meant to be consumed by the masses like fast food! \u201c\n\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d Her mind was sluggish, confused.\n\u201cWell, I have an open position. Art instructor. Great benefits. Would you consider? At least for a while? I\u2019d be proud to have you.\u201c\n\u201cUm, we could talk about it. \u201d\nThey set up an interview for Friday afternoon. Phoebe could not see herself as a teacher of children, but at least her life would be taking some direction.\nEveryone knew the Claridge School. Celebrities, bankers, media moguls sent their children there. It was located in a large new building uptown. Phoebe stood for a moment outside, staring at the security camera over the door. It shamed her that she was feeling so intimidated by an elementary school.\nSomeone buzzed her in. Instantly, she felt a sense of unreality. The place felt much larger on the inside then she would have guessed. The lobby was two stories high. The front desk was enormous and round, topped with rich brown granite flecked with mica. There was a pillar in the center of the room in the shape of a goddess, holding a globe above her head. A woman came out from the desk to greet her. She led Phoebe through a hallway lined floor to ceiling with huge bubbling aquariums. Finally, they entered an office with low graceful furniture and glass brick walls.\nThe woman who waited for her was chic, starved looking, with dark lips, high cheekbones, and a swingy asymmetrical haircut.\n\u201cI like the angelfish. In the tanks,\u201d Phoebe said shyly. She was frankly overwhelmed.\nThe woman smiled at her warmly, as though Phoebe were a cherished child. \u201cI\u2019m Ellen Pierce. I\u2019m so glad you came.\u201d\nEllen Pierce explained to her the responsibilities of the job. She had only to teach one or two classes a day. The responsibilities were typical of any art teacher\u2019s job. But there was one thing: the art teacher was to choose each child\u2019s best work at the year\u2019s end, and then write a blurb for it, in a style such as you\u2019d find in a catalogue for the Guggenheim.\n\u201cCritical essays? On the work of five year olds?\u201d\n\u201cWell, not so much as an essay per se ... It\u2019s a cute thing, really. Just a couple of paragraphs. We mount it and frame it next to the work. A keepsake. The parents love it!\u201d\n\u201cBut ... I just ... the decadence! This is like pre-revolutionary France!\u201d\nEllen Pierce let out a guffaw. So was it a joke then?\nWhen Phoebe got up to leave, she told the woman that she would think over the offer. But she already knew that she would take it. For a teaching job, it paid an exorbitant amount. Plus she would live for free in the faculty housing on the top floor. At least it would give her a place to go until she figured out what to do next.\nAnd as Phoebe walked back through the lobby, the bell rang to let the children out for the afternoon. Here they came down a marble and glass staircase, the boys in button down shirts and khakis, the girls all in pink uniform jumpers. They lined up straight and tall by class, in row after row. Her pupils. They looked unworldly, golden. Full of promise and the future. These were the children who would one day take the reins of this world.\nShe had a heavy, sinking feeling as she pushed open the door. How did it come to this? The life that she thought was hers was gone. All the promise that she held, squandered. Was she a victim of negative forces? Or just bad luck?\nAnyhow, she thought, it would not be forever.\nFor three years, Phoebe taught at the school, living on the top floor and rarely leaving.\nThe school, at least, was safe. Because the outside world seemed crazier than ever. A training camp for activists for left wing causes had sprung up in the warehouse down the street. The activists fought with the evangelists who fought with the Earth Liberation Front. The National Guard kept an uneasy presence.\nMeanwhile, the animals still in fluxed into the city. A group of guerilla engineers were determined to find ways to understand why. They created robotic swans with cameras in them. They put them into the lakes to interact with the real, wild swans so that their behavior could be studied. ROBOSWAN! screamed the newspapers.\nNothing seemed real.\nPhoebe was happy to live shut away, quiet, like a sponge in the sea. Her hair grew long, and she kept it plaited in a single braid down her back. She loved the children in a way she would never have thought possible. They were such pure, innocent spirits, and they loved Phoebe, too. They did artwork with paint and wood and sand. She even had fun writing the vanity critiques. Matthew\u2019s self portrait in oils is bright and bold, reminiscent of the better American Impressionists of the late period. Phoebe\u2019s comments were mounted handsomely alongside the work, and framed with dark wood. And everyone was happy.\n\u201cWe\u2019re lucky to be here, aren\u2019t we?\u201d asked one of her colleagues, a pale languid man with a blonde ponytail who taught history. \u201cI mean, true academic jobs are tough to break into. And besides, the world is such a rotten place nowadays. I honestly feel better in here. I mean, at least we\u2019re safe.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose we are.\u201d\nBut at night sometimes, she thought about her art, her old life. She wasn\u2019t creating. What if her gift was gone? After all, it had now been three years.\nIt was only on these nights that she felt real fear, her heart beating, her skin damp.\nIt was in the fall of that third year that a new student was brought to her. The girl was a genius, an artistic prodigy, she was told. But she was very sad. Her father, a venture capitalist, had gone missing. The story was that he had gone to a travel agency that catered only to the very wealthy. The agency didn\u2019t even have a name, it was so exclusive. People called it \u201cThe Black Box,\u201d and it specialized in the unattainable, adventures that even the regular well-to-do couldn\u2019t have. The girl\u2019s father, and a group of three other men, had requested to be dropped into the Amazon with nothing but their knives.\nMonths passed by, and no one could find the men, though there were expeditions into the rainforest to find them. It was feared that they were killed or kidnapped by the indigenous people. The only trace was a monogrammed Rolex, now worn by a brilliantly painted and feathered Indian man. And he would not speak.\nBettina, the little girl, was eleven. She, too, was silent, but had been lashing out in other ways. She wouldn\u2019t do her schoolwork. She ran away from home twice. She\u2019d gotten in trouble most recently for stealing ammonium nitrate from a neighbor\u2019s garage. Her mother thought it was a good time to move out of the suburbs and make a new start in the city.\nShe was pointed out to Phoebe, a tall little girl with white blonde hair, standing in the line with the other girls in their pink jumpers. Phoebe studied her fragile, narrow shoulders, and was struck with overwhelming pity. Then the girl turned around. And her pale grey eyes, with their transparent lashes, startled Phoebe with a flash of knowing directness, and her thoughts went scattered.\n\u201cJust wait until you see how this girl can paint,\u201d they said. \u201cLike an angel.\u201d\n\u201cI notice that a some of your work has a religious theme, Bettina.\u201d\nThe detail was incredible. Phoebe had never seen a religious painting with such an intimate feel. Jesus was bathed in clear crystalline light, and gazing straight into the eyes of the viewer. He looked like a carpenter, a working class hero. A real person.\n\u201cYes. The only thing I read besides mathematical texts is the Holy Bible.\u201d\nThey were alone in the art room, with Bettina\u2019s canvases spread about the room. Phoebe came upon the next one, a skyscape of flaring light.\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s called Aurora Borealis.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know what to say! It\u2019s remarkable.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You don\u2019t have to say anything.\u201d Bettina gave a small, one-shouldered shrug.\nThe painting of the sky stirred something in Phoebe, a mix of wonder and regret. \u201cI used to do nature paintings, too. My first was a sea anemone. I spent months on the details ...\u201d It didn\u2019t seem fair that this young girl had so much talent. Again, Phoebe felt as though she\u2019d wasted her life. At Bettina\u2019s age, she had certainly shown talent. But maybe she had just not lived enough. All that carefully honed solitude, the good grades and the people pleasing. Maybe she should have gone wild, done drugs. She\u2019d been such a good girl all her life. Too good.\nPhoebe then felt guilty for her jealousy. This was a child, after all. A child genius who had just lost her father, and was now trotted around on all the talk shows. \u201cHow are you liking school? How are you feeling?\u201d\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been in so many greenroom therapy lessons, I don\u2019t know how to talk about my feelings anymore. \u201c She grimaced. \u201cI just like to do my art. Focus, total focus, is the only the thing that makes me feel free. Things would not be so good for me otherwise.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine growing up nowadays.\u201d Phoebe rarely left the school anymore. She didn\u2019t like going past the homeless, always lined up and waiting for the motorcades to come by. She always looked for her friend, the man with the white beard, but he was never among them.\nThe worst new thing to happen was the return of the funeral pyres. At least in the school you couldn\u2019t smell them. How could people eat and breathe, with the smell of death everywhere?\n\u201cWell,\u201d the girl said, \u201cthe world may seem very confusing now. It\u2019s a building up. A rising tide. The hive mind building upon itself. It\u2019s OK. Things are just changing into something else. Patterns will become apparent. Connections that you can\u2019t see now.\u201d\nThe world always manages to right itself. \u201cBut how do you know?\u201d\n\u201cMy father was a powerful man. He had access to information that regular people don\u2019t. I miss him. He would talk to me like an adult. We would have the best conversations. I miss him.\u201d\nThere were paintings of the cosmos, paintings of the girl\u2019s baby brother. Then Phoebe saw the one that stopped her heart.\nIt was a painting of a lynx. Majestic in profile, it\u2019s eyes scanning the horizon. Its black tipped ear tufts, its intelligent golden eyes. It was gloriously alive, with a halo of light around its head.\nShe had no words. She felt herself brimming with emotion that she couldn\u2019t name.\nFinally, the child said, \u201cI painted that from a vision, you know.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\u201cI know they\u2019re not real, but I have these animal visions. Animals that come to me. My grandmother could read flames of the fire, and tell you what they meant. I\u2019ve got a little of that.\u201d\n\u201cThe lynx came to you in a vision?\u201d\n\u201cHe started coming to me when my father went missing. I was angry. I was hating the world. The lynx started coming to me at night in my room. He would come, lick my hand, and disappear. I don\u2019t know why he came, but he gave me strength. Then some nights after the lynx, a white dove came and landed on my bedpost. And I knew I\u2019d be alright.\u201d\nAt that point, the child\u2019s mother came in to take the girl home. She was tall, blonde and beautiful, with a Hermes scarf tied around her shoulders. Phoebe recognized her from the talk shows, her tear stained visage now composed, resigned, and down to business. She started to gather up the canvases. As she and Bettina started out the door with arms loaded, the little girl said, \u201cGoodbye, teacher.\u201d The mother turned, and over her shoulder, gave a sad, but knowing, smile.\nThe little girl said something as they walked down the hall, then laughed. It was a lovely, carefree child\u2019s laugh, ringing like tinkling crystal.\nPhoebe woke up in the middle of the night, feeling hot and panicked. It was three AM, and she felt unable to lay still. She went to the bathroom to wet her face. Then she turned on a lamp so she could read for a while.\nBut her mind couldn\u2019t follow the words. She was distracted by memories of the dream that had woken her. In the stillness the dream was coming back, piece by piece: she was sitting in a darkened theatre, watching her own life unfold in a series of small, well-lit scenes, each in its own bubble of light: Phoebe the little girl, staring at a fuzzy moth in a jar. Then Phoebe at fifteen, her first kiss. It was a sun burnt blonde boy, at night in a parking lot: she\u2019d anticipated this first kiss for so long, that now she couldn\u2019t feel it at all. Next Phoebe, quietly ecstatic, chiseling plaster at twenty-one. Finally, Phoebe in the airport, and the gunshots, and the comforting touch of a homeless ex-military man.\nIf all these selves could see her now, what would they say?\nThe dream had gone on for hours, it felt.\nI\u2019ve got to move before I jump out of my skin. She needed a change of scene. Putting on a robe and slippers, she left her dormitory room to walk downstairs.\nThe front lobby of the school was huge and cold. She thought of the first time she had walked into the school, how confused and vulnerable she\u2019d been, what a fool you had been! said a voice unbidden. Maybe, she thought. But what was I supposed to do? And anyway, the children. There they were in a framed photograph on the wall, all of the grades gathered together. Their faces like little petals that could scatter in the wind. Who could say they\u2019re not worth it all? She looked for Bettina\u2019s face but didn\u2019t see it.\nThere were sirens outside, and shouts in the distance. But the sky was beautiful. Tinged with just enough morning light so it burned cobalt. It made her racing mind go quiet. Staring at that sky, with her face pressed to the glass, Phoebe felt expansive. As though she could float in that sky, grow enormous, lose her edges completely.\nI could open this door, she thought. This one door, this one security code, stands between me and out there. All at once she was aware of her own youth, her strong beating heart, her clear lungs, the light in her veins. If she could only leave this place, there is something that can be reclaimed. Something noble and good. I can start again. I can start with this sky. I can start with this silence. I can start with a single blade of grass. With a single human hello. Then I\u2019ll work from there.\nSuddenly, there was a single loud gunshot. She saw an animal limping quickly by. It was a wounded coyote. It darted off into the night, trailing blood. Seeing the blood, Phoebe felt as though there were a mute explosion inside her body. In an almost detached way, she observed the anger and grief that were overwhelming her; a howling inside growing louder, stronger, until she felt carried away by its flow. It sent her out the door, into the night, her own blood pounding in her ears. Pounding a rhythm that sounded like no more no more no more. Because she would find the gunman, and this time she would stop him.\nThe gunman was not a man at all, but a boy of seventeen. A boy who did not like killing, so he told himself that killing the animals was not a personal act, that he was performing the work of nature.\nHe was startled to see a white robed woman in the moonlight, coming straight toward him. At first he thought it was an apparition. The feeling was ancient, bigger than himself. The woman immediately called to mind stories of mythology that he loved. He had studied it in school. Stories of gods and goddesses, shape shifters, animal messengers. Always there was drama, retribution. He had been reading Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses when they took him out of school and told him he would learn to shoot a gun. He wondered if he would ever go to school again. He hoped very much that he would. Because he was tired, he was lonely. Tired of wandering alone with his gun, only to sleep in the corner on a bare mattress with all the other sad boys. It wasn\u2019t the life he wanted. Frankly, he had been thinking of strapping a bomb to himself. He\u2019d walk to his parents\u2019 house or his old school and blow himself up.\nThe woman was running now, and she was shouting something. But what was she saying? Her eyes trained right on his, fierce and unwavering. It was the first time anyone had looked him in the eye in a very long time. It felt unsettling, but good. He lowered his gun to the ground. If this was a goddess, then her message was for him alone.\nLeah Erickson has had work published most recently in Indigenous Fiction, Pennsylvania English, The Saint Ann's Review, Sub-Lit, and Unlikely Stories.

She's in a war zone, and she might get stopped, although, actually, the war zone is far north of San Francisco, beyond Marin County. The Navy keeps the Bay Area peaceful, or so she's heard, except for skirmishes in Golden Gate Park and the seashore, and that's six miles away. She can't even hear gunfire.\nShe's not quite alone. I'm with her in spirit, which I hope will be enough. I've taught her everything I can and have given her more courage than she knew she had. She had to pass through three checkpoints to get from her home in the Walnut Creek to the city, and the search at the toll booth at the Oakland Bay Bridge terrified her. But the soldiers were looking for weapons, not for the stolen art in a shoebox in her totebag. They were hardly older than her high school students and just as bored. They didn't even ask why she was headed to the city, so she didn't have to explain that she was visiting her sick mother, a lie that her husband had believed.\nSan Francisco's skyscrapers, hills, and touristy bustle have always fascinated her. Walnut Creek's bland malls and ranch homes provide a nice place to raise a family, but her son now lives with her ex-husband in Ohio. When the telephones work, the boy can talk about nothing but the Icon War. \"They should call it wars, it's so big,\" he says, as if \"big\" means \"good.\" Her current husband won't talk about it at all.\nShe walks up the gloomy streets near Telegraph Hill, where only a few streetlights work, and passes a burned-out storefront. Its sign, warped by the fire, reads \"First Church of Christ, Scientist, Reading Room.\" Although she never much cared for Christian Scientists, she suddenly feels sorry for them. She had gone to a Methodist church as a child and learned that Jesus could console her in times of trouble and pain but couldn't seem to prevent them\u2014a very limited god, basically harmless, she realizes now. Religion isn't worth so much destruction.\nAt the corner of Kearny Street, she looks south toward the financial district. The skyscrapers barely glimmer against the night sky. A year ago, lights had blazed in thousands of windows as employees worked late stock brokerages and corporate offices. Now there's no need to work round-the-clock. She's a history teacher, and she knows that wars are good for very few businesses. She shakes her head, turns the other way, and starts to climb the sidewalk, which is really a long concrete stairway.\nIt's like a Maya pyramid, she suddenly thinks. The pyramids imitated mountains, and with stairways that led to the temple at the top. She's never actually seen one, and she hopes they survive this war. So do I.\nA siren sounds only a couple of blocks away. She grips the tote bag with white knuckles. The siren fades, but she doesn't relax. Kearny Street is too steep for much traffic. In fact there's hardly any traffic anywhere, and the city seems empty without tourists. She's alone and obvious, slightly plump, slightly wrinkled, slightly gray, a rebel against modern medical marketing, and she worries that this might mark her as a free thinker. She's not on anyone's side; does that mean she's an enemy of both sides?\nShe spots her destination in the middle of the block, a narrow wooden row house three stories high with bay windows and a fancy arch over the front door, painted powder blue with navy trim. She marvels at the price the house would fetch in normal real estate prices, and realizes that she had expected a warehouse or something like that, not a home.\nAt the door, she worries about a trap, glances around but tries not to act suspicious, takes a calming breath, and thinks about what it will be to meet another ... art lover? Free thinker? Rebel? Could she be a rebel? She knows she's a nice, middle-aged high school teacher\u2014but she could be a rebel, too, couldn't she? She likes that idea because she was raised at a time when rebellion, even radicalism, seemed romantic. To some, she supposes, she might be the enemy. She doesn't like that idea. She's for peace, isn't she? No more wars, no more enemies, no more us-versus-them. Those were the radical ideas of her youth: everyone nice, friendly, and happy. A peaceful rebellion.\nThe sound of Mozart's Eine kleine Nachtmusic filters through the frosted glass of the windows, which suggests that the inhabitant might have a sense of history and culture and art, like herself. That's what she really is, she decides, an art lover. Someone well-off can keep the vase in her totebag safe, and the money paid for it will rescue more art and books. She would love to keep the vase, even a photo, but her town sometimes searches homes for contrabands. She rings the bell.\nNo one answers. Should she ring again? Then she hears faint footsteps, and a young-looking man opens the door. He's astonishingly handsome, with high cheekbones and wide shoulders.\n\"Hello,\" she says. \"I'm looking for Michael.\"\nHe smiles, not very genuinely. \"You must be Irene. Please come in. Don't worry, there aren't any surveillance cameras in this neighborhood, I make sure of it.\"\nThe code marks art lovers. In 740 A.D., Byzantine Emperor Constantine V ordered the destruction of religious icons to prove that he headed the church as well as the state. The Iconoclasts, the icon breakers, went to war with the Iconodules, the icon makers. Empress Irene temporarily suppressed the Iconoclasts in 787, and Emperor Michael III finally stopped them in 843, but much art had been lost, and Byzantium and Rome had parted ways for good.\nThe New Iconoclasts have more ambitious goals: Get rid of all religion, erase its symbols, and the world will be a better place. The war began in earnest when atomic blasts razed Jerusalem, an assault against all three big monotheisms at once. The teacher, \"Irene,\" rejects the 'Clasts and their simplistic arguments, but she feels no better about the 'Dules, who get inspiration from one faith or another or from a mere will to power. Most people, like her husband, try to remain neutral and alive, and until recently, she had tried to do that, but the loss of art and culture, of the artifacts of history, ate at her soul.\nInside Michael's house, the living room is crammed with antique furniture and works of art, none of them religious, and the window glass that had looked frosted from outside is clear from the inside and shows a view of the dark street. He turns off the music with a gesture at a remote sensor and directs her to a sofa upholstered in gold-colored cut velvet and framed with inlaid wood. She feels underdressed in her practical tee-shirt and jeans, and overwhelmed by the opulence. Michael sits beside her, dressed in a tailor-made blue business shirt and dark wool slacks. He is flawless, from his haircut and teeth to his weight and smooth skin. Ageless. He has used every medical miracle that she has spurned.\nShe's sweating despite the night's cool ocean breeze and would like to ask for a glass of water, but she wants even more to share the wonderful treasure she's brought. She sets the shoe box on a low, gilt-edged table in front of them, pulls on cotton gloves, and unwraps the silken tissue paper around the vase. He leans forward.\nWhat a treasure: a worn and stained seven-inch cylindrical vase made of painted clay. When she first saw it, she had to strain to make out the red and black figures from what remained of a white background. From a distance, the vase looks mottled pink-brown and unimportant. She picks it up gingerly and glances at him. He seems disappointed.\n\"It's Maya,\" she says hastily. \"Around 600 A.D. It was in the Princeton Museum.\"\n\"Someone got in? Through the sniper fire? For this?\"\nShe turns it to show a particular part of the scene painted on the vase. \"These two standing figures are the Hero Twins. They've gone\nto ...\" She had listened rapt to the curator, who had risked his life to rescue the work. At home she studied everything in her history books about the Maya civilization. She remembers the name of the underworld. \"... They've gone to Xibalb\u00e1, that's the Maya name for hell, to defeat the demons of death that live there. They're disguised as vagabond magicians, and they're about to sacrifice this man to trick the demons.\" She points to some seated figures that look like arrogant aristocrats. \"These are the demons.\"\n\"Is this important?\"\nBelieve me, it is very important. I said I'm here in spirit. That's because I am a spirit\u2014a god, actually, one of the Hero Twins depicted on the vase. I'm Ix'balank\u00e9, or First Jaguar in your language. I'm the vagabond magician on the left. The curator and Irene didn't mean to invoke me, but they did when they risked their lives for me. I need followers to join the side of the gods. The world has enough art lovers. It needs soldiers. If she decides to follow me, she will not hesitate to fight, and I believe I can convert her.\n\"This is one of the central myths of the Maya,\" Irene says, annoyed. \"The story of the Hero Twins is very long. This is just a single scene.\"\n\"I mean this vase. Is it important?\"\n\"It's history. It tells you what people thought about themselves and their world.\"\n\"Demons and hell, that's something to think about.\" He smirks.\n\"And heros. The Twins were heros.\"\n\"Look, I collect art.\"\n\"It's not just art. We're destroying what makes us human.\"\n\"You're not one of those true believers, are you?\"\nI'm starting to worry that Irene has learned nothing of my ways: resourcefulness and even deceit. She should look at my image on the vase. I pretend to be a showman and my face is disguised by a catfish mask, for I can be utterly humble when I need to be\u2014but I am a glorious god. If Michael wants art, we can sell it to him. Believe in me. Think beyond your frustration, Irene.\n\"Well?\" Michael says. \"These are guys in loin cloths. Is that important to humanity?\"\nShe looks up, startled out of her thoughts. \"Art. I believe in art.\" She remembers what the curator had told her about my trip to hell. She had come here with a purpose. \"The work of the artist is exceptional. His name\u2014here, you can see the signature on the bottom of the vase\u2014is Eighteen-Rabbit.\" She points to a hieroglyphic. \"Each bar stands for five. Three bars and three dots. Each dot stands for one. That's eighteen altogether, and this is obviously a rabbit.\"\n\"Signed by the artist? You can read this?\" He leans in closer.\n\"That much.\" She tries to cinch the deal. \"The museum's probably going to fall soon and its collection will be cleansed. There's going to be a lot less Maya art in the world when that happens.\"\nHe shrugs, smiling. \"How do the 'Dules hang on?\"\nShe realizes that she should feign friendliness. \"I heard that in the European Union, they agreed to hand everything over to the tourist boards.\"\n\"They lost?\" He smiles wider.\nAs she had heard it, they won, or at least the faction that was willing to sell out to business interests. Internal dissent fragments the 'Dules. Michael's smile makes her nervous. \"The tourist industry wants things intact, whatever's left.\"\n\"Is there a lot?\"\n\"Enough, I suppose. It's hard to get news you can trust.\"\n\"They're still after the Pope.\" He seems to consider that good news. \"He's in Nigeria, but he won't last long because ebola's there now. It makes a great weapon, and his soldiers are defecting for medicine. So much for faith in the afterlife.\"\nI have faith. I traveled to hell to fight the demons who spread illness around the world. Irene thinks about that and notices that the demons on the vase seem rather handsome, like Michael. She decides to test him. \"They say that Russia's front is growing, but I wonder if they're really doing it for the Orthodox Church or if they want to recapture their old territories.\"\nHe laughs and claps her on the shoulder. \"For a minute I was afraid you were going to be some whiny New Ager or something. I work in medicine, so I run into them all the time. Nurses are the worst.\"\nAt the high school where she teaches, no one dares to say much out loud, but when they whisper in groups of two and three in the parking lot, they talk politics. An art teacher hooked her up with the artifact-rescuing underground. She knew enough history to doubt the shibboleth that religion has caused nothing besides wars and atrocities. After she saw the vase, she learned about the Maya religion. Nothing had prepared her for a glimpse of me, of a splendor eclipsing the god she had learned about as a child. That deity was just a warm and fuzzy higher power who mostly seemed to help people in Twelve Step programs. I slay demons.\n\"I teach history,\" she says, not willing to say much more that might identify herself.\n\"History? Okay, teach me about this vase. What's the history here? What were these people thinking?\"\nShe takes a deep breath. \"The Maya personified forces of nature. One of the Hero Twins, this one,\" and she points to me, \"will become the sun after they defeat the king of hell.\"\n\"The sun?\" Michael laughs.\n\"The sun, that's right,\" she says, falling into her familiar role as a teacher while she fights an urge to flee. I hope she has learned from my example of courage.\n\"The sun is a golden jaguar. A jaguar was the most powerful being the Maya knew of. At night, the sun turns into a black jaguar and crosses the sky from west to east, and sometimes it crosses paths with the moon and causes eclipses.\"\nMichael laughs harder. Irene laughs in self-protection. Apparently he has no idea of how much math, what a leap of logic went into figuring out that the sun plays a role in lunar eclipses. She does, and I'm at her elbow, invisible and powerful as a shadow.\n\"The myths say there was a false sun,\" she says, and closes her eyes to remember the story. \"A bird called Seven Macaw claimed to be the sun, but it really wanted to make itself rich and take over the world, and its light only reached to the horizon, not everywhere. The Hero Twins had to get rid of it to prepare the world for people.\"\nI remember. My brother and I fought hard and got seriously wounded, but we didn't defeat vainglorious greed once and for all. It took me a long time to realize that. And I became the true sun without knowing what eternity meant and how long I would have to fight for humanity.\nOur legends say that the people of the Earth rejoiced at the first sunrise. Yes, human beings existed before I became the sun. You waited anxiously for the first dawn, and danced and wept for joy and burned incense as you saw the eastern sky grow slowly brighter. Lions roared, birds sang, and fish climbed up on the riverbanks to watch.\nDon't scoff. You've actually seen the first sunrise through telescopes. The first stars lit the universe less than billion years after the Big Bang. NASA burned rocket fuel like incense to carry the Hubble Telescope to the sky. With it, you saw the first stars flash into being like fireworks. The sight spread joy at CalTech, SUNY, and the Keck Telescope in Hawaii.\nThe sun won't last forever, and five billion years from now, I, Ix'balank\u00e9, will explode and die. But the universe is built better than that. Time flows in endless, complex cycles. I could be reborn as a new sun with new planets. Will you follow me or will I die forever? And forever is a long, long time.\nMetaphors, you say, proud of your generosity to primitive faith, but I was created by scientists using the tools they had. We have since learned a lot, and I have forgotten nothing. When I cross the path of the moon, I cause eclipses. You know that's true, you just use the word \"shadow.\" And you know so little of what \"shadow\" really means.\nIrene knows, though. She thinks about me, stops laughing, and looks at the vase, searching for a detail that will distract Michael. She has been willing to follow me this far, into the lair of a demon, but now that she has seen one, will she go farther? All I can do is persuade her with my example.\n\"Here's something interesting,\" she says. \"Here's the artist himself, Eighteen Rabbit, a rabbit-scribe, recording the scene.\" She points to a timid rabbit sitting cross-legged on the floor, brush in hand, paper ready.\n\"Really?\" Michael forgets his skepticism for a moment and leans over, grinning. \"Oh, yeah, with a little loin cloth and everything. Self-referential. Great.\"\n\"And here,\" she says, \"a single line depicts the posture of the demon. You can see his arrogance. Very fluid artwork, utterly graceful lines, and you can count every bead on this servant's bracelets. This owl that's perched on the hat of the king of hell, it's a masterpiece. The artist was a genius.\"\nIndeed, he caught the malignancy of the owl perfectly, but there's more to it than that.\n\"Eighteen Rabbit took plenty of liberties,\" Irene says. \"He shows not just religion, he shows you history. What you see is really a depiction of nobility watching a performance, very sanitized and prettified. It's not hell at all.\"\nShe remembers the story, duly reported in the only sacred book of mine that wasn't burned by the Conquistadors, and she shudders.\nMichael grins and puts a patronizing arm around her shoulders. \"Is hell that bad?\"\nIt was. I remember. Every breath reeked of pus and blood and smoke and decay.\n\"It smells awful,\" Irene says, \"and there's a sort of sickly twilight in the caverns, because hell is in caverns beneath the earth, and animals prowl the shadows. They hunt down souls and rip them apart, and the screams echo constantly.\"\n\"No flames? No people being roasted?\"\n\"Yes, that, too. When the Twins first arrived, the demons tortured them and burned them alive and then dumped their ashes into a river, a river full of pus and blood.\"\nMichael squeezes her shoulder. \"Cool.\"\nShe wants to push off his embrace and his cologne irritates her. For a moment she ponders the pain of being burned alive, but she continues. \"The demons won the first round because the Twins were overconfident, but the Heros were cunning and knew they had to outwit the demons or every human soul would wind up in hell eventually. There was no one else who could protect humanity. So they re-formed their ashes into fish.\"\n\"They were magicians, right?\"\n\"They were gods.\" For a moment she realizes that, for my brother and I, our failure hurt more than the flames. It's one thing to fail yourself, but it's another to fail all humanity. \"First they became fish, and then men, and they disguised themselves as beggar magicians whose souls had just arrived into hell. That's why they have the catfish masks, because they had been fish.\"\nMichael studies the vase, seeing more now. Irene sees how much isn't depicted on the vase. The vase shows us finely dressed, but actually we wore rags.\n\"The demons heard about the magicians and sent their guards to get them, and the guards entertained themselves during the trip by beating the Twins.\"\n\"Some things never change.\"\n\"The twins put on a show, and they killed a dog and brought it back to life. Then the king had the guards bring them a man.\"\n\"That's this man here?\"\n\"That's right.\"\n\"Turn the vase. Let me get a better look.\"\nIrene complies. The prisoner is bound tightly but looks well otherwise, and magic flows from my brother to him. But she realizes that reality must have been different, and it was. The prisoner had been whipped and starved. Ropes bound his hands and feet so tightly that gangrene blackened his fingers and toes.\n\"The demon king ordered the magicians to sacrifice him and bring him back to life, like the dog, so they cut open his chest and took out his heart.\"\nShe wonders what is it like to kill a man. Would it be easier knowing he will be brought back to life? No, it wasn't. We laid him on an altar and I raised the knife. The man watched it descend with defeated eyes, too dumbed by agony to scream as I tore open his chest. I held up his heart, still beating, for my sadistic audience. I was sorry to do it, but I had to keep up my disguise if I was going to defeat them.\n\"Too bad that's not shown here,\" Michael says.\n\"Then they brought the man back to life,\" Irene says, shrugging off his arm.\nThe mortal, finding himself alive again, didn't thank me. In fact he looked at me with hatred\u2014because he was still a prisoner being tortured in hell.\n\"Then the king had the Twins kill each other and bring each other back to life.\"\nWhat is it like to die? It hurts more than you can imagine because the body resists death as hard as it can, with resources you even don't know you have.\n\"The king was so impressed he had them kill himself, but the Twins didn't bring the king back to life. The other demons were so frightened that they agreed to a truce. They can send out disease and death, but they can't leave hell. And they can't have everyone to torture, only violent, worthless, guilty people.\"\n\"I suppose that made the Maya feel better about themselves.\"\nIrene notices that I haven't made her feel better. I'm not a feel-good god. She can't travel to hell and back with me and not be changed, can she? But I may be asking too much. I showed her hell and how to fight it and what it costs to fight it. Who would volunteer to suffer?\n\"This vase is part of history,\" she says. \"We're destroying our understanding of human history.\" Maybe she can help stop it\u2014stop the 'Clasts, win the war.\n\"War is part of human nature,\" Michael says with a sigh as if he were wise.\nShe sets down the pot, her mind a jumble of ideas, possibilities, and doubts. \"What will you do with this after the war?\"\n\"Maybe I'll open my own museum,\" he jokes. \"Yeah, I'll take it. The price ... They said it was expensive. What is the price?\"\nShe thinks a moment, and her mind suddenly becomes clear. \"Seventy thousand dollars.\" The real price had been twenty thousand dollars.\n\"Seventy thou!\" he says. \"Wow, I mean . . .\"\nA siren begins to sound far way. \"Religion,\" she says, \"has been responsible for endless repression and destruction. The world will be better off without it.\" She's quoting the 'Clasts now. Perhaps another church has been torched, or a mosque, a stupa, the Pantheon. \"Seventy thousand,\" she repeats firmly.\nHe sighs theatrically, having gotten the message: buy now while there's still some left. He stares at the vase. Even before the war, it would have fetched a high price. \"I'll be right back.\" He heads upstairs.\nShe looks out the window. She can't see the night sky from this angle, but she imagines the stars and me, a black jaguar, prowling among them. Where will she go? What will she do? Seventy thousand dollars won't buy a lot of weapons, she knows, but she couldn't have asked for more and gotten it. Wars are expensive, and war is hell ... She has learned something about hell. Does she really want to go there? I don't wish it for her, but we have to fight. She has my blessing.\nMichael returns promptly, carrying a large cardboard box that he sets on the table next to my vase. He opens the lid to show her stacks of bills. \"You can count it,\" he says.\n\"That's all right.\" She looks at the box, originally for medicine, and reads out loud, \"Erythromycin.\"\n\"Oh, I sell pharmaceuticals,\" he says. \"War is good for business. A lot of injuries, a lot of displacement and bad water. Big markets. I keep the prices reasonable, for the good guys, at least.\"\n\"Lots of disease.\" She has no more doubts.\n\"Exactly.\"\nShe feels like she is waiting for the sun to rise, knowing that much needs to be done first. \"Enjoy the vase. Take good care of it.\"\n\"If there's more, I'm interested.\"\n\"We'll let you know.\"\nShe picks up the box of cash, surprisingly heavy, and leaves. Music sounds faintly through the frosted windows as she walks away, an ordinary woman on her way back to the suburbs, but she doesn't belong there now and she won't stay long. Far away, a gold chalice is being filled with wine in a cabin in snowy mountains, the verses of a holy book are being recited in a remote cave, and a serene Buddha of the Promised Land is being buried in a rice paddy. Long ago Conquistadors smashed my temples, burned my books, and hung my priests. Look what good it did. She'll find allies.\nFog has moved in and will protect Irene on her journey to Walnut Creek. The fog among the skyscrapers reminds me of the rainforest of my homeland. The Transamerica building tapers self-consciously toward the sky like one of my temples\u2014a pyramid, an artificial mountain reaching toward heaven. I leap into the sky and journey toward the east and dawn.\nSue Burke was born Wisconsin and honeymooned in the Maya Yucatan. She and her husband moved to Madrid, Spain, in 1999.
