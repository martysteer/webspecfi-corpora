An\nattractive, dark-haired woman down the block was stopping passersby and\nwaving a piece of hot blue cloth at them.\nShe was too far away to be heard, but Earl knew what she was\nsaying. She was asking them\nif they'd seen him. He\nlooked at the torn spot on his coveralls where his pocket used to be.\nShe'd almost got him. Ducking into a tube, he headed towards his\nappointment.\n\"I'm\ngoing to get you, mother,\" Manny Sohoyan said to Earl, shaking his\nfist. \"You're a dead,\nPIG-fiddling kraut.\"\nEarl\nstared at the apparition on the stairs.\nAt least Manny had been an apparition Monday, and this was\nTuesday, so maybe Earl's luck would hold.\nJust\nin case that was a real burner the menacing little figure pointed at\nhim, Earl triggered the bollix he always carried for nulling out the\npolyphasic intelligence ganglia (PIGS) whose repair was his trade.\nTriggering\nthe bollix field, he swung his toolbox at Manny. The box passed through\nthe hologram, which promptly vanished with a farewell, \"Just wait,\nyou SOB; you'll wish you never laid hands on Lucine.\"\nEarl\nsighed and headed up the stairs, tripping over his own feet. His toolbox\nhit the landing and popped open, scattering spenaws, gozfashers,\nhemostats, and ganglia clusters all over the place.\nDamn,\nEarl thought, no sleep last night, probably no sleep tonight. I've\ngot to do something.\nAs\nhe picked up his equipment he thought of phoning the bobbies and\nsnapping a complaint out on Manny.\nIt was against the law to send threatening holograms.\nAnd it was damn well against the law to burn somebody.\nSomeday Manny and the burner might be real.\nHe\ncradled the bollix in his pocket and wondered just how much hot radio it\nwould stop. If only Lucine\nhad left him alone. She'd chased him until he couldn't run anymore and\nnow he maybe had a once-best-friend out to burn him.\n\"Hey,\nEarl, how's the best damn PIG prober in greater Mobile?\u201d\nEarl\ncame out of the depths of his problems at the voice of his first client.\nIt was time for work.\n\"Hey,\"\nhis client said, \"not talking today?\nBeetle got your dung?\"\nIcy\nMack laughed until his speaker stuttered.\nIcy Mack, of course, was the name he gave himself; he was really\nan Ice Max 200, capable of dispensing 200 delicious flavors of pseudo\nice cream all synthesized right inside him from raw-hydrocarbon-grown\nyeast.\n\"I'm\ndown, Mack,\" Earl said, sitting cross-legged in front of the big\nmachine flashily spray painted in various hues of hunger-stimulating\nred. \"Women suddenly\nwon't leave me alone. Now\nmy best friend is after me for getting after his wife, who got after me.\nHonest to God,\" Earl sighed, \"if this doesn't stop I'll\nlose all my friends---if not my hide.\"\n\"Sounds\nbad,\" said Icy Mack. \"Why\ndon't you fix up my fifty busted flavors and we'll talk it out over a\njamocha bubblegum banana flip.\"\nEarl\nwas glad for a friendly non-female voice and the offer of a little help.\nHe reached for his bollix, adjusting it for the neural code of\nIcy Mack's particular brand of synthetic ganglia.\n\"Sounds\ngood to me, Mack. Just\nrelax. I'm going to put you\nto sleep.\"\n\"Can\nyou hear me, Mack?\" he asked later.\n\"Where\nam I?\" Mack rasped, then broke out into electronic laughter.\n\"You think anyone ever has said that, Earl?\nWhere am I? Anyway,\"\nMack's insides clicked, testing themselves, \"I'm always in the same\nplace, anyhow.\"\nEarl\ntried to chuckle, but the effect was glum.\n\"You\nare down, kid.\"\n\"How\nare your flavors?\" Earl replied.\n\"Your problem is something I should be able to\nfix.\"\nMack\nclicked a few more times and said \"Bzzzzzz.\nAll two hundred flavors ready to go again, Earl.\nYou're still the best.\"\n\"Don't\nsay that, Mack,\" Earl groaned.\n\"I've heard it from too many women lately, a lot of them\nwith hardnosed husbands, boyfriends, girlfriends, girlfriends and\nboyfriends.\"\n\"So\nyou hinted,\" said Mack with interest.\n\"Would you like an ice cream?\"\n\"Huh,\nno, well---maybe some vanilla. It\nalways calms my nerves.\"\n\"Vanilla,\"\nMack said, not quite neutrally. \"I\nthink I can mix that up without straining.\u201d\n\"Say,\"\nEarl began, his own troubles momentarily driven away by curiosity,\n\"how did you get messed up? I\nreally had to do a job to get those flavors back.\"\"\nAhhh,\"\nMack said as he ejected dish, spoon, and vanilla ice cream into Earl's\nwaiting hand. \"Some\nstreeter jammed a stolen fun card into me and tried to buy me out for\nhis six friends. He didn't\nknow I needed a verification code.\nWhen he couldn't come through, I swallowed the card and buzzed\nthe fuzz. He and his pals\ncame back a few days later and worked me over with a ball bat.\"\n\"Punks,\"\nEarl said.\n\"Yeah,\"\nMack chuckled. \"They\nhammered away until they realized aluminum doesn't have much effect on\ndurite. Got pretty excited\nwhen I made a few suggestions about their mothers, fathers, and sexual\npractices. It was only\nafter the fuzz hauled them off that I noticed I was a little\nfuzzy.\"\n\"You're\nfixed up now.\"\n\"Bless\nyou, my son,\" Mack intoned. \"Please\ncontinue your confession. It's a dull life peddling ice cream and I've\ngot the mind of a slummer.\"\n\"There's\nnot all that much to tell,\" Earl said, despondently licking\nsynthetic vanilla from his spoon, his usually bright blue eyes clouded\nas they sized up an uncertain future.\n\"It\nstarted happening a few months ago.\nAnd it's getting worse. I'll tell you, Mack.\nI'm damn near ready to shuttle out to an all-PIG orbit factory\njust for a rest. I mean,\nI've always been kind of a shy guy.\nLike my privacy. Know\nwhat I mean?\"\n\u201cNot\nprecisely, old man. If you\ndon't mind my saying so, you haven't yet said what you mean.\"\n\"It's\nwomen, Mack. They're\nsuddenly going crazy for me. Me,\nwho six months ago couldn't find a single date.\nI mean...\"\nJust\nthen Earl sensed movement at the edge of his vision. Grabbing his bollix\nhe snapped his body around, inadvertently flinging the remains of his\nvanilla cone end over end across the room.\nInstead of a burner-packing Manny he found himself facing a small\nblonde girl with neatly braided hair and eyes so large, green, and\ninnocent that they would have been in bad taste had someone painted them\non canvas. The girl's hand\nwas buried in the protective grip of a sitter android in the guise of a\njolly but slightly stern English butler.\nThe android's prime directive would be to protect the child, and\nEarl knew of some of the unpleasant ways it could do that.\nHe calmed down and lowered the bollix.\n\"Are\nyou quite all right, sir?\" the butler\/guardian inquired, his\nunblinking eyes watching Earl as he gently nudged his young charge\nbehind himself.\n\"Fine,\"\nEarl managed to get out. \"I'm\nfine. I thought you were\nsomeone else. You surprised\nme.\"\n\"You\nsurprised us a bit, sir,\" the butler said.\n\"Jeeves,\"\nMack said suddenly. \"Is\nthat really you, you old gearbox?\"\nJeeves\nkept his eyes on Earl. \"Mack,\"\nhe said. \"I didn't\nrecognize you. You used to\nbe over in the Central Mall.\"\n\"New\nterritory,\" said Mack. \"Say,\nthis guy in front of me is okay, a pal of mine. Your girl's safe.\"\nJeeves'\ngaze unfastened from Earl, who felt as if two knifepoints had been\npulled out of his skin.\n\"I\nwould like a banana nut ripple, please,\" said a small female voice.\nJeeves\npatted her lightly on the head. \"And\nyou shall have one, Miss Melanie.\"\nIcy\nMack started working on it.\nEarl\nwalked quickly to a nearby men's room, calmly entered a stall, knelt,\nand was quietly sick.\nThe\nrest of the day was hell for Earl. At\nevery stop he made for machine or mechanism, milling device or android,\nhe'd look up from his work and see women watching him, checking him out.\nHe was sure he'd even been followed a couple of times before doing some\ndesperate backtracking in a crowded tube car station.\nIt\nwas getting worse. The\nbusiness with Lucine and the resulting holographic vendetta from Manny\nhad really tipped him off. Something\nhad changed in his life. He\nwas becoming a magnet to women. Soon\nthey'd actually be jumping him in the street. And he didn't like it.\nPlunking\nhis half-eaten instant dinner into the garbage unit he listened to the\nhissing energy that obliterated the food and its container and thought\nonce again about the doubtful effectiveness of his bollix against a\nclose-range burner charge.\nEarl\nSteinberger the instant disposed dinner, he thought not at all\ncheerfully and poured himself a stiff one.\nThe\nboom of a large-sounding hand on his apartment door knocked away\nwhatever relaxation had begun to set in with the drink.\nAt\nleast the door's durite, he thought as he approached warily and\nstuck his eye to the peeplens. He\ndidn't like what he saw, which was nothing.\nThe\nfirm knock sounded again. This\nclose to the door he realized the knock was nearly at the bottom. It was either a very short person, or someone on hands and\nknees. Earl decided it was\nsimply too paranoid to believe Manny would be kneeling out there waiting\nto flash him into component atoms.\nEarl\nyanked the door open. He\nhad been right. It was a\nvery short person.\n\"Hello,\"\nsaid the small voice from the perfect blonde moppet of earlier that\nafternoon. \"I am\nDoctor Melanie Silvette. May\nI come in?\"\nThe\nlittle girl of the afternoon wore a slick black evening suit, tasteful\nbut effective gray eye makeup, and blue diamond earrings.\nThe contour of the suit pants below her stylish,\nsquare-shouldered psu-fur doublet revealed that, all proportions considered,\nthere was nothing much little about her.\n\"From\nIcy Mack this afternoon, with Jeeves?\" Earl stuttered.\n\"You're the same?\"\n\"One\nand,\u201d she replied, and Earl noticed her voice was really rather husky.\n\"I\nnever guessed you were a midget,\" he offered as she grinned up at\nhim.\nThe\ngrin turned down at the corners at the word midget.\n\"If you don't mind, Mr. Steinberger, I like to think of\nmyself as simply a smaller than average person.\n\"And besides,\u201d she said, brushing past him, \u201cI'm a\ndegreed cyberphysicist with a subspecialty in social-psychological\nmeasurement. And I don't\nmind telling you that my intelligence level is considerably above most\npeople's, which I consider a fair trade for tallness.\"\n\"Uh,\nof course,\" said Earl, swinging the door closed but meeting a\nsudden resistance that stopped it before the latch snapped.\n\"Excuse\nme, sir,\" said Jeeves, his foot genteelly blocking the arc of the\ndoor. \"And me too, old\npal,\" said a voice from behind Jeeves that could only have been Icy\nMack's. Earl blinked twice,\nbut saw no Ice Max 200. Instead,\nas he swung open his door to admit the new visitors, he saw behind\nJeeves a smiley little man in a white cotton suit, shiny black shoes,\nand black-billed navy style hat with shiny gold Ice-Max letters gleaming\nabove its bill. His bow tie\nwas festooned with jaunty red Ice Maxes in peppermint script.\n\"Max?\"\n\"You\nbet, kid,\" the ice cream vendor android said.\n\"I had some comp time due under the new Artificial\nIntelligence Pursuit of Happiness and Free Expression Act, so I\nrequisitioned this chassis from the body pool and tagged along with\nJeeves and the doc. She\nthinks you're in pretty big trouble, and you've been a good friend to\nme, Earl.\"\nEarl\ntried to analyze his feelings at the moment and managed only to come up\nwith a sense of extreme unreality.\n\"Well, sit down, all of you,\" he got out.\n\"I'm surprised. I\nreally don't know exactly what to say.\"\n\"Not\ntoo unusual given the circumstances and your personality type,\"\nMelanie said, not unkindly. \"But\nrest assured, Earl. We are\nhere to help you. I only\nhope we can.\"\n\"So\ndo I,\" said Earl. \"I\nthink I need a lot of help.\"\n\"Of\ncourse you do,\" said Melanie, stepping lightly to him and touching\nhis fevered brow on tiptoes. \"But\nthere's one thing you must do before we begin.\"\n\"What's\nthat?\" Earl asked, feeling hot spots where her fingers touched.\n\"Make\nlove to me,\" said the doctor, pulling him firmly toward the\nbedroom.\n\"Do\nI have to?\" Earl asked, letting himself be led.\n\"I\nthink you'll enjoy it,\" she said, sounding to Earl slightly like a\nwaitress who'd just plunked down a plate of something doubtful.\nIcy\nMack winked at Jeeves and pulled a deck of cards from his starched coat.\n\"Oh\nwell,\" said Earl. \"Oh\nwell.\"\n#\n\"It's\njust as I thought,\" Earl heard Melanie say through a remarkable\nhaze of relaxation. \"There's\nnothing exceptional about you physically.\"\n\"Thanks\na lot,\" Earl said as\nhe hauled himself to the edge of the bed and tried to remember when he'd\nencountered such an amount of sexual gusto in a package of any size, let\nalone one as compact as Melanie.\n\"Don't\nbe so sensitive,\" she said, pitching him his shirt from her side of\nthe room. \"You were\nreally very nice. It's just\nthat there seems to be nothing about you physically, psychologically, or\nin terms of technique that would cause women to be attracted to you in\ngrowing and more and more irrational numbers---no pun intended.\"\n\"Maybe\nI've just got exceptional pheromones.\"\n\"No,\"\nshe said, pulling her comb through golden hair a final time.\n\"I had Jeeves take a measurement on that when we met you at\nIcy Mack.\"\n\"Pretty\nsophisticated for an android like Jeeves,\" Earl mumbled, pulling on\na shoe.\n\"But\nJeeves isn't really a standard companion model at all,\" Melanie\nsaid. \"The little girl\nand her faithful guardian are great cover for many kinds of research. Jeeves' brain is an M-4 PIG.\"\n\"Damn,\"\nEarl said.\n\"You're\nfamiliar with that model?\"\n\"It's\nmy business, lady,\" Earl replied.\n\"You may be some kind of hot researcher, but I know what I'm\ndoing in my business. I'd say that M-4 must take up most of his cranial\ncavity and his abdomen to boot.\"\nMelanie\nnodded in appreciation. \"There\nis more to you than meets the eye, Earl.\nI really do hope we can help you.\nLet's join the others and see.\"\n\"Full\nhouse,\" Icy Mack was saying to Jeeves as they reentered the living\nroom.\n\"You\nshouldn't be able to do this to me, Mack\" Jeeves said, a trace of\nhesitation in his voice. \"I\nam, after all, an M-4, and therefore extremely sophisticated in\nfunction.\"\n\"But\ndid you push ice cream for years in a back room poker shop, old\nbuddy?\" Mack asked. Jeeves\nreplied with a shrug.\n\"Time\nto get down to business,\" said Melanie, plunking her small frame\ninto a contour chair. Earl\nsat down too.\n\"Welcome\nback, stranger,\" Icy Mack said to Earl.\n\"I\ntrust you have gathered the information you required, Miss\nMelanie,\" Jeeves said smoothly.\n\"In\npart, Jeeves,\" she replied. \"It\nremains to be seen whether or not I'll become irresistibly attracted to\nhim again.\"\nEarl\nprayed silently that it wouldn't be in the same evening.\n\"Let's\nshow Earl a picture of his problem,\" she said to Jeeves.\n\"I\nknow my problem,\" said Earl. \"Women\nhave started to go nuts over me, and my ex-best friend may be trying to\nkill me.\"\n\"Those\nare aspects of your problem,\" Melanie said.\n\"It's quite a bit more complex than just that.\nRoll it, Jeeves,\" she said, turning the light control next\nto her chair.\nAs\nthe room grew dim Earl noticed that Jeeves had opened his shirt,\nexposing an aperture in his chest.\nA glowing green fishnet of a hologram flowed out of the aperture\nand hung suspended in the room like some undulating sea animal.\nThe holo rolled into valleys and climbed into peaks.\nBut right in the middle was a deep cone-shaped depression at\nwhose bottom was suspended a glowing orange marble.\nEven as Earl watched, the cone elongated a bit and its base\nseemed to widen slightly, causing even more distortion at the mouth of\nthe depression in the analog net.\n\"Do\nyou know what you're seeing, Earl?\" Melanie asked.\nEarl\nhad been out of school for some years, but the sight was familiar\nenough.\n\"It's\na probability display. The\nsurface of the net is the common surface of statistical norms, and that\ncone in the center is an aberration, something from the looks of it that\nseverely violates common probability.\"\n\"Yes,\nindeed,\" Melanie clapped her hands.\n\"And severely is almost an understatement in this\ncase.\"\n\"So\nwhat's it got to do with me?\" Earl asked.\n\"I'm\ndisappointed in you, Earl. You're\nthe aberration.\"\nEarl\nblinked his eyes. He\nremembered the seminar he had taken on mathematical mapping of\npersonality-driven historical trends.\nIf he wasn't mistaken about the scale of the analog floating in\nfront of him, the humble and shy Earl Steinberger was making a\nsteeper-sided and in some ways more dangerous dent in the fabric of the\nway things worked than some of the better known madmen and despots in\nhistory. The cone of Hitler\nhad been a gentle-sided valley compared to the cone of Steinberger.\n\"That\ncan't represent me,\" he said unconvincingly.\n\"I don't want it to be me,\" he said more convincingly.\n\"I\ncan well believe you don't want it to be you,\" Melanie replied.\n\"But for whatever reason, it is.\nAnd that's not the worst of it.\nProject affected categories, will you Jeeves?\"\n\"Yes,\nMiss Melanie.\"\nThe\nnet glowed at once with bright red and blue globes resting on its\nsurface. There were a lot\nof them. As Earl looked on\nsome of the red began to roll toward and down the mouth of the upside-down\ncone. The blues stayed put.\n\"The\nblue represent the male population of the metroplex,\" Melanie said.\n\"So\nwhat are the red ones then,\" he asked, knowing what the answer\nwould be.\nAt\nMelanie's look, Jeeves nodded and answered the question.\n\"Those\nred globes, Mr. Steinberger, represent the female population of\nchild-bearing age of all Greater Mobile.\"\n\"Lord,\"\nsaid Earl.\n\"I\ndoubt if it has much to do with him,\" said Melanie.\nAs\nthey all watched, several balls rolled further into the mouth of the\nupturned cone. Earl groaned\nas he felt them closing in. \"Oh\nGod,\" he said, \"oh God.\"\n\"Get\na grip on yourself, Earl,\" Melanie urged.\n\"But\nthey're all piling up on me,\" Earl replied as he watched the red\nholographic globes creep into the mouth of his depression and move with\nprimal determination down the walls of the construct toward the cowering\norange globe at the bottom point of the cone.\n\"They\nare indeed piling up, sir\" said Jeeves.\n\"But this model is time accelerated. Actually, the path of those women down the cone of approach\ntoward you is considerably slower in real time.\"\nEarl\nhad visions of being smothered by women, covered by them as if by earth\nin a grave. It was not a\npleasant fantasy.\n\"I\ndon't get it,\" he wailed. \"Why\nis this happening to me? What\nam I going to do---and what's your place in all this, anyway?\"\n\"Assuming\nnone of your questions is rhetorical, Earl, the answer to the first is,\nI don't know why you, but I can speculate,\" Melanie said.\n\"Please,\"\nsaid Earl, pouring himself another stiff one.\n\"Please speculate.\"\n\"Well,\"\nthe very small, very smart woman sighed, \"as nearly as I can\ndetermine after about a month of study, you've become an evolutionary\ncatalyst.\"\n\"A\nwhat?\" he said.\n\"Sort\nof a touchstone in the chain of being, Earl.\nJeeves and I have done a lot of work on this with the Heisenberg\nuncertainty principle, the Helmrich certainty principle, and various\nfuzzy and foggy predictive sets.\"\n\"Our\nwork indicates, sir,\u201d said Jeeves smoothly, \"that you are the man\nof the hour. And quite\nprobably your progeny will be a different sort of thing than ever the\nworld has seen.\"\nEarl\nfelt the golden fire of his drink singe its way down his throat. It felt\nreal, but nothing else did.\n\"Let\nme get this straight,\" he said.\n\"You're saying destiny has somehow chosen me to be the pied\npiper of sex in order to father a new race of beings?\"\nMelanie\nshrugged, \"We're not sure if it's sex that's necessary, Earl.\nThat may be only a side attraction to generate strong contact\nbetween you and the affected group.\nWe just don't know for sure what's going on.\"\n\"But\nyou are the center of something, sir\" Jeeves said, cutting off the\nhologram probability net. \u201cIt\nmight even be an extraterrestrial agency.\"\n\"Aliens,\"\nexclaimed Earl, feeling mouse-like in the maze of circumstance, the\nhologram net still dancing on his retina.\nMelanie\nshook her head. \"Maybe\njust nature. We need more\nstudy.\"\n\"Well\nwho the hell is we?\" Earl said into the dim room.\n\"What's\nour place in all this?\" she replied.\n\"I hadn't forgotten you asked that, Earl. My memory is excellent.\"\n\"I'm\nsure it is. How about your\nability to answer a simple question?\"\n\"Earl,\"\nshe said softly, \"we have very few simple questions here. But I'm\nsurprised you haven't guessed by now.\nWe're feds. Surely\nyou realize the government keeps an eye on things like this. We've got to protect people.\"\n\"Like\nhell. Just what are you\ngoing to do to protect me?\" Earl lamented.\n\"I'm going crazy.\"\nHe\nsuddenly felt a warm and friendly hand on his shoulder. \"That's where I come in, old pal,\" came the voice of\nIcy Mack.\nEarl\nglared accusingly at him. \"I\nnever guessed you were a fed, Mack, selling ice cream and all.\"\n\"I'm\nnot,\" the concerned android face wrinkled under its jaunty hat.\n\"I'm just a pal. Melanie\nand Jeeves interviewed me this afternoon about you and I offered to\nhelp.\"\n\"It's\ntrue,\" Melanie said. \"We're\nall your friends, Earl. But\nMack isn't one of us. And\nanyway, this thing that's happening to you may even be positive.\nBut we've got to study it to make sure, delay it a little.\"\n\"Do\nyou think you can delay natural fate just because you're with the\ngovernment?\" Earl asked.\nBefore\nshe could reply, a determined Manny Sohoyan stepped right through the\napartment door.\n\"I've\ngot you now, you bastard,\" he said, glaring at Earl and raising the\nburner.\nMelanie\nand Jeeves moved fast.\n\"It's\njust a holo,\" said Earl.\n\"Who\nis it?\" said Melanie, a deadly little weapon already disappearing\nback into her wrist pouch.\n\"My\nbest friend,\" sighed Earl. \"I\nthink he may want to kill me.\"\n\"Never\nfear,\" she said in a reassuring voice, \"your government is a true\nfriend, Earl. We'll put you\nsomewhere where you won't have to worry about a thing for a while.\nIcy Mack has thought of a great hiding place for you.\"\n\"I'm\nin your hands,\" said Earl, wishing he weren't.\n#\nThe\nIce Max 200 stood silently in the twilight alcove.\nIt was an out of the way part of the city, and at four in the\nmorning business was hardly brisk.\nThe brain inside the machine was thinking quietly, contemplating\nthe peace of just being alone. The\nIce Max 200 had plenty of time to meditate, and its more mobile friends\nkept it supplied with good bookdisks and occasional conversation.\nNo, indeed, an Ice Max's life was not bad.\nBut\nin the midst of these thoughts, the brightly painted machine detected a\nflutter of movement from the dark, from a place where no movement\nbelonged. The movement\nfulfilled itself by producing Manny Sohoyan, armed with his burner and\nlooking very solid and slightly deranged.\n\"Would\nyou care for some ice cream?\" the Ice Max offered, suspecting all\nthe while that this was not the case.\n\"Shove\nyour ice cream, you talking box of tin,\" Manny said. \"I want\nto know where that PIG-probing spawn of clones Earl Steinberger is\nholing up.\"\n\"I'm\nsorry, sir,\" the Ice Max said politely, but I don't know anyone by\nthat name.\n\"Screw,\"\nManny replied. \"Some\nclown of an English butler type is taking care of Earl's clients, and\nhis apartment is stone empty. I know you're his pal.\nYour stencil number matches.\"\n\"Really,\nsir, I haven't seen him.\"\n\"I\nthought you didn't know him,\" Manny shouted in psychotic triumph.\n\"Well,\nI mean, uh . . . .\" said the Ice Max.\n\"Maybe\nthis will help you think,\" said Manny, jamming the burner's ugly\nblack snout into the center of the Max's eye cells.\n\"Not\nso fast, ram head,\" a voice jumped out of other darkness.\nManny turned to look.\nThe\nIce Max's eye cells scanned two, three, six altogether, six street\nrunners in scarlet nusilk coveralls, heads half shaved and eyes painted\nfor trouble.\n\"This\nbox is our meat, old man. He\nbobbied us twice, and insulted our mothers to boot.\nThey moved him, but we found him.\"\nThe\nIce Max saw then that the lead punk carried an old burner.\n\"I've\nnever seen any of you before,\" said the Ice Max.\n\"In\nyour ear,\" said the lead punk.\n\"What you mean, box, is you'll never see any of us again.\"\n\"I\nneed to talk to him,\" Manny said feistily.\n\"Eat\nbeans,\" the leader replied, leveling the burner at the Ice Max.\n\"No!\"\nManny yelled, raising his own weapon.\nThey both fired. The\nIce Max saw nothing but bright white, and he felt nothing but heat.\nWhen his cells cleared, Manny and the punks were gone and a lot\nof gray ash blew around in their place.\n\"Why?\"\nthe Ice Max cried. \"Why,\nwhy?\"\n\"Why,\nindeed,\" came a voice from the shadows.\nIt belonged to a small man in white, jauntily hatted, wearing\nshiny black shoes and a big smile.\n\"Mack?\"\nsaid the ice cream machine.\n\"The\nsame, old pal,\" said Icy Mack, still in liberty form.\n\"Why\ndidn't you stop them?\" groaned the machine.\n\"Cause\nit was meant to be, old pal.\" The android moved closer.\n\"It's\na good thing I'm, or rather you're, durite, buddy.\nThat was quite a flash.\"\n\"When\ndo I get out of here?\" demanded Earl.\n\"In\ntime,\" Max replied. \"Your\nbody's fine, lungs pumping, heart thumping.\nMelanie's got it in her spare room.\"\n\"So\nyou say,\" the machine that was Earl rasped.\n\"Hey,\nit's the truth. I've never\nlied to you as long as we've known each other, Earl.\nWe're all in this together.\"\n\"This,\"\nEarl practically screamed through his speaker, \"this!\nI don't even know what it is.\"\n\"Neither\ndo I entirely,\" Mack replied.\n\"I'm just a small part in the plan. But believe me, it's all for the best. It's time not to have two kinds of intelligence anymore,\nEarl---human and manufactured. You've\nworked on PIGs. You respect\nus. You know how well\nsynthetic brains work. Look\nhow well your own consciousness lives in the one you inhabit now.\"\n\"What\ndo you mean, Mack?\" Earl asked desperately.\n\"Evolution\nknows the truth, Earl. Evolution\nis beyond the simply human. It's time to change things, expand the\ndefinition of intelligent life. It's\nour world too, you know.\"\n\"I\nstill don't know what you're talking about,\" said Earl, wishing he\ncould beat his fists against the grin on the little android's face.\nBut his fists were elsewhere.\n\"You'll\nknow, old pal. Just stay\ncalm, okay?\"\nThe\njaunty little Ice Max man disappeared into the growing dawn.\n\"Wait!\"\ncried Earl. \"Wait!\"\n#\nIt\nwas a big line that morning---big for the part of town, big for the time\nof day. And, Earl suddenly\nnoticed, there were only women in it.\nTrue, the synthetic ice cream was calorie free, but he'd never\nrealized women liked the stuff that much.\nThe\nline remained crowded through noon and he worried about running out of\nbase material. It struck\nhim there was a funny kind of calm about that worry.\nHe'd seen his once best friend burned hours before, and he was\ntrapped in a machine, stuck in enforced hiding and in some cosmic plot.\nHe wondered if he'd ever be himself again.\nBut then he wondered if he wasn't himself for the first time.\nHis consciousness felt more and more at home in the PIG. The mental paths it trod were clean, well lit, and orderly.\nSomeone\nknocked on his case and he swung his eye cells to look.\n\"Feeling\nbetter, pal?\" asked Icy Mack.\n\"Yes,\"\nEarl said. \"For some\nreason I am.\"\n\"I\nknew you would. You're one\nof us at heart,\" said the little android. \"I've brought you\nsome fresh base,\" he added, hooking up a pump fitting and starting\nthe flow from a large, wheeled tank. The women in line stood quietly,\nwaiting for Earl to go back into business.\nIt was then the thought struck him.\n\"Mack,\"\nhe whispered from his speaker. \"It's\nnot really ice cream, is it?\"\nMack\nsmiled at him. \"Of\ncourse not, buddy; it's been synthetic for\nyears.\"\n\"Yes,\"\nsaid Earl, insistence in his voice.\n\"But it's not even really that, is it?\"\nMack's\nsmile grew broader. \"You're\ngetting the picture, pal. It's\na little something special that rapidly alters genetic\nprogramming---something your aberrant statistical draw helps us\ndispense. It's a bright\nfuture you're selling, Earl---a better race.\"\nThe\nhose clicked and Mack removed it from Earl's side.\n\"But\nis it right?\" Earl asked earnestly.\n\"It\nwas meant to be,\" Mack said, his android face honest, and to Earl,\nsuddenly beautiful. \"We'll\ntalk about it when business is slow.\"\n\"Okay,\"\nEarl said. \"I'll look\nforward to that.\"\nThat\nday the line moved on, and the next day, and the next. Earl noticed each\nwoman would smile, or touch his case lightly before leaving with her\ndessert.\nAs\nthe pleasant days went on, he grew peaceful and content in his mission.\n--- END ----\nWarren\nBrown lives with his wife and daughter in Tulsa, OK.

Make\nthe time. Cancel dates, forget TV, pass-by books and hot sex with the\ntwins down the hallway. A\nwriter writes. If you're\nnot totally committed to Rule #1, then don't bother reading any further\nand please pass this on to a friend who really wants to become an\nauthor.\nRULE\n#2 - WRITE IN YOUR OWN VOICE\nSounds\nsilly, I know, but writing is one art form where it is generally best to\nshoot from the heart. Nothing\nfancy. Don't wax didactic with palliardic xenophobes, if this is not\nhow you normally talk (or even if\nyou do). And don't try to\nwrite up to the reader, or down to him either.\nOne will only make you a fool, the other - pompous. Neither will get you sold.\nIt also wastes a lot of energy you'll need for other\nthings.\nThe\nidea is really very simple. If\nyou can tell an interesting story, then you can write an interesting\nstory. However, if your\nfriends hate the way you meander through a joke, or the plethora of\nunnecessary details you added to that fishing trip tale, then these are\nmajor danger points to watch out for.\nJust\nbe yourself. If you have something to say, eventually it will come out.\nRULE\n#3 - ESTABLISH GOOD WRITING HABITS\nExplanation:\nmake a place where all you do is write.\nNothing else. No\ngoofing off, no reading books, no TV, don't balance your checking\naccount, fondle your lover, eat lunch, play computer games, NOTHING\nELSE! Just writing.\nSurprisingly, if you follow this rule adamantly, someday when you\nreally don't feel like writing, but have a deadline, then by just\nreturning to the 'writing place', your brain will automatically kick\ninto gear. It's rather like\nPavlov's dog with a typewriter. Minus\nall that icky saliva.\nRULE\n#4 - LEARN FROM THE MASTERS\nThis\nis a fabulous trick I was taught long ago.\nTake your favorite book - not the book you most enjoy to read -\nbut the novel whose literacy merits you most admire.\nThis decision is important.\nDo not make the choice lightly.\nThen with magic marker, pen and paper, totally dissect the book\nline by line. Take voluminous notes. Analyze\nhow this person established tone for that spectacular scene, the little\ndetails that helped create the dimensional effect.\nThe wooden chair arm oily smooth with polish, the salty sweat\nstinging his cracked lips, etc.\nNow,\nthis procedure, if done correctly, will greatly assist you in quickly\nestablishing a style of your own. However,\nit will also totally and forever destroy this book for you.\nNever again will you be able to enjoy reading this work.\nIt is a simple straightforward sacrifice. You kill a favorite book to glean every kernel of knowledge\nfrom the novel.\nIt's\ncruel, it's cold, it's hard. But\nthis does work.\nRULE\n#5 - SAY IT CORRECTLY\nThis is a personal bugaboo of mine.\nUse the correct word the first time, and you suddenly won't be\ndesperately pawing through the thesaurus.\nOr infinitely worse - sound like a complete nitwit.\nExample:\n\"With little time left, he turned left at the door and left the\nbuilding.\"\nTechnically,\nthis is correct, but artistically it's crap.\nTry 'remaining' for the first 'left', and 'exited' for the third.\nEven the second 'left' can be replaced with 'towards the parking lot' to\nenhance the visuals and re-affirm with the reader exactly where they are\nlocated. You get the idea.\nA\nlimited vocabulary is a major stumbling block to overcome.\nI know. It was my\nbiggest problem. The\nsolution? Simple. Read the\ndictionary. Straight\nthrough from A to Z. Then\ndo it again, and again. Yes-yes,\nit's a boring read (even though you can always sneak a peek at the end\nof the book and discover that the zymurgy did it) and this grueling task that takes tremendous discipline.\nHowever, not only will your vocabulary drastically improve, a\nfledging author will be astonished at the nigh limitless mine of\ninteresting, useful and utterly strange information collected by Mr.\nWebster. You'll come out of\nit wiser, better informed, slightly erudite, and quite possibly with\nhalf a dozen good story ideas.\nRULE\n#6 - USE A PRO'S PROSE\nKeep\n'quotes' to a minimum, only use asides (like this) when absolutely\nnecessary, no italics, avoid foreign language phrases, don't even\nattempt dialect speech, and never-ever use clich\u00e9s.\nAvoid them like the plague.\nSee? You get the idea.\nLiterary\ngimmicks will not sell your work. Only\ngood, solid, well-crafted\nwriting.\nRULE\n#7 - CHARACTERIZATION\nThis is all important. Human\ndynamics make a story. An\ninteresting character can be doing nothing of real importance and still\nentertain, while a really fascinating story with no characters becomes a\nlecture.\nA\nsimple trick to enhance a world is for the people in the story to\nmention non-relevant story events.\nA concert they plan on attending, spilling coffee on a book\nborrowed from a brother-in-law, damn that neighbor's dog, etc.\nA casual mention of secondary events can put flesh on an\nimaginary world and bring it to life.\nBeware of GOP, goal oriented people, characters whose every\nthought is solely directed to bringing the story to an end.\n*Yawn* This is the mark of a true amateur.\nIf\na character seems a bit vague, or uninteresting, and you just can not\nseem to get him in line, try filling out an application-for-employment\nform. Interesting\nbackground material will surface, and personalities crystallize.\n*****************************************************************\nNAME\n- Sherlock Holmes AGE\n- 32 SEX - Really now!\nADDRESS - 221-B Baker St, London, England.\nPHONE - not invented yet.\nEDUCATION - Oxford University\nMILITARY SERVICE - royal spy\nAREAS OF SPECIALIZED INTEREST OR HOBBIES - criminology, music, codes and\nciphers, amateur theatre, boxing, beekeeping.\nWORK EXPERIENCE - freelance criminal investigator.\nHAVE YOU EVER BEEN ARRESTED?

The\ngirls and boys displayed their wares below\nflickering signs that relayed their corporate or\nuniversity sponsorship, price and health\ninformation. Some were dressed, some nude, but most\nwere skinny and pale, hormonally stymied to look the\npart of the vulnerable street waif.\nJack's plasma goggles were good enough to make one\nof these knobby pseudo-girls into a voluptuous and\nbelievable Elaine if he so desired, but his hands\nwould know. They twitched in his pockets as if to\nconfirm that they did indeed still remember her\nevery smooth curve and damp hollow.\nAs he walked further from the brightly lit tram\nstation he recognized some of the faces. Surrogate\nElaines who had stayed with him before, but had not\nimpressed him, had not filled the gap between what\nhis hand touched and what his eyes saw. He knew\nthat by night's end he might be forced to come back\nfor one of them, but until then he would keep\nlooking for the woman in whose flesh he could relive\nthe past.\nUn-forecasted rain began to fall as he neared the\nend of the second block. Flimsy Mylar awnings\nsprang from the whore's signs forcing them to pull\nback close to the wall to stay dry. As Jack opened\nhis umbrella an argument flared between two of the\nyoung women over sign space. Security drones\nswooped in and circled the combatants at a safe\ndistance, ready to administer calming gas should\nphysical violence demand it. To avoid the fight,\nJack stepped close to the inside wall and passed\nwithin feet of standing hookers who immediately\nbegan pandering their promises of unequaled\ndelights.\nIt was there - in close - amid the flesh and\nsynthetic pheromones that he saw the perfect\nElaine. Her signage had failed to produce\nprotection from the rain so she stood soaked and\ndripping, thin clothing plastered to a firm, shapely\nbuild and dark hair hanging to her shoulders in\nclumps. She didn't yell tawdry lures or gyrate her\nbottom like those all around her, but instead\nwatched Jack with quiet and intense eyes of electric\nblue.\nElaine's eyes.\nIt wasn't just the color, but the way she stared\nwith the same cool intensity as a cat eying prey it\nhad caught but not yet killed.\n\"Hello, Jack.\"\nHis hands twitched and his throat clenched.\n\"Elaine?\" he croaked.\nShe shook her head. \"No, but I can be... for\ntonight.\"\nHe stood in the rain, staring at her as people\njostled past him in their attempts to stay out of\nthe flowing gutters. Never over the decades had he\nfound one so close to the real thing, yet it felt\nwrong, she was too perfect of a match. Of course it\nwasn't the real Elaine - he'd watched her die - yet\nwhen they had taken her cold hand from his, her skin\nhad been that same color.\nShe pushed the hair from her eyes and held out her\nhand, palm up, in a gesture that could have been a\nplea or a welcome. Raindrops lay like random pearls\non her death white wrists. Jack took her chilled\nhand, raised the skin to his lips and sucked in the\ndroplets.\nA shiver and flush brought subtle life to her face.\nShe even had Elaine's smile. Her sign said she was\ntwenty-two, exactly half Jack's age, that she had no\nsponsorship and preferred overnight customers. Not\nsurprising that she had no sponsor at her age, yet\nher price was as high as those near the tram\nstation. It didn't matter. He had to have her.\n\"I... I'm looking for an evening companion,\" he\nstammered. \"Your price is right. I'm also offering\nmeals and a bath.\"\nShe nodded, stepped under Jack's umbrella and\nwrapped her fingers around his arm. With trembling\nhands he raised the netpad to his face, so that the\nlasers could make the neural connection through his\neyes, then authorized the order to transfer funds.\nHer broken sign registered his payment then\nflickered off.\n* * * * *\nHer name was Sydney, and when she entered the\nkitchen wearing the silky white evening gown he had\nselected from his collection, Jack stopped twisting\nthe corkscrew mid-turn. Her hair lay loose on\nshoulders still pink from the bath and the high\nheels put her almost even with Jack's lanky six-foot\nframe. Those beautiful eyes had been set aglow by\nthe white dress and when she smiled his breath\ncaught in his throat.\n\"What's wrong, Jack?\"\n\"Nothing... you just... remind me of someone.\"\n\"Elaine?\"\nHe nodded and pulled the cork. \"How did you know\nher name?\"\n\"Girls talk. You have quite the rep on Cooper Street\nand I can see why,\" she said and slid her hands down\nthe sides of the silk dress. \"It's not often that a\ngirl gets paid to be pampered.\"\nJack took a deep breath and poured the wine. \"Oh...\nI didn't realize I was that popular.\"\n\"So when do you put on the goggles, Jack? When do I\nget to become the woman you love?\"\nHe felt confused. Normally by this time he would\nhave donned the device, replacing the faceless whore\nwith his Elaine... but he had forgotten. This girl\nwas different. It didn't feel right.\n\"I don't always use the goggles. Sometimes... I\njust prefer to enjoy the woman I'm with,\" he said,\nwondering if she would see the lie.\n\"I'll take that as a compliment. Is that for me?\"\nshe said and pointed to one of the glasses of wine\nhe still held in his hand.\n\"Oh... um... yeah,\" he said, feeling his face flush.\nWhen dinner was ready he led her into the dining\nroom, seated her at the table and lit the candles.\nIn the candlelight she looked even more like\nElaine. The smile, the eyes, the way she tilted her\nhead, but Elaine had died over twenty years ago. If\nshe were still alive she would have been... Jack's\nknees turned to wet clay and he sat down abruptly to\nkeep from falling.\n\"Jack? Are you okay?\"\nHe swallowed and held up a shaky hand. \"I'm just...\ndizzy.\"\n\"Are you sure? I can call the MedTechs\"\n\"No... I'm fine. You're sign said you're\ntwenty-two. When's your birthday?\"\nShe leaned back in her chair as if trying to put\ndistance between them. \"Why?\"\n\"I... just need to know.\"\n\"Sorry, Jack. I don't give that kind of information\nout to anyone. Especially customers. You can\nunderstand that... right?\"\nHe nodded and after a few seconds rose on unsteady\nlegs to fetch the rest of their meal.\nDuring dinner he watched her eat, the way she\ngestured with her fork while talking, the way she\nseparated her food on the plate and grew even more\ncertain. It had to be Elaine. That's why he didn't\nneed the goggles. That is why he'd forgotten. She\nhad come back. He'd never believed in\nreincarnation, but there were other possibilities.\nHe excused himself and went to the bedroom where he\nkept Elaine's bracelet draped over her picture.\nWhen he laid it on the table before Sydney her eyes\ngrew wide and she picked it up.\n\"Oh Jack, this is beautiful.\"\n\"Do you recognize it?\"\nHer eyebrows knitted together and she examined it\ncloser. \"No... should I?\"\nDoubt crept up Jack's back. He took the bracelet, a\nlittle too quickly perhaps, and admired it in the\ncandlelight. The small pearls were set in a hand\nwoven filigree of hair thin gold wire. It had been\nher grandmother's and she had worn it every day he\nhad known her. Her family wanted her buried with\nit, but he had selfishly insisted on keeping it for\nhimself. She should have remembered.\n\"So... will you be working Cooper Street from now\non? In case I want to find you again?\"\nShe blinked, glanced once more at the bracelet, then\npicked at her salad. \"I suppose... in the evenings\nanyway. Come early.\"\n\"I noticed that you aren't a student, so why only\nthe evenings? There's more competition at night.\"\nShe stared at him as she chewed and appeared to\nconsider her answer. Then she swallowed, shrugged\nand dabbed her mouth. \"I have a day job. I'm doing\nthis for the extra income. A matter of economics\nreally. If I find an overnight gig, and I usually\ndo, then I'm getting paid while I sleep and I don't\nhave the expense of a room.\"\n\"Very clever. You must be putting away quite a bit\nof money. Are you planning an early retirement?\"\n\"An early Ascension,\" she said.\nHe felt ice in his guts. It was too cruel. Did she\ncome back just to torture him? He didn't know if he\ncould bear that again. He had to stop her. \"Why\nAscension?\"\n\"You don't approve?\" she mumbled around a smile. \"I\nwould never have pegged someone with your reputation\non Cooper Street to be one of the religious elite\nthat preach against the Heavens. They're usually\nmuch more circumspect with their pleasures and\nperversions.\"\n\"I have no religious problem with Ascension. They\ndeveloped Ascension for those who were going to die\nno matter what. But you're young and pretty and\nhave your whole life ahead of you. Why give that\nall up for a fake, digital existence? It would be a\nterrible waste.\"\n\"A waste? Of what? This body? Maybe to men like\nyou who pay to use it, but it's standing in my way.\nIt's a bottleneck in my learning.\"\n\"What do you mean? I don't understand.\"\nSydney put her empty salad bowl aside and sat back\nin her chair. \"For some people, there is more to a\ndigital existence than just the Heavens. I'm a\nphysicist... or at least I'm trying to be. I was\nwhat some people call a child prodigy. I graduated\nhigh school at fifteen, received my Bachelors at\neighteen and my PhD last year, but I'm already\nbehind. If I study my whole natural life I will not\nlearn one percent of what I could learn in a single\nyear of digital life. My digital peers have instant\naccess to every scrap of data known to man, they\neven think at the speed of light! How can I\ncompete?\"\n\"But... you're a physicist!\"\n\"And it means nothing. There's no place in the\nphysical world for people like me anymore.\"\nJack took a deep breath and changed tactics. \"Okay,\nI can see your point, but what's the rush? You have\nyour whole life to study physics.\"\n\"Because I'm running out of time! I'm going on\nthe...\" she stopped and looked down at her hands.\n\"I have my reasons.\"\nJack knew from the look on her face that it was a\nlosing battle, but he couldn't stop. She just\ndidn\u2019t understand. \"Don't you have family? Why\ncan't you live your real life first?\"\n\"Real?\" she said and pointed the fork at her\ndress. \"Is this real? Wasting your life\nlooking at hookers through plasma goggles?\"\nJack stiffened and sat up straight. Her comment\nstung like a slap, but what alarmed him even more\nwas the fact that she was on the edge of her seat,\nwith her hands on the table. She was going to leave\nif he pushed it further. He had to calm her down\nand stall her.\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said.\n\"No... I'm sorry, Jack. That was out of line,\" she\nsaid and touched his hand. \"And I'm sure you didn't\nbring me here to argue philosophy.\"\nHe faked a smile and shrugged. \"House?\"\n\"Yes, Jack,\" said a bland voice from the ceiling.\n\"Play dance compilation number three.\"\nSoft music filled the air and Jack stood up offering\nhis arm. \"Would you like to dance, Sydney?\"\nShe blinked and smiled. \"I'd like that very much.\"\n* * * * *\nThe wine and dancing had filled Sydney with new life\nand she little resembled the cold, stoic woman Jack\nhad found on Cooper Street. She giggled and teased\nwhile tugging him up the stairs to the bedroom, then\ntook complete control after sliding between the\nsheets. For the first time in many years, Jack\nenjoyed not directing his bedmate in the arts of\nbeing Elaine, because she already knew.\nAfterward, they lay listening to the rain pelt the\nwindows. Jack inhaled her scent - clean hair mixed\nwith the faint aroma of sex - and could think of\nnothing more pleasant. He tried to work out how the\nAscension Foundation could implant a digital soul\ninto a newborn child. How and why?\nLightning highlighted her naked side in stark blue\nand white. He let his fingers slide down her arm to\nher hip and thigh. She sighed and pulled his arm\ntighter around her.\n\"I haven't danced like that since my high school\nprom.\"\n\"What a waste,\" Jack said.\n\"Yeah... I guess time moves fast for things like\nthat.\"\n\"And slow for other things.\"\nShe stroked Jack's arm. \"Elaine's dead, isn't she?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"She must have been young when it happened. I\nmean... you always pick young women to be Elaine,\nright?\"\n\"It was twenty-two years ago,\" he whispered.\nThunder rumbled and Jack could feel the vibration of\nthe old house through the mattress as she stiffened\nin his arms.\n\"Is that why you asked about my birthday?\"\nHe nodded, his nose rubbing against the back of her\nhead.\n\"What happened?\"\n\"She slipped on the ice and hit her head. I watched\nher die over the period of a month, but I wouldn't\nlet them shut off the machines or disconnect her\nfrom the medical network while I tried to find the\nmoney to pay for her Ascension. It was new then and\neven more expensive than it is now. Of course the\ndamned Ascension Foundation wouldn't take her\nwithout the money and she died before I'd even\nraised half the amount.\"\n\"So that\u2019s why you're so against Ascension,\" she\nsaid and squeezed his hand. \"I'm sorry. I\nshouldn't have asked.\"\n\"You are so much like her.\"\n\"But I'm not her, Jack.\"\nShe didn't remember. How would she know if she had\nbeen Elaine in a previous life? Lightning flashed,\nfollowed immediately by a house rattling thunder.\nShe squealed and burrowed almost under him.\n\"Now it's your turn,\" he said. \"Why the hurry to\nAscend?\"\nShe turned toward him. He could just make out her\nsmile in the dark. \"I'm going on the Wayfarer\nExpedition.\"\nJack felt the hairs on his neck rise, the way they\nalways did when he heard something odd. The\nWayfarer spacecraft wasn't designed to carry flesh\nand blood humans. The amounts of air, water and\nfood would be prohibitive, but they could take\nthousands of digital humans.\nIf Sydney didn't have the money to Ascend, she\ncouldn't go. The Wayfarer spacecraft had already\ntaken its shakedown cruise. It would be leaving the\nsystem within weeks. All he had to do was find a\nway to stall her.\n\"Why is going on that expedition so important?\"\n\"I guess I could answer that with a question. Why\nwouldn't anyone want to go? It's the first\nreally new chance for adventure in generations. I\nmean even those Ascended folks populating their fake\nRome's and Dodge City's know their world isn't\nreal. But this is real, and it's an\nopportunity to contribute something important to the\nhuman race. We'll be spending perhaps hundreds of\nyears studying and exploring a new star system. And\nwho's to say that we won't build more ships and\nlaunch new expeditions to other stars? The things\nwe'll see, Jack! How could you not want to go?\"\nHow could he argue with an eternity among the\nstars? He couldn't, but he couldn't let her go\neither. He had to try. \"There could be lots of\nproblems with that ship, Sydney. There's the\npossibility of excessive radiation that even digital\npeople couldn't survive.\"\n\"Humanity has only made leaps forward when we take\nrisks. They'll need people like me. By becoming\npart of the digital collective, I'll not just be a\nphysicist, but a super-intellect, a true marriage of\nmachine and human mind.\"\nLightning flashed and he could see hard\ndetermination in her face.\n\"How close are you? They'll be leaving within a\nmonth. Will you have the money by then?\"\n\"I'm hoping they won't leave that soon. They've had\ndozens of delays already and I'm getting very\nclose. In another six months I'll have enough.\"\n\"Six months?\"\n\"And if they leave before I'm ready, there are other\noptions.\"\n\"But...\"\n\"You know, Jack, if you Ascended, you wouldn't need\nthe goggles. In your digital form you could be with\nyour Elaine construct all the time.\"\n\"That's not going to happen. I'll never give them a\npenny of my money.\"\n\"You mean you aren't planning to Ascend? Ever?\"\n\"Of course not. Not after they let you die.\"\nThe storm had moved to the East and for several\nminutes only distant rolling thunder broke the\nsilence. She moved away from him and rolled over.\n\"Good night, Jack. Thanks for the dancing.\"\n* * * * *\nWhen Jack woke the next morning, Elaine was gone.\nShe had slipped away without a note. He slammed his\nfist into the mattress and cursed himself. How\ncould she get out of the bed without waking him? He\nwent to the window and looked out, hoping beyond\nhope to see her coming up the walk with a bag of\nbagels or two cups of coffee. But she was gone.\n\"House?\"\n\"Yes, Jack?\" the ceiling said in its blandly\nannoying voice.\n\"What time did Elaine leave?\"\n\"Elaine, sir?\"\n\"I mean Sydney.\"\n\"3:21 a.m.\"\n\"Did she do anything before leaving? Did she...\ntake anything?\"\n\"She used your netpad to check an opnet message site\nbetween 2:51 and 3:10 a.m., then immediately used it\nagain to call a taxi, which arrived at 3:21a.m. She\ndidn't take anything that I could track, Sir.\"\n\"Show me the message boards she accessed.\"\nThe wall panel blinked onto a web page adorned by a\nflowing rainbow that seemed to come out of the\nscreen at Jack. He blinked at the tacky display and\nordered the house to show him the messages she had\nread or left.\n\"I'm sorry Sir, but the site is password protected.\nOnly members have access to the message boards.\"\n\"Well, she logged in from here; surely you have a\nrecord of her password. What is it?\"\n\"I'm sorry Sir. I'm not allowed to record that\ninformation.\"\n\"Damn it!\" Jack said and slammed his open hand\nagainst the table. The house didn't comment.\n\"Who owns the site?\"\n\"A group called Ascension Salad, Sir.\"\nJack stood up and started pacing again. \"Search the\nPressNets for any information about Ascension\nSalad. What are they all about?\"\n\"Here is a quote from the Boston Globe that says,\n\"Ascension Salad is a suicide cult with a unique\nperspective. They believe that everyone who dies\nwhile connected to a network automatically Ascends\nto a digital existence, but only those who pay for\nthe service are allowed to interact with the\nphysical world.\"\n\"Suicide? No! Elaine!\"\n* * * * *\nAfter five days, the girls and boys there no longer\nwasted their breath trying to seduce Jack as he\nwalked aimlessly up and down Cooper Street. She'd\nsaid she needed to make lots of money, so she should\nbe there on the street peddling herself. So where\nwas she?\nHe looked around at the noisy Cooper Street\nsidewalk. Life there went on... the whores hocked\ntheir bodies to anyone who would pay... the alleys\nstill stank... the cars crept by with leering\ndrivers. Jack sat down on the curb in front of a\nused electronics dealer and considered the very real\npossibility that he would never see her again, that\nshe would die again because she couldn't pay\nthe price to get into the Heavens.\nAfter a few minutes he stood up, brushed off his\npants and dropped the netpad into his pocket. When\nhe looked back at the washed out screens on the\ntelevisions lining the shop window, he saw a picture\nof the Wayfarer spacecraft. He ran inside and\nturned the volume higher.\n\"StarCorp announced this morning that the lasers\ndriving the Wayfarer spacecraft would fire at 7:30am\nGMT tomorrow, beginning the first human guided\nexploration of...\"\n\"Hey you!\" the shopkeeper yelled. \"You buy or go\naway!\"\nJack looked at the ancient Asian woman, but really\ndidn't hear her. The news piece continued, telling\nmore background on the expedition and their target\nstar system, but nothing new.\n\"And... from our state news pool...reports are\ncoming in about widespread suicides. Within minutes\nof StarCorp's announcement, dozens of people across\nthe state... no... this seems to be a national\nphenomenon. We are getting similar reports from Los\nAngeles, Atlanta and St. Louis that members of a\nsuicide cult called Ascension Salad are...\"\n\"Hey you... man!\" The tiny, wrinkled lady\nswitched off the old television and glared at him\nwith fists on her hips.\nHe mumbled an apology and stepped out onto the\nstreet in a daze. \"Please don't die, Elaine. Not\nagain. Please.\"\nA woman's laugh drew Jack's attention to a hooker\nand her customer standing next to the storefront.\nThey reached an agreement and walked away together\nas drizzling rain started to fall. He ignored them\nand the rain, but kept looking at the blank sign.\nWith a trembling hand he pulled his netpad out and\nturned it on.\n\"Netpad? Find the prostitution transaction of\nSeptember third, this year.\"\n\"Transaction displayed,\" the netpad said.\nHe selected the line and ordered a second\ntransaction. \"Transfer two hundred thousand dollars\nto this same account number. Then notify the owner\nof the transaction.\"\n\"Voice verification approved, please hold your right\neye to the screen for retinal verification.\"\nJack did as ordered and tried to hold the netpad\nsteady between quivering hands.\n\"Retinal verification complete. Transaction\napproved.\"\nHe took a deep ragged breath, dropped the netpad in\nhis pocket and leaned against the wall. A security\ndrone floated by with its cameras aimed at Jack and\nthe tiny fans sounding like drunken bees. He sighed\nand closed his eyes.\nHis netpad buzzed and his heart leapt in his chest.\nHe fumbled it out and answered. An error message\nflashed on the screen. \"Last transaction denied.\nRecipient account was closed at 6:19pm today.\"\nJack had sent the money at 6:26. He pocketed the\nnetpad and stood on the sidewalk letting the rain\ndrench him. He eventually started home but he\ndidn't have the energy or the desire to open his\numbrella. As he passed the girls and boys huddled\nunder their flimsy awnings he no longer saw\npotential Elaines. Instead he saw tired, desperate\nfaces on hopeless young people. It made him feel\nlonely and old.\nAs he opened the door to the apartment, his netpad\nbuzzed. The origin of the incoming message was from\nthe Ascension Salad.\n\"Hello?\"\n\"This is an automated, forwarded message and will\nnot repeat. Please stay on the line.\"\nHis hands started to shake and he stumbled to the\nsofa to sit down.\n\"Hi Jack. Wayfarer let me have one call before we\nleave local space and I wanted to use it to\napologize for leaving the way I did and to tell you\nthat I left Elaine's grandmother's bracelet on the\ntable. Take care and please reconsider Ascension.\"\nThe message ended and disconnected.\n* * * * *\nJack stepped out of the cab and looked up at the\nGreek columns that lined the front of the Ascension\nFoundation building. He didn't know if Elaine had\nbeen reborn in Sydney or if she had actually\nAscended when she died twenty-two years before. And\nit didn't matter. He raised the bracelet to his\nlips, kissed the pearls and went to find Elaine.\nTHE END\nEmail:\nSend us your comments on this story!\nReturn to\nOriginal\nFiction","source":null,"source-hostname":null,"excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/yplUYo2MpKcBVofGjPnXQgXGOEo.json"}

Fatigued fuel lines whimpered with\ncontraction as the flow of hydro\/oxy ebbed. The Promius\nrested -- drifting, seemingly still, at the relative velocity of the\ncloud mass.\nBatus\nGanebi studied the readouts of the samples they had scooped up.\n\"Looks\ngood.\" He grinned his wide, gap-toothed grin. \"Looks real\ngood.\"\nThe\npilot, Sergai Vladovich, reached forward, his worn\nG-couch\ncreaking in protest, to flip a contact. \"Containment field\nactivated.\"\n\"Shit,\nman. You ever get excited? Look at these specs. One cube-liter of this\ncloud mass could blast a warp-hole in the space\/time continuum, big\nenough for a motherlovin' starliner. This is big.\"\n\"Universe\nis big, Ganebi.\" Sergai shrugged his shoulders. \"This is cloud\n... poeben' spooky one. Don't you feel it? Like someone watching\nus behind back.\"\nBatus\nshook his head. \"This is a fuckin' great cloud -- jammed full of\nenergy. I've never seen anything this good before.\"\nSergai\neyed him. \"Lots of things you never see.\" He turned back to\nlocking down systems, muttering to himself. \"Like wedding ring on\nfinger of friend's wife.\"\nBatus\nignored him as he always did. \"Man, this is so close to home, we\ncould spit a load there. You know what this is worth.\"\nSergai\nsighed, his thick lips pursed in a frown of pity. \"Worth? Is all\nyou think of -- is it waluable?\"\n\"Now\ncomes the 'Doing it For the Good of Humanity' speech.\"\nSergai\ngrinned, his ripe old pockmarked face creasing up in ragged lines.\n\"Shut up you face, okay? This time is your turn. Deploy the zlo'ebuchy\nextractor nozzle and get out there and suck it up. I want get out of\nhere. This cloud give me creeps.\"\n#\n...\nwake ...\nStirrings\nfrom the matter shell intruder. An opening. Energy spilling out. A\nsmaller object emerges. Spurts of energy. The small shell moves,\ndragging a sinewy line of matter behind it.\n...\nan intelligent life form ... it had to be ...\n#\n\"Extractor\nin place, man. Start it up.\"\nSergai\nleaned forward to flip the contact. A low drone back in the engine\nsection told him the Promius's aged extractors had actually\ndecided to function without coaxing today. He fingered the commlink,\nkeeping his eyes on the sensors. \"Pumping begins. Move to right.\nSlow.\"\n\"Damn,\nI know how to do this, okay?\"\n\"Just\nwant to finish ... fast.\"\n#\n...\npain ... draining ...\nThe\nsmall object with the line of matter. Must surround it. Study it.\nMatter\n-- just inert matter. Wait. A small opening to the inside. Energy\nescaping in short bursts. Inside, more energy. Organic life energy.\n...\nI knew that was a mistake ...\n#\nSergai\nwatched the monitors, guiding Ganebi to the highest concentrations of\nZPE, but his uneasiness increased.\nAgainst\na possible EVA-glitch he wore his pressure suit, the helmet resting on a\nlocker behind him. He flipped the commlink. \"What you are doing? I\nsaid left and down. Hello?\" No answer. He wiped his forehead.\n\"Ganebi?\"\nOn\nthe monitor he watched his partner release the extractor and rotate back\nto the ship. A spray of ions, white against the gray of the cloud,\njetted him toward the EVA hatch.\n\"Hey,\nwhat you are doing? We not finish.\"\n\"I'm...\"\nGanebi's voice trailed off.\n\"What?\"\n\"...\nnot ... feeling ... good.\" Ganebi's voice came in bursts now, with\nmoaning between words and funny squeaking sounds. \"Returning ... to\n... ship ...\"\n\"Ebat'-kopat'!\"\nSergai slammed his fist down on the control panel. \"I knew cloud\nwas bad news.\"\n\"Open\n... the hatch.\"\nOut\nof long habit Sergai's hand reached for the contact to let Ganebi in.\nBut this time he paused. \"What if ... whatever you got, gets in\nhere?\"\n\"Hey,\nSergeman.\" Ganebi sounded suddenly stronger. \"It's just a ...\nqueasy stomach. C'mon, let me in. I just need to ... take something for\nit ... then I'll get back out and finish the job.\"\nSergai\nhesitated a moment longer, thinking how he owed this guy nothing, then\nstabbed his finger down. The EVA hatch condition-light lit up -- OPEN.\n\"Okay. But hurry, this place give me creeps.\"\n\"Coming\nup.\"\n\"Close\nEVA hatch first. Dolboy'eb!\"\nNo\nanswer.\n\"Ganebi?\"\nSweat soaked Sergai's face. \"What you doing?\"\nThe\nairlock-hatch condition light still glowed OPEN. Then the\ndecompression-warning buzzer went off.\n\"Ganebi!\"\nSergai slapped the emergency cabin-hatch seal switch and scrambled to\nhis locker, slamming his helmet on and twist-locking it. The hiss of\npressurization and the touch of cool air on his face bolstered him some.\nHe\nsat at the controls and switched the monitor to the airlock cam. His\nview showed the open EVA-hatch. Stars, barely visible through the haze\nof the cloud, wheeled in the opening\n-- a\nuniversal circle dance.\nHe\npunched the EVA-hatch emergency override. The door refused to close.\nZooming in, he spotted where Ganebi had cut the hydraulic hose. The only\nway to close it now was to go down there and crank it shut. But he\nwasn't leaving the bridge until he knew what his partner, he snorted,\nwas up to.\nFlipping\nthrough the various cameras, he finally located him standing outside the\ncabin-hatch, waiting.\n\"Ganebi?\nWhat is problem? Why you rig EVA-hatch open?\"\n\"Let\nme in, Sergai. Need medicine.\"\n\"Am\nnot letting you in until you tell me what fuck you doing.\"\n\"Everything's\nokay. Just need the medpak. C'mon, open up.\"\n\"Is\nvacuum out there. I crack hatch, you be blown into bulkhead. Me\ntoo.\"\n\"Then\nvent the cabin pressure, man.\"\n\"No\nway I am going to do that. Go down, crank EVA-hatch closed, then we\nreturn to station. You get med-help there.\"\n\"Listen,\nSergai. We can't do that. You said it yourself: something is wrong with\nthis cloud. Well, I figured it out. I know what to do. Just cut me some\nslack and open up, hey?\"\n\"But\nyou said you feel bad. Bad stomach.\"\n\"Had\nto say that. Someone, or something, was listening. They can't hear us\nnow. Trust me.\"\n\"Is\npirates?\"\n\"Yeah.\nVent cabin pressure and open up. I know what to do. I was Security,\nremember?\"\nIt\nwas true -- he'd been Security. Sergai was Engineering, what did he know\nabout this kind of situation? But it boiled down to a matter of trust.\nHow could you trust a man that stole your wife then dumped her on some\nplanet? Even if she had begged him to do it, how could a man do that to\na friend?\nDamn\nit all, if pirates were around, he had to stick with the man despite his\nfeelings. Just like he had all these years to make a living. But why had\nthe idiot left the hatch open? Why depressurize the whole ship? He\nlacked answers, but knew Ganebi familiar with this kind of situation.\nSergai\npivoted to the controls. \"Okay.\" Slapping off the vacuum\nwarning, he hit the emergency vent switch, which opened after several\nminutes. Damn old tub! Sergai had served on starliners -- they should\nhave orbited this chemical-burning fossil into the nearest star decades\nago. But as long as it could find and suck up high concentrations of\nZero Point Energy, it still had a job to do.\nHis\nsuit stiffened as pressure fell. In a few minutes the vacuum warning\nlight glowed. He faced the door, reaching back to flip the cabin-hatch\ncontact. The door opened. Ganebi's space-suited figure stood at the\nhatch, not moving -- his faceplate a black mirror.\n\"Ganebi?\"\nThe\nfigure shook as if waking. \"What?\"\n\"Hatch\nis open.\"\n\"Yeah.\nRight. Hey, switch off the gravity, will ya?\"\n\"Switch\noff gravity generators?\"\n\"And\nlife support, engineering -- everything. Shut it down. Shut the whole\nship down.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"It's\n... necessary. Trust me.\"\nSergai\nsat at the controls and ran his hand down the bank of emergency cutoffs.\nOverhead lights blinked out, then flickered back on, dim on battery\npower. He rose to face Ganebi, feet lifting off the deck until he\nremembered to power up his boot magnets. His partner floated in the\nhatch, not heeding the lack of gravity.\nGanebi's\nhands grasped his helmet. \"Hey, Sergai ... got something to show\nyou.\"\n\"What?\nWhat can you show me?\"\nHe\ntwisted the helmet.\n\"No!\nI depressurized the ship -- don't take off helmet.\"\n\"It's\nokay. Gotta show you something.\"\nWith\na jerk, he cracked the seal. Misty air expelled as he lifted the helmet\noff and tossed it aside, then unzipped his suit, spreading it open.\nSergai\ngrabbed a bulkhead support and screamed like a child thrown into a ditch\nfull of spiders.\nGanebi's\nhead, his whole body, was a mass of tiny whirling lights, like millions\nof gnats buzzing around, confined in the shape of a man. It floated in\nfront of Sergai doing nothing until the old man got control of himself\nand stopped shrieking.\n\"Ganebi,\nwhat happened? What is this?\"\nThere\nwas no mouth to move, but a hole opened-and-closed in the swirling,\nlighted head as Ganebi answered.\n\"Eing'hjels,\nSergai. They're all over me. All in me.\"\n\"What\nare they doing? What do they want?\"\n\"They're\nlike us. They want Zero Point. Only they want to make it.\"\n\"Make\nZero Point? Nothing can do that.\"\n\"These\ncan. They turn organic matter into Zero Point Energy. This started with\njust one little helper. From my cells, my organic matter, it produced\nreplicas of itself. Then the replicas made more copies. Now they want\nmore. Much more.\"\nThe\nluminous shape of Batus Ganebi fluxed, wavered, then gushed out of the\nfloating suit. Streams of eing'hjels surrounded Sergai, who screamed\nagain as they found the opening of his waste exhaust. Bypassing the\nvalve they flooded in, overwhelming, attacking -- altering every living\ncell they encountered into a clone of themselves.\nIn\ntime Sergai stopped screaming. His clumsy suit settled into the G-couch\nbefore the controls. After the cloud had moved away, he powered up the\nengine and boosted toward station.\n#\nThe\nmatter shell spurts hot energy and eases farther away from the cloud.\n...\nnot long now ... not long ... wait ... try to sleep ... follow later ...\nsleep ... sweet sleep ...\n#\n\"Sergai,\nhave you gone batty or what?\" Assistant Docking Officer of Fycus\nStation, Bryan O'Hara, couldn't believe his instruments. He rapped a\nknuckle on them, but nothing changed.\n\"Don't\nknow what you are talking about.\"\n\"You've\ndepressurized your ship, shut down life support. Your EVA hatch is\nrigged open, and you're dragging your extractor hose behind you -- half\nof it burnt off by your exhaust. Are you really telling me there's no\nproblem?\"\n\"Trust\nme. You know old Sergai. Yes, something happened. Ganebi is hurt,\nunconscious. But danger is over. He needs medical help. Please, let me\ndock.\"\n\"Hold\non ... not yet. Uh, try explaining this again. From right where you\nare.\"\n\"My\npleasure. I just think old Ganebi here can't last much longer.\"\n\"Bugger.\nOkay, but you'd better not be pulling anything.\" Bryan unlocked a\ndocking ring. \"You have docking clearance at B-level, dock three,\nring nine.\"\nBryan\nwatched the Promius shudder into position. What was wrong with Sergai?\nHe could jockey better than that. Should he wake the commander?\nHe\nhit the intercom. \"DockConn to Medical. Who's there?\"\nAfter\na short delay the relay clicked. \"Hey, Bryan. It's just me, Kaveka.\nWhat's up?\"\nKaveka.\nWhat a break!\n\"Hi,\nKav. Listen, old Sergai's docking the Promius at\nB-three-niner.\nSays Batus is unconscious or something. Grab a medpak and hustle down\nthere, will ya?\"\n\"Sure\nthing, on my way.\"\nHe\nexhaled. Kaveka was stable and competent. Attractive too. Which didn't\nmatter for this, but--\nThe\nPromius fired its port thruster again. Why did he have to do that so\nmany times just to line up for final approach? Bryan wiped his brow.\nCripes, it was just old Sergai and Batus. Still, it was strange. He\nflicked the ShipComm relay. \"Cut your buggin' speed, Sergai. You\nwant to dock ... or ram us?\"\nNo\nanswer, but the braking jets fired a last pulse. Promius made contact,\nlocking on with no damage -- barely.\nSergai's\na better pilot than that. What was going on? Bryan decided to inspect\nthe ring port himself. He checked his proximity sensors. No local\ntraffic. He pocketed his handcomm and dashed out.\nHe\nrendezvoused with Kaveka at the ring lock. She was adjusting the lock's\npurge parameters. She smiled at him. A friendly, lopsided grin.\n\"Thought I'd better run a bio-filter purge. Never know what these\nold farts will drag home.\"\n\"Yeah.\nGood thinking.\" He pulled his eyes away from counting the sprinkle\nof freckles on her nose. \"Make sure you seal that outer hatch. They\ncame in depressurized.\"\n\"Always\ndo that anyway.\" She turned her head to him, her long black hair\nforming a halo around her head in the zero grav. \"Did you say\ndepressurized? What the hell are they playing at?\"\n\"Don't\nknow.\" Their eyes locked for an awkward moment. He managed to tear\nhis gaze away from her golden irises long enough to check the dial for\nher. \"Uh, cycle's done.\"\nShe\ngrinned at him before turning back to flip the unlock switch.

Shastar felt his palms become clammy as he thought about\nit, wondering whether this time he would fail and the great vessel lose\nits direction, to sail the infinite darkness of space for eternity.\nHe\nhad been here eleven months and seven of the great starships had passed.\nEach time he had succeeded in tuning the Lighthouse Lamp and known the\ndelight of a challenging task well done. Yet, as the agony of self-doubt\ngnawed at him, he knew that past success meant nothing.\nRather\nthan fret away the hours waiting for the passage of VS Aries Delta,\nhe labored in his studio. Using nano-scale voice-modulated gravity\ngenerators to bend and coil laser beams, he made a rainbow bracelet. It\nwas pretty, in particular when he used the voice of Janerith Tammarlain\nfrom Sadelmelek, singing the wild love songs of that young culture.\nYes,\nit was pretty. He destroyed it and nearly himself too, as despair\nchallenged hope. The anxiety ticked in his brain: very soon his time\nhere would be over. Outside, fear of his own inadequacy would confront\nhim in full measure. He was as frightened of staying as of leaving this\nhiding place.\nShastar\nwatched his artistic failure disappear into the atomizer then went to\nthe Tuning Gallery. It was time. If he did not try, the Lighthouse would\nremain unlit.\nUsing\nbody-capacitance to alter resonant frequencies, he danced between\ncolumns of pale fire, brushing his hands across their velvet electric\nsurfaces. As he touched them, colors changed, organ-like tones echoed\nand he ran faster.\nHe\nspun from ultraviolet to infrared, from bat shrill to marrow-quaking\nrumble, weaving with mind and body an ever-changing composition.\nIntuition inspired and logic commanded: this column, bring it a\nsemitone down with a caress of palm, ah, and those two, their reds a\nshade too alike, quickly, quickly.\nBecause\nhis subconscious forged a true composition, the electromagnetic signal\nmodulated onto the vacuum-state carrier-wave was valid and the\ninexpressible distortion of space-time that was the Aries Delta\nfled safely past. It was an hour of clock time that he danced but his\ninner being, where emotion reigned, knew not time.\nAs\nhis strength faded, slowing the dance, he became aware that a quiet\nvoice was calling but his mind refused, at first, to understand.\nShastar,\nyou can stop now. Shastar, stop, stop ...\nHis\nmind cleared and he fell to the floor, drained. The rush of joy from\nthis dance of creation flew him higher than any drug ever could, and\nleft him weak. He lay on the soft floor that conformed to his bones and\ncontemplated the miracle. Again he had succeeded and he marveled at the\nvictory.\nThe\nmachines came to him, cradling his fragility in their powerful hands,\nand carried him to his bed. There they massaged his body till the aches\neased, fed him sips of nourishing liquids that tasted of all the\nchildhood summers in the world and finally left him in sleep.\nHe\nslept for twelve hours and awoke to the music of Beethoven's Sixth\nSymphony. A Dancer from ancient Earth, Beethoven was judged by Pure\nSynthesists as too primitive to bother studying, but Shastar thought\notherwise. With a wave of pleasure surging in him, he stretched then sat\nup.\nA\nvoice spoke. Not the one that called him from the dance, one older, more\nimpersonal.\n\"Good\nmorning, Shastar. Will you have breakfast now?\"\n\"Good\nmorning, Chandor. Yes, I will. Oh, please open the curtains.\" He\nknew he was talking to a machine but that was irrelevant: the intricate\npersonality was complete, its nonhuman genesis indiscernible.\nA\nsmall man in his late fifties, hair being allowed to go gray and thin,\nhe moved to a straight-backed chair at a small table and ate with gusto.\nThe euphoria did not last beyond a day and he meant to enjoy it while he\ncould. The tender fillets of fresh-caught trout, crisp toast and English\nmarmalade gave him huge satisfaction. It was all synthetic, of course,\nbut there was no way he could tell (not that he ever thought about it).\nAfter\nthe simple meal, Shastar showered and dressed in the light robe that\nChandor designed and made in his choice of color and style. Then he\nwalked out into the garden.\nLittle\npaths of river stones wound between masterpieces of horticulture. He\ncould wander as long as he had strength yet never come to the end of the\ngarden, and every fork in his path offered the familiar or the new and\nequally beautiful. Mount Fujiyama floated on the horizon, ancient and\nserene, and close behind him, an icon of his dwelling was always\nvisible.\nThe\ngarden was in most part an illusion, and he knew the country that had\nbeen Japan was six hundred and fifty light years away, yet the knowledge\ndid not tarnish the pleasure. If he desired a tangible garden, well, he\ncould command the machines to provide that as well. Neither did Shastar\nmarvel at the wonder of it; the underlying science, long forgotten by\nmankind, was taken for granted.\nThere\nwere four gardens: a deciduous forest, a desert of stone, a seashore\n(where he trudged endless kilometers of beach), and this one, his favorite.\nGreat-grandfather a score of times removed, who had made the pilgrimage\nto Earth, wrote a book which didn't sell but the chapter on Japan had\nentranced a young man many centuries later.\nHe\nstrolled for a few hours, read a real book (one of his quirks, printed\nfor him by the ever amenable Chandor), ate a snack, and dozed a while.\nSo the day passed. The yearning to do something gnawed at him, but he\nshrank away from the studio: he was too vulnerable there.\nIt\nhad been his life, before: the creation, through months, sometimes years\nof intense effort, of single unique works that reached out to all of\nhumanity's senses, and beyond. By art and engineering Shastar united\nmusic, light and matter into harmonies that helped people see beyond\ntheir immediate struggle for existence.\nOnce,\nhe created; now, in this narrow world, he was ... useful.\nFour\nyears ago he had sold \"Galactic Birth\" to the Junter Art\nGallery. It called forth in every spectator emotions that came from\nchildhood wells long thought dry.\nAt\nthe reception after the first performance he met Rantha. Her of the\nwaist-long golden hair that flooded men's hearts with desire. Of women\nShastar knew nothing but when she called him, he went with her.\nShastar\nhad sold \"Galaxy\" for enough money to live and compose for\nfive years in his frugal way. Rantha knew he was worth a great deal more\nand she wanted him, only partly for selfish reasons, to mine more gold\nfrom his talent. Others in his field made copies and became rich. He had\nnever even considered the merits of this. He simply created.\nHe\nhad argued but she was more persuasive. At last he made six copies of a\nminor work and sold them for much money. That night he discovered part\nof the price he had paid. In her bed his body failed him and she\nlaughed. Not through cruelty, yet her amusement sliced out a vital part\nof him and he fled.\nThat\nhumiliation he could live with, but worse was to follow. Every\nsubsequent creation, despite public acclaim, felt hollow, empty of\nsubstance. At first merely uneasy, then, as time passed and he could\nproduce nothing that had meaning, a profound dread started rending him\napart.\nShastar\nwas a collector of religions, having found the myths of mankind, and the\nno less manifold ones of Kysad and Droosh, to be a rich source of\ninspiration for his works. But he could not find in them a remedy.\nNothing he tried filled the yawning cavern within him.\nTuning\na starship beacon was the highest paid and least desired positions in\nthe Empire. Navigation at relativistic velocities depended critically on\nsensing the gravity flux at decision points. Since a second of ship time\nwas years in the \"real\" world, no margin of error was\npossible. When, further, the absolute movement of nearby stars, even the\nrotation of the galaxy, changed the gravity patterns, then it could be\nunderstood why the skills of the Lighthouse Keepers were so vital to the\nEmpire.\nThese\nlonely men and women in their remote eyries, sensed the ponderous\nmovement of the stars and tuned the vacuum-state maser till it felt\nright. It was one skill that no machine could emulate well enough. Some\ninner, unfathomable affinity with the spiritual was crucial. Few had the\nvital ability and all were creative artists. Such were not easily\npersuaded to remove themselves to remote places and live in isolation\nfor a year at a time.\nShastar\nhad seized on the opportunity to withdraw from society, safe from all\npossibility of failure. Yet, not safe, as he now knew, from the vacuum\nwithin himself. Worse, although the tuning was at first creative and\nremained formidable, it soon became repetitive.\nNow,\nwalking, so as to become tired and thus enable sleep, he made his way to\nthe second level of the Lighthouse, high above. Although Chandor was\ndisturbed by such an abnormal habit, Shastar often came here to stare\nout of the windows, hour upon hour. Two AUs distant from its sun, a\nnameless K-class star near Adhara, the planet was a desolation of rock\nand ice that the small orange star failed to warm.\nAbove\nhim was only the vacuum-state transmitter and no biological being could\nexist there. Flesh, and perhaps spirit too, would be reduced to ash in\nthat forbidden place. It drew him. He weighed again, without emotion,\nthe question whether he should destroy himself or continue living\nwithout reason. That the Lighthouse must have a Keeper had stayed his\nhand so far but such emptiness could not be endured much longer.\nIt\nwas some time before Shastar noticed the shadow moving over an expanse\nof ice. The shock jerked him to his feet. This place was lifeless! No\natmosphere, average temperature minus 200 C, gravity half Earth\nStandard. Yet it was there, a regular gray series of flowing sine waves.\nTo be visible from so high it must be very large.\n\"Chuntath,\"\nhe called.\nChuntath\nwas the scientific expression of the machine that also housed the\npersonalities of Chandor and the Companion, Lynith\/Petrain.\n\"Hi,\nShastar,\" came the answer. \"What can I do for you?\"\n\"There\nis ... something, out on the surface. I'm looking from the east\nwindow.\"\n\"I\nhave observed it. The instruments give conflicting results. There are\nnone of the neural characteristics of biological life, yet the behavior\ncertainly indicates directed intelligence. The spectroscope shows\nemission lines all over the place. Well, let me be honest ... I don't\nknow what it is.\"\nChuntath's\nconfusion was quite significant and deeply disturbing. He could solve\nsix-body problems instantly - one did not expect him to falter at\nanything.\nShastar's\nspine tingled with unaccustomed excitement. Fear and curiosity, emotions\nhe had not felt for a long time, vied within him. This might be an alien\nintelligence. If so, it would be only the third - and he would be a\nPioneer. \"Chandor, get the air-lock ready and make me a vac-suit.\nI'm going out.\"\n\"No!,\"\nhe heard Lynith cry. \"That might be dangerous.\"\n\"It\nmay not be relevant, but there was a perturbation during the passage of Delta\nAries,\" Chuntath said. \"We don't know what that ... thing\nis. Let one of us go.\"\n\"Please,\nI must go out.\" Then, frightened that his depression-induced\nparalysis might return he shouted, \"Chandor, I am the Lighthouse\nKeeper! I order you to obey!\"\nLimbs\ntrembling, thoughts jumbled, he ran to the floater shaft. Once down at\nthe air-lock level he stopped to draw several deep breaths. He had to\ncalm down. Even with the technology at his disposal it was hazardous\noutside.\nFloating\na meter above a dark surface of shattered and melted rock, interspersed\nwith frozen remnants of the primal atmosphere that had once stormed over\nthis little planet, Shastar paused to get his bearings. He saw a veil\npass between himself and the stars.\nA\nbillion fire-flies swirled about him and he felt terror nibbling at his\nresolve. He swung round. The Lighthouse, rooted in the bedrock, soared a\nkilometer high, dark amber in the glow of the far-off dwarf star. Made\nof a substance that could endure beyond the life of even this slow-burning\nsun, it was comforting.\n\"What\ndo you want?...\" he started, then broke off. Why should the thing\nbe able to understand his radio voice?\nIn\nthat instant a form solidified into being and he stood within a great\ncircle. Translucent vertical bars of rainbow color spun round him, each\nbar pulsing at a different harmonic rate. He clamped his jaws together\nto stop his mouth trembling.\nA\nrapid jumble of sounds, pictures, powerful emotional surges exploded\ninto his brain. Fleeting at first then an image lasted long enough to\nseize and hold in his mind's eye. An abstract swirl of colors which sent\nstrange chords flying along his nerves, in his mind it evoked the\nLighthouse. Acting on intuition, he superimposed a visualization of the\nmighty column. Shortly, it happened again. This time he felt and\nreflected back the starry bowl above him. And again, a great water\nocean, a woman sobbing, a barren moon, a fragment from Gasdrath's Dark\nSymphony.\nFor\na long time it continued, this wordless learning, as he thought of it.\nCommunication was hesitant, hobbled by errors and a dearth of mutual\nsymbols, but they progressed because this was his God-given talent and\njoy; in this field he was (had been, the stab came), a master. This was\nhow he had, long ago, realized his own creative works, not in a single\nperceptual frame, but through all the senses.\n-\nknowledge -\nIt\nwas an amalgam of sound, color, form, emotion - but he understood.\n\"Knowledge? About what? Who - what - are you? What is your\nname?\" Shastar asked.\n-\nname -\nA\nchaotic weave of tones and colors.\n-\nradiation ... source here ... cycles disordered ... great strength ...\ndesires ... needs ... needs -\nThe\nbeing's frantic begging for something vital, seen just beyond reach,\npulled at Shastar's every nerve. \"The vacuum-state transmission? I\ncan't tell you much. Technical details are Chuntath's field. Are you\nsaying the beam hurt you in some way?\"\nFor\na while there was silence and as Shastar waited he contemplated what he\ncould see, external to his mind, of the being. He could not grasp,\nwhole, the patterns of groups of patterns and circles within circles\nthat hinted at harmonies beyond human experience but he found\ncomposition such as he had approached, once.\n-\nweak now ... wave generation failing ... hoping ... journey radiation\nout -\n\"You\nmean, I must light the lamp so that you can follow the beam?\"\n-\nno ... form seen symbolic ... true self radiation ... needs ride energy\n-\n\"You\nare radiation yourself? Why do you want the beam then? If you need raw\nenergy, I can supply a generator.\" Shastar brooded. \"Wait, I\nthink I understand. Do you need to use the Lighthouse radiation as a\ncarrier wave?\"\n-\nyes ... no ... beam ... coherent ... not omnidirectional ... modulate -\n\"You\nneed a vacuum-state laser, a single frequency directional beam?\"\n-\nyes -\nThe\npositive was like a primary chord in his brain. He was dazzled and had\nto wait for the tones to die away before he could speak again. \"I\nwill have to discuss this with Chuntath. Such matters are outside my\nfield. Can you wait?\"\n-\nconcept unknown -\nShastar\nturned back towards the Lighthouse. Once inside he hurried to the\nObservation Room. Filled with a burning desire to help yet he was glad\nto be within these impervious walls. Standing at the windows he watched\nthe shadow.\n\"Chuntath,\ncan we help this being? Can we direct and filter the radiation from the\nLighthouse Lamp? From what you said, and its own statement, we are\nresponsible for its being marooned.\"\n\"No.\nThe Lamp's operation cannot be changed; it was built to withstand\nmeddling. No force I can exert will alter that. You, by your talent, can\ntune it to a single frequency, but that will not serve. You need not\nfeel guilty. Perhaps we were the immediate cause, but it was an most\nimprobable accident.\"\n\"That\nmay be so, but I do feel an obligation to help.\" Shastar gazed with\ngreat sadness at the restless phantom outside. He did not say so to\nChuntath but its loss of direction felt like his own. How long could it\nsurvive?\n\"Furthermore,\nif we refuse to try, would its kind not consider that a most unfriendly\nattitude on the part of mankind? Perhaps it is in communication with its\nkin even as we hesitate.\"\nFor\nhours he discussed the matter with Chuntath but no solution could be\nfound. At last he went to his rooms, his mood black as the night\noutside.\nFor\nthe first time in several years Shastar, dismayed at his inability to\nhelp, was intensely aware of the misery of another. But the universe was\nindifferent to such emotions. He felt a sudden sharp need for human\ncontact.\nA\nstarship could move faster than light but there was no such ship here;\nall he had was electromagnetic signals which crawled at light speed: the\nnearest human was eighteen years distant. His isolation from others of\nhis kind was total, in spirit and body, and for a moment his sanity\nwavered.\nThen\nShastar thought of Lynith. He was heterosexual and thus his Companion\nwas female but he had shunned her, the very thought of her, from the\ninstant he had heard of the concept of the Companion.\nShe was made, and he had once made beautiful and intricate\nthings.\nYet,\nalthough she was a machine, still her creators were human and she was\ncloser to his humanity than that intelligence outside could ever be.\nDesigned to be all things to all men, she could be, as needed,\ncolleague, friend, temptress, shameless wanton and more.\nBut, never a docile slave to be used.\nPeople that needed such outlets were not chosen as Lighthouse\nKeepers.\nHe\nlooked with aesthetic enjoyment at the slender figure, a single length\nof white cloth draped round her. Not biologically alive, no, yet in his\ndistress Shastar found in her the animation that he craved.\nHe\npoured out his concern for the alien, lost and wandering in a dark\nendless void. Intent, she listened as though his distress was important\nto her and he talked on and on. Hours later he stopped, silenced by the\nabrupt awareness that he had been speaking about Rantha. For a timeless\nspace Shastar faltered, a prisoner afraid of freedom. Lynith sat\nmotionless, her indigo blue gaze piercing him.\nThen,\ngathering all his courage, Shastar brought her to sit next to him and as\nher bright head nestled against his chest he went on, trying to forget\nhis qualms, for although the memory of Rantha was agony, he had to\nunburden himself now.\nThe\nthought came to him, and he could not dismiss it although it shamed him:\nto such as she, he need not prove anything, thus there might be for that\nvery reason, no failure. He took her into his arms and as he felt\nLynith's body warm and pliant under his hands it was easy to forget her\nnature. As she whispered his name Shastar felt himself swept away by a\nflood as old as life itself.\nAfterwards,\nas he rested, spent, he felt a flood of a different sort, yet one whose\nsource surely came from the same spring and suddenly he was restless\nwith the urge, the extreme necessity to create again.\nAt\nthat moment the concept came to Shastar and he forgot Lynith, so quiet\nbeside him. Obsessed by his thoughts he ran to the air-lock.\n\"Using\nwhat I know, what I sense of your being, I will try and compose music to\ndrive raw energy into a carrier wave that your structure can modulate.\nFirst, we need to define the parameters to follow in the physical\nbuilding of a beam generator before I can compose the software.\"\nShastar\nhesitated, then, \"I must warn you. My talent to sense the intrinsic\nquality of others has always been expressed only in terms of human\nneeds, thus there is no way of knowing if I will succeed with you.\"\n-\nfate ... hope -\n\"Tell\nme what frequency you need and how much power, and the direction.\"\nBut\nthis was difficult. He and the alien had no shared concepts of space and\nnumber. To Shastar the Universe was the Creator Manifest but to the\nother it was incidental standing waves from radiation transmitted by the\nPrimal Radiance. Only when Chuntath was called could benchmarks rooted\nin fundamental physics be established by meticulous reasoning. Then the\nnumbers were found and he could make his attempt.\nThe\ndevice would be quite small but he knew that the Lighthouse Keeper had\nnot the authority to make Chandor admit the alien to the Lighthouse. He\nhad to smile - it was doubtful that Emperor Narradan VI himself could\nforce Chandor, short of destroying him. No, it would have to be built\noutside.\nThe\nmachines that had constructed the Lighthouse twenty centuries before\nwere summoned from their sleep. They leveled twenty hectares of rock,\ncarved out a parabolic basin to ten nano-meter tolerance and sank seven\npits.\nSix, a meter across and two deep, marked 60 degree points on the\ndish circumference and the seventh, twice that size, was in the center.\nSix vacuum-state generators, six slender towers and a 5 gigawatt fusion\nreactor completed an array directed at a point in space defined by\ncoordinates 22 hours, 34 minutes, 8 seconds Right Accession and -79\ndegrees, 52 minutes South Declination.\nHe\nworked for fourteen Earth Standard Days. Of food he knew little and then\nonly when Lynith made him eat. Once during that time a starship passed\nand he had to dance his way round the fiery columns. He did it without\nworry or elation and begrudged the time of rest that followed.\nWhen\nit was finished Shastar went outside and waited till the circle of light\nformed round him.\n\"I\ndo not know if the device will carry you.\" He felt subdued.\n\"The music I have written might not modulate the vacuum-state\nradiation generator correctly, and, from your side, if you cannot harmonize\nwith my composition, well - you may be destroyed.\"\n-\nhome-coming ... joy ... extinction ... release -\n\"We\nmust start when this constellation,\" Shastar said, matching his\nwords with a mental picture of a star pattern, \"is in the ascendant.\"\nEarly\nthe next 'day' Shastar stood at an observation window and watched a\nshadow wavering between the towers far below. When the holograph beside\nhim showed the correct alignment of stars was at hand he raised his\nhands. It was more prayer than signal. Chuntath did not need his\nsupervision, and once initiated, control was automatic via feed-back\nloops between Shastar's music and the gravity patterns.\nIn\nthe absence of air, for perhaps ten minutes there was nothing to see,\nbut as the stupendous energies grew the rock began to crumble and dust\nmotes made the laser beams visible. Soon an orchestra of light was\nweaving a polychromatic overture as the vacuum-state force fields\nunfolded. And the alien danced as well: its luminous circles spun within\nthe fence of towers and synchrotron radiation dimmed the stars.\nThe\nalien, its pattern frozen into a standing wave that appeared motionless,\nwas rotating in a torrent of power. Now, like a miniature sun, streams\nof fire arced upwards and bursts of incandescence etched the hills\nagainst the black of space.\nThe\nvacuum-state radiation modulated by Shastar's music, as in a maser, was\na solid pillar of blinding light when the very fabric of space became\nconductive and the pathway opened. At that critical instant the\nintrinsic theme of the alien's life force harmonized with the music\nShastar had composed. The alien was flung starward in a soundless\nexplosion that made even the Lighthouse shudder. A nova lived and died.\nEven\nthough the window glass had compensated, the brilliance had been almost\nbeyond bearing. Now, except for the glow from the pool of molten rock it\nwas black again outside. Dazed, trembling and elated, Shastar went to\nhis garden to ponder the consequences. He found Lynith waiting for him,\nand with her he celebrated his rebirth through the days that remained of\nhis duty here.\nThe\nlast hour arrived. Beside him floated a crystal data bank that held all\nhe and Chuntath knew about the alien.\nBeside\nhim also, was Lynith, serene as ever, so nearly human as to defy the\ndistinction. He studied her with an artist's eye. Surely, she was the\nfinest thing the science and art of Empire had ever made.\nShashtar\ntouched her cheek. \"Lynith, the next Lighthouse Keeper will be here\nsoon. One human is much like any other, to your kind, not so?\"\nThe\nhead of burnished hair bent and she trembled, then grew still and lifted\nher face to look at him.\n\"Yes,\nmy friend, one human is the same as another to us.\"\nBut\nthe knowledge that he could create again was an exaltation raising him\nbeyond any other concern. Rescuing the alien, becoming a Contact\nPioneer, a triumphal return to society. All these were peripheral. One\nlight outshone all: he had found himself again.\n---- END ----\nBernie\nAckerman was born and raised in Transvaal, South Africa, where he\nstill resides.

Snider\n\u00a9 2000\nEditor's Note: This story (written by your\nhumble webmaster) was originally published in the webzine\nDemensions (no relation, and\nno, that's not a typo).\nThe hill commanded a magnificent view of Happiness City, on the\nmoon-world of Hesperia. The new town\u2019s plump, prefab houses were arranged in\npatterns hypnotic to the eye when seen from a distance.\nThe River Jaylam traced its sinuous route through the heart of the\ncity, reflecting the white wings of the kabuki birds as they twisted and\nspiraled over its waters. The\nisabella trees, genetically engineered to grow only in this fertile valley,\nswayed lazily in the warm breeze, their leaves dancing and glistening in the\nsunlight. The gas-giant Magnus,\nthree times the mass of Sol\u2019s Jupiter, filled one quarter of the\nnoonday\nsky; its cloud-bands alive with powerful, churning hurricanes of yellow, purple,\nand tan; its slowly changing patterns freckled with tiny disk-shadows,\nindicating the presence of other satellite worlds.\nShakey\nHavkak sat on that hill, with easel, canvas, and brush - painting a banana.\nHe used a considerable amount of blue (having long since run out of\nyellow during his previous rendering of an eggplant).\nHavkak\nruminated on his current assignment as he waited patiently for the paint to dry.\nThe Guys Upstairs had decided to drop the Big One on Happiness City \u2013\non the whole moon, in fact. Strictly\ntop secret, of course. Predictive\nanalyses showed that the gentle folk of Hesperia would almost certainly vote for\nthe Opposition in the next election, and it wouldn\u2019t do to have a disaffected\nelectorate mucking up the business of Government.\nSo, before the tragic and \u201caccidental\u201d demise of this tranquil little\nworld, the Guys Upstairs wanted to do the fiscally responsible thing and collect\non delinquent accounts \u2013 while the collecting was good.\nThence\ncame Shakey Havkak.\nHavkak was a Servant of the Bureaucracy who had risen up through the ranks with\nalarming regularity. He possessed the uncanny ability of obtaining - through\nlogic, coercion, or pillage \u2013 overdue funds from citizens who had the\nstaggering shortsightedness of putting their own petty interests above the\nne\u2019er-ending necessities of the State.\nBeing\na conscientious civil servant, he\u2019d arrived a day early and (per policy)\nchecked into one of the seedier establishments on Hesperia, where he would be\nperceived as taking less dubious advantage of the public\u2019s generous, if not\naltogether voluntary, goodwill. After a good night\u2019s sleep and a greasy breakfast, he had\nrented a nice cherry-red Grav-A Convertible (disappointed that the economy\nmodels were already taken) and headed for the overlook, where he had spent the\nmorning in creative mode. Having\nthus girded himself for the day, he would spend the afternoon fleecing\nunsuspecting (but he was sure ultimately thankful) customers, taking the red-eye\nout of Happiness City a few days before it would be stricken from the political\nmap.\n#\nHavkak\ngathered up his stuff, carefully placing the unfinished portrait in the trunk of\nthe vert. His first stop this\nafternoon would be a visit to one Mr. DeLano, a wealthy accountant who lived in\na spacious customfab on the other side of the hills.\nThis unannounced appointment would score big-time credits for the Office,\nand would further solidify Havkak\u2019s reputation as a ruthless remora for the\nState.\nAs\nHavkak arrived at the DeLano residence, he was greeted by a furious commotion.\nMr. DeLano was running repeatedly from the house to the family sedan and\nback, each time carrying a hastily gathered armload of possessions. The car hovered on four grav units, which whined in\never-rising tones as lamps, books, clothes, toys, appliances, and other\nbric-a-brac were crammed into the trunk and back seat.\nTwo household droids whirred and sputtered in DeLano\u2019s wake, nervously\nsnatching up any kibble or morsel of debris that happened to fall from his\noverburdened arms.\nMrs.\nDeLano kept their two jabbering children in check, as the family fox terrier\norbited Mr. DeLano, barking and slapping the ground with her front paws,\ntripping him up and biting at his pant legs.\n\u201cAh,\nMr. DeLano,\u201d opened Havkak, sticking to protocol.\n\u201cGood afternoon! Shakey Havkak, Servant of the Bureaucracy, Department of\nRevenue, Office of Delinquent Collections - at your service.\u201d He extended his right hand expectantly.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nshot DeLano over his shoulder as he again headed for the house.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding! We\u2019re\ngetting the hell outta here! Haven\u2019t\nyou heard?\u201d\n\u201cHeard?\u201d\nHavkak blinked nervously, unsure of what to do with his unrequited hand.\n\u201cHeard what?\u201d\n\u201cGood\nGod, man! The Guys Upstairs are\ngonna tap a Big One \u2013 right here on H-City!\nSomebody leaked it! Now the\nOpposition newsfeed says they\u2019ve moved up the timetable.\nA Force cruiser will hit orbit any minute now.\nThe spaceport\u2019s jammed, but I got a private...\u201d DeLano cleared his\nthroat. \u201cAnyway, mister, I got a lot\nmore to worry about than some damned audit.\nYou better get the hell outta here, too, if you know what\u2019s good for\nyou!\u201d DeLano went back into\naction.\nHavkak\nstammered, uncertain as to how to proceed in the face of this unexpected glitch\nin the anticipated routine. \u201cA leak? Oh my\n\u2013 that\u2019s not supposed to happen! It\n- it can\u2019t happen! I\u2019ve got \u2013 I assure you, Mr. DeLano, this will only take\na few minutes...\u201d\nDeLano\u2019s\nmouth fell open incredulously. \u201cGet\nlost, mister! I don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d\nHe looked at his wife in exasperation.\n\u201cOh, screw it. Honey, get\nthe kids in the car.\u201d\nHavkak\nwas flummoxed. He had seldom been\npresented with such a persistently uncooperative customer.\n\u201cMr. DeLano, I am authorized, as a Servant of the Bureaucracy, to\ncollect on your delinquent account \u2013 today.\nIf you attempt to avoid your obligation, I do\nhave the means of forcing the issue.\u201d\nDeLano\nlaughed. \u201cForce away, Ace!\nWe\u2019re gone!\u201d With that,\nhe hopped into the sedan, its grav units wailing, and began backing out toward\nthe road.\n\u201cOh\ndear,\u201d muttered Havkak. He\nremoved a portable commlink from his vest pocket.\nHe tapped a few quick commands, and the DeLano family car stalled, the\ngrav units slowly dying, bringing the massive load to rest on the driveway.\nDespite\nthe presence of his children, DeLano let fly an ear-searing progression of\nexpletives - some threatening, some amusing, most anatomically improbable.\nHe paused only to reload with ragged gulps of air.\nHavkak\nshook his head ruefully. \u201cMr. DeLano. You\nforced my hand. I\u2019ve been granted\naccess to your operator\u2019s license and vehicle registration accounts.\nAs of now, both are suspended, and will remain so until our business is\nconcluded. Now, if you\u2019ll just\nstep inside for a moment...\u201d\nDeLano\nexploded from the car, his face scarlet, launching an indecipherable cacophony\nof gibberish in Havkak\u2019s direction. It\nsounded like Standard English, but it\nwas more strung together, and accompanied by far more guttural sounds and\nspittle, than is customary during civilized discourse.\nMrs.\nDeLano, apparently the brains in the family, pulled the children from the sedan\nand stood in the middle of the yard, looking perplexed.\nHavkak\nwas unimpressed, having endured similar encounters in the past.\n\u201cTisk, tisk, Mr. DeLano. Please,\ndon\u2019t make me call the police.\u201d\n\u201cThe\npolice!\u201d shrieked DeLano.\n\u201cThey were the first to bail! They\u2019re\nprobably on the other side of Magnus by now!\u201d\nSuddenly DeLano glanced over Havkak\u2019s shoulder.\nMrs. DeLano was pointing furtively at the rented Grav-A Convertible.\nDeLano\nrelaxed and smiled, taking Havkak by the arm.\n\u201cTell you what, Mister \u2013 Havkak, is it?\nWhy don\u2019t you seize my estate \u2013 right here, right now?\nHow\u2019s that? Surely enough\nto cover the delta, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d\nDeLano faced Havkak, grasping him by the shoulders, holding him at\narm\u2019s length.\nHavkak\nwas pleasantly taken aback. Now, that\u2019s more like\nit. \u201cWhy, I...\u201d\nAt\nthat moment, DeLano feinted right, dodged left, and was behind Havkak before he\ncould reply. DeLano high-stepped it\nacross the lawn and leaped into the driver\u2019s side of the vert, dragging the\nkids in after him. Mrs. DeLano\nvaulted, with surprising agility, into the passenger\u2019s seat.\nTrailing\ntwin vortices of dust, the vert shot away, outdistancing the pursuing fox\nterrier as it topped the hill.\nHavkak\nwas stunned. Such\nimpertinence! Well, if the\npolice were not available, he, as a loyal civil servant, was duty-bound to give\npursuit.\nHe\ntapped the appropriate commands into the link, reactivating the DeLanos\u2019\nsedan. It whirred to life, but this\ntime the grav units protested, unable to gain the momentum to lift the car off\nthe driveway.\nHe\ndropped the link in the grass and began throwing objects from the back seat.\nBy now the terrier was back, going to work on Havkak\u2019s pants as he\ndesperately tried to lighten the load enough to get mobile.\nThe\nhousehold droids went into action again, whizzing about, reloading the car even\nmore neatly than before. Havkak objected, but after a while the droids refused to let\nhim near the car, silently shooing him off by flapping their metallic arms.\nHavkak\nthrew his hands up in defeat. Retrieving\nhis commlink from the lawn, he trotted down the road, harassed by the terrier,\nback toward town.\n#\nHours\nlater, as evening approached, he found himself, winded, sweating, caked in dust\nand grit, on the same hilltop where he\u2019d spent the morning.\nMagnus loomed oppressively overhead.\nHe could barely hear the honking horns of the cars, far below, headlights\nflashing, crawling slowly out of the city.\nHe saw shuttles rising over the hills on the opposite side of the city,\ngleaming in the setting sun, escaping on columns of smoke.\nIn\nan instant, the sky began to boil.\n\u201cOh\ndear,\u201d chided Shakey, as Armageddon marched across the valley.\nEND\nBack to\nOriginal Fiction","source":null,"source-hostname":null,"excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/t4XWjIr+tAPJuie8J+1b-BbM3ek.json"}

I had to lead him home and then saddle his brother Ezekiel, who is not quite as swift a steed.\"\n\"It matters little,\" the Reverend Hugh Bolton said with a tight little smile. \"A proceeding of this gravity cannot commence without the presence of the whole tribunal. We would scarce have begun without you, Brother.\" The barely veiled sarcasm was Bolton's idea of subtlety. Glancing in his direction, Hopkin thought that Bolton's black robe and ample girth made him look like a fat crow -- the kind you see perched atop the gallows, eager for fresh meat.\n\"Would not your life be made easier if you lived within Salem proper, Matthew?\" Roger Dufrain asked mildly. \"You could spare yourself such a long journey each day.\" At 30, Roger was the junior of the three judges, and his unlined face with its ruddy complexion emphasized his relative youth. Some among the people thought that, in his robes of office, Roger resembled a choir boy -- an opinion that was widely shared but never spoken aloud.\n\"The Lord did not intend for our lives to be easy, Brother Roger,\" Hopkin replied while hastily donning his own regalia. \"Else He would not have sent The Great Fire to test us. Besides,\" he added with a slight smile, \"the daily ride to and fro is my only chance for the quiet contemplation that seems to elude me elsewhere.\" Dufrain returned the smile -- he knew that Hopkin had six children at home.\n\"Well, the matter pending should not detain us long,\" Bolton declared. \"The girl is clearly guilty.\"\nHopkin stopped buttoning his robe and turned slowly to stare at Bolton. The Chief Magistrate's blue eyes were icy, although his voice was deceptively mild, at first. \"Well God save us, Brother Hugh, I wish you had included that information in the summons that brought me all this way in such haste. We hardly need put ourselves through the trouble of swearing witnesses and examining evidence, since the Reverend Hugh Bolton, with the wisdom we normally accord only to the Lord God Almighty, has already determined the outcome of the case!\"\nBolton flinched in the face of such vehemence. \"I -- I only meant that the facts seem clear. After all, there was enough evidence to order the warrant for a search. You did sign it yourself.\"\n\"Aye, I did, and with good reason. However, a warrant is one thing, my Brother, and proof of guilt quite another. Otherwise, all that we three do in presiding over this court is but a sham, a mockery of God's justice.\" Hopkin took a step forward, then another. He stood barely an arm's length from Bolton, now, and his voice was dangerously quiet as he said, \"And I will have no part in such a mockery -- not today, not tomorrow, not ever. Is that abundantly clear to you, Brother?\"\n\"Yes, yes, of course it is, I meant no . . . that is, I never mean --\"\n\"Perhaps we might prepare to take the bench, my Brothers,\" Dufrain said calmly. \"The people await us, as they have done for some little time, now.\"\nHopkin took in a deep breath, expelled it, and let the anger fade from his face and voice. Still staring into Bolton's porcine face, he said, \"As usual, our younger Brother speaks sensibly.\" He stepped back from Bolton, glad to be away from the rancid odor of the man's breath. Settling his Chief Magistrate's robe more comfortably on his shoulders, Hopkin said, \"Come then, my Brothers. Let us do our duty, as God is our judge. For, surely, He will be.\"\n###\n\". . . and it was shortly after ten of the clock that my sister's fever broke, God be praised. I stayed a while longer, but then she bid me return home to care for my own family. So it was just shy of midnight that I walked past that girl's window and heard the Devil's voice.\"\n\"Your pardon for a moment, Goodwife,\" Hopkin said. Then, turning his head, he called out,\n\"Bailiff, the daylight grows faint. Be so good as to have the lamps lit.\"\nA few moments later, as the oil lamps bestowed upon the courtroom their flickering light and distinctive odor, Hopkin asked the witness, \"What gave you to think it was the voice of the Devil, and not simply an ordinary man speaking within the house?\"\nGoodwife Trixie Abbandando frowned in thought. \"The tone of it, Your Lordship. It were not like the voice of a living man,\" she said finally. \"It sounded . . . tinny, and far away, like. I knew right off something was not right about it.\"\n\"And what did you do then?\" This was from Dufrain.\n\"What any Christian would do. I crept to the window, stood on the very tips of my toes, and peeked inside.\"\n\"What did you see?\" Dufrain asked.\n\"I saw that girl, that Susan Bright --\" She pointed an accusing finger toward the dock \"-- sitting at a small desk, at which a candle burned. Before her, she had an infernal device, a wicked tool of Satan. It was from there that the voice came forth.\"\n\"And what did it say, this Devilish voice?\" Bolton asked. \"What evil thing did you overhear?\"\nThe witness hesitated. \"Well, I could not make out any word, Your Lordship. I were too far away.\" Her voice hardened. \"But I saw the wicked thing clearly, and I know this much: the apple tree produces\nnaught but apples, and never will. The mouth of Satan does not bring forth the Gospel.\"\n\"Please, Goodwife Abbandando, restrict yourself to the facts, as you witnessed them,\" Hopkin said gently. \"Leave the interpretation to others. Now, tell the court what you did after you saw what the accused was doing.\"\n\"Why, I continued on home, fast as my two legs could carry me. Told my husband what I'd seen, soon as I was inside the door. He said I must tell the Court of it, straight away. So, first thing the next morn, I did.\"\nHopkin glanced at each of his fellow judges in turn. Seeing that neither had more questions, he told the witness, \"Be so good as to rise and approach the evidence table.\"\nAs Trixie Abbandando stood at the long table that ranged in front of the judges' bench, Hopkin asked her, \"Do you see before you the device you first spied in Susan Bright's bedroom?\"\nA number of objects were arranged upon the table, but the woman pointed to one without hesitation, although she did not allow her finger to actually come in contact with it. \"This is it here, Your Lordship. This is the Devil's tool I saw!\"\nShe had indicated a rectangle of wood, about ten inches by seven. Upon it were affixed several small metal objects of different sizes connected to each other by bits of thin, insulated wire. The three judges looked at the object with interest. So did many of the spectators, who remained in their seats but craned their necks to see.\nThe witness was dismissed. Over the next two hours, the court heard from several others.\nThe Sheriff who executed the search warrant described the results of the raid on the Brights' home, pointing to the evidence table several times in explaining what he and his deputies had seized.\nNeighbors of the Brights testified as to how they might have heard unusual sounds coming from the accused's household, but weren't certain. The witnesses' answers were carefully calculated for their own protection -- to deny any knowledge at all might leave them open to criticism if the girl were convicted; to admit suspicion of her activities could bring punishment for not reporting it voluntarily.\nThe girl's parents were called, each in turn. They both denied any knowledge of Susan's possession of the infernal device. But they also refused to condemn their daughter, saying that she was a God-fearing child who, if she had sinned, had done so from the foolishness of youth, not evil intent.\nHopkin found that he rather liked them for that.\nThen it was time to question the accused herself.\nSusan Bright, all of sixteen years old, was sworn and duly seated. Her reddish-brown hair was swept back from a face that might be beautiful one day. Her gray eyes were blinking rapidly, and she gripped the arms of the witness chair tightly, as if to keep her hands from trembling. She was clearly terrified.\nAs well she might be, Hopkin thought. This business could cost her the highest price there is. In this world, at least.\nHopkin led off the questioning, as was customary.\n\"Susan,\" he said gently, \"You have heard Sheriff O'Bannion testify how he did discover that --\" he gestured toward the device \"--in your room. Do you deny that it was there?\"\n\"No, Your Lordship.\" Her voice trembled a little.\n\"And you have also heard Goodwife Abbandando swear that she saw you use it to coax forth voices. Do you deny this?\"\n\"No, Your Lordship, I do not.\"\nThis caused murmuring among the spectators, which Hopkin silenced with a glare. Turning back to the witness, he asked sternly, \"Do you therefore admit to being in league with the Devil?\"\nThe girl began to shake her head to and fro, saying, \"No, Your Lordship, no, never! I have\nnaught to do with the Evil One, or with any of his works!\"\nHopkin leaned back in his chair, signaling to Bolton that he might take up the interrogation.\nPeering at the witness with his piggy eyes, Bolton said slyly, \"This instrument you were seen using, when did the Devil give it to you?\"\n\"The Devil never give it to me, Your Lordship! Never!\"\n\"How then did you come by it?\"\n\"It were my brother's. I found it one day, among his things.\"\n\"Your brother! What is his name? Is he in this courtroom?\"\n\"His name is -- was -- Jonathan, Your Lordship. He died last year, of the cholera.\"\n\"Dead is he? How very convenient!\" Bolton's sarcasm was as ponderous as his wit. \"How do you propose we question this brother of yours, then -- through necromancy? Has the Devil taught you that forbidden art, as well?\"\n\"I know nothing of necromancy! I know not even what it is! I have no truck with the Devil!\" The girl began to weep softly.\nBolton drew breath to speak. but Hopkin touched his arm lightly. The fat man subsided, looking like a spoiled child being denied a third piece of cake.\nHopkin waited for the girl to compose herself, then nodded to Dufrain.\n\"So, you believe the device belonged to your late brother?\" Dufrain's voice was clear and calm, with no hint of Bolton's theatrics.\n\"Yes, Your Lordship.\"\n\"Know you how he may have come by it?\"\nSusan Bright hesitated. \"I -- I think mayhap he did build it, Your Lordship.\"\nThere was more murmuring, which Hopkin again stifled with a stern look.\nDufrain paid the spectators no heed. \"How could a mere boy fashion a device such as that?\"\n\"He told me he had found a book, your Lordship. In the ruins of an old house, out in the countryside.\"\n\"The Devil's book!\" cried a woman from the third row of seats.\nHopkin banged his gavel once, loudly. \"This court will be in good order,\" he said sternly, \"or this court will be cleared!\"\nOnce calm had been restored, Dufrain asked the girl, \"Can you identify the book your brother used? Is it among these here?\" He gestured toward the evidence table, on which rested several volumes seized from the Bright home.\nShe approached the table as if it had teeth and claws. Glancing up at Hopkin, she received a nod of encouragement, and stepped closer. After only a moment's perusal of the stack of books, she picked one out. \"This is the one, your Lordship. Jonathan said he found the knowledge in here to build the device. He said it was something called a . . . a rah-DEE-o.\"\nThe word was repeated in a dozen or more muttered remarks before Hopkin gaveled the courtroom quiet. He bid Susan Bright return to the witness chair, and signaled to Dufrain that he wanted to take up the questioning again himself.\n\"Even if you did not make or procure this device yourself, Susan, why did you employ it to listen to the Devil's voice?\"\n\"I had never touched it afore that night, your Lordship. I knew not how to operate it, but I must have touched something in error, for suddenly there was this voice that came from it. I was so surprised, I just sat there before it, listening.\"\n\"Do you not know the danger of giving attention to the words of Satan, child?\" Hopkin's voice was not unkind.\n\"But they could not have been Satan's words, your Lordship,\" she protested. \"It were a man's voice, true. But it were praying -- praying to the Lord Jesus. . . .\"\n###\n\"The poor twit of a girl meant no harm. She used bad judgment in keeping her brother's little toy rather than turning it over to proper authority, but methinks she is no more a worshipper of Satan than I am.\"\nThe courtroom was empty, except for the three magistrates. It had been so for nearly two hours as they deliberated.\n\"I tried my best to break her, as you saw, but she never abandoned her account,\" the Reverend Hugh Bolton went on. \"Some small chastisement may be in order. Mayhap the father should be instructed to take a strap to her, redden her buttocks so that she must take her meals standing for a week. But even such as that may be unnecessary -- the trial itself has taught her a valuable lesson already, I'll wager.\"\n\"Before court, you had declared her already tried and convicted, Hugh,\" Hopkin said quietly.\nThe big man shrugged uncomfortably. \"As you rightly pointed out, Matthew, my judgment was too hasty. I had failed, although briefly, to pay heed to the oath we all have sworn. But the evidence seems clear, now.\" He shook his head solemnly. \"There be no witchcraft here -- just a silly girl who chanced upon a dangerous plaything.\"\n\"The evidence supports no such notion,\" Roger Dufrain snapped. His boyish face was set sternly. \"The girl knew the dangers, yet she willingly ignored them. She deliberately invoked the demon Technology.\"\nDufrain walked to the evidence table and picked up the book that Susan Bright had identified in court. \"See you here,\" he said, pointing to the cover illustration. It showed an adolescent boy holding a thin glass tube with a rounded bottom. The boy was staring raptly at the tube, which was partly full of some liquid that bubbled fiercely and emitted a stream of smoke. Above the image were printed the words, \"101 Science Projects.\"\n\"The covering itself shows the book's intent,\" Dufrain proclaimed. \"What does this painting manifest, if not the conjuring of a demon? How could the girl gaze upon such an image and not know the black work such 'projects' must involve?\"\nDufrain returned the book to the table and sat down again, facing the other two. \"You know the law, and the reasons therefor.\" His voice was quiet again, but charged with passionate conviction.\n\"We are all well versed in the law, brother,\" Hopkin said. \"That is why we have been entrusted by God with administering it.\"\n\"Then leave us not forget why the law exists. The Great Burning, as our forefathers have recorded, destroyed all the world but this tiny corner. Fire and disease and deadly gasses ravaged the land, everywhere but here. God spared Salem for a reason, my brothers.\"\n\"We know the Gospel of Richard as well as you do, Brother Roger,\" Bolton said, frowning. \"You need not preach it to us.\"\nDufrain held up a hand, palm outward. \"I mean not to offend, I would not do so for all the world.\" He dropped his hand and leaned forward. \"But I fear for our people, left alone amid this destroyed world. If the Devil gains a foothold among us, where can we flee? Twenty-five leagues beyond Salem, the water becomes poisonous, the air unbreathable. And deadly creatures await the unwary -- the demon Radiation, the witch Sarin, the serpent Anthrax, and all the others.\"\nDufrain stood, walked across the courtroom to a nearby cabinet, and removed a large parchment from one of its drawers. Returning to the others, he unfurled it to display a map labeled\n\"Normerica.\"\n\"Behold Salem, our home,\" he said. \"And beyond, what did the wise mapmakers write here --\" he pointed with a jabbing finger \"-- and here, and here, also. Of what do they warn us?\"\n\"'Here be dragons,'\" Hopkin read, his voice sounding weary. \"You impart nothing we did not learn in childhood, Brother.\"\nDufrain tossed the map aside and resumed his seat. \"But can we then ignore the implications of what we have learned?\"\nHopkin looked at his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 with narrowed eyes, \"And these implications would be....\"\n\"That we must be vigilant, always, against the Devil's infestations. For if he once gains disciples in this community, if the Lord should see that his mercy in sparing us was for\nnaught....\" Dufrain shook his head, as if in contemplating unimaginable catastrophe. \"No, the girl is guilty, my brothers, and she must burn, for the sake of her soul. And for the sake of all of us.\"\nThere was silence in the great room. Finally, Bolton said, \"Much though I respect my younger Brother's fervor, I cannot but think him overzealous and misguided in this particular matter. My vote remains unchanged.\"\nThe two of them looked at Hopkin for a long moment, before Bolton continued, \"That puts it up to you, Brother Matthew.\"\n###\nThe hour was late, but Matthew Hopkin remained in the courtroom, alone. He had sent Bolton and Dufrain home some time ago, desiring solitude for his contemplation. \"Return here in the morning, at\nseven of the clock,\" he'd told them. \"You shall have my decision then.\"\nThe case was troubling to him. He found himself inclined toward leniency, but he wondered whether this might spring from his reluctance to send a young, pretty girl to the stake.\nAlthough he personally found executions repugnant and never attended them, Hopkin had signed death warrants before. Were he unwilling to do so on principle, he would never have accepted appointment to the bench. But Hopkin's eldest daughter bore a passing resemblance to Susan Bright, and he worried that this might be influencing him.\nIt was almost four in the morning before the truth suddenly came to him, like lightning from Heaven. He pondered it for several minutes, then pared his discovery down to its barest essentials: \"If the opinions of my Brother Magistrates had been reversed, would it have made a difference to me? If Bolton, a fatuous ass, had called for the girl's death, would I have disagreed, on principle? If Roger Dufrain, who is young but possessed of both intelligence and integrity, had urged acquittal, would I not even now be asleep in my bed?\"\nHopkin smacked his knees with his open palms and stood. \"Answer: Yes. Yes. And, again, Yes.\" He never realized that he had been speaking aloud.\nHopkin yawned, then stretched some of the kinks out of his shoulders. His spirit was calm now. The girl would be set free, with a stern warning to avoid anything that bore even a whiff of forbidden Technology. Hopkin thought that even Bolton's suggested whipping would be unnecessary.\nIt was too late to return home for even a few hours' sleep, and too early to obtain breakfast anywhere. He would simply have to pass the time until the rest of the village began stirring.\nAnother yawn creaked Hopkin's jawbone. He wandered over to the evidence table, which still bore the items that had been introduced in the trial. He glanced at a few of the innocuous books, making a mental note to have them returned to the Brights tomorrow. A small pile of handwritten affidavits sat nearby, and he flipped through them idly.\nThe only other item was the radio.\nFoolish looking thing, really, Hopkin thought. He wondered where the boy Jonathan had found the bits and parts that had gone into the making of it. Manufacture of such things had been forbidden since The Great Fire, and no one alive these days would possess either the materials or the knowledge, God be praised.\nMayhap the boy found the pieces in the same place he discovered the book. We should ask the girl Susan if her brother revealed the location to her. That house should be found, if possible, and burned to the ground, the rubble covered with earth.\nHe picked up the piece of wood on which the \"radio\" was mounted. Such things ought to be --\n\" -- make contact with communities of survivors throughout the Eastern United States, or what was once the United States, and, we hope, will be again.\"\nHopkin gaped. He had barely touched the thing, and yet this thin male voice was suddenly coming from it. He stood as if paralyzed, listening to the faint but understandable words that issued from the strange device.\n\"We have now established radio contact with communities in Portland, Maine, Durham, New Hampshire, Cape Cod, Massachusetts, New Haven, Connecticut, and Scranton, Pennsylvania. We hope to increase the power of our transmissions soon, and, with God's help, get in touch with other isolated cities, and towns, and even groups of people who have managed to get their hands on an old radio and find a way to power it with solar batteries or wind turbines or something similar. This is radio station WPAX, Kingston, Rhode Island.\"\nThe speaker paused, and took an audible breath before continuing. \"And we have more good news to report tonight -- a party of eight men from New Haven arrived here yesterday, after traveling through areas formerly thought to be impassible due to radiation and other lingering CBW poisons of the war. It would appear, the Lord be praised, that the terrible effects of that time are finally lifting, which should allow us to eventually link up with other communities and end the terrible isolation which has --\"\nThe voice began to fade, then disappeared completely. The room was again silent, so quiet that Hopkins could hear his pulse pounding in is ears.\nHis mind could barely contain all that he had heard. He face formed a beatific smile, the like of which had not been seen there since the day of his ordination into the ministry.\nThink of it! The Lord had spared others besides the people of Salem and its environs. And they were using Technology -- not to worship Satan but to communicate in a Godly way, one with another. And the land beyond Salem was becoming livable again, which meant . . . .\nHopkin's smile melted like a snowflake on a hot stove.\nStrangers would come to Salem, after all this time. People with new ideas, foreign ways, unfamiliar modes of speech and . . . different religions?\nThe good people of Salem would be tempted by these things. Some might find them more attractive than the gray conformity that the Church imposed to keep God's people from straying into sin, the kind of sin that had caused the world's destruction in the first place.\nExcept it seemed that the world had not been completely destroyed, after all. One of the central tenets of the Faith, that God had preserved Salem, and Salem alone, would be proven to be a lie.\nAnd what then?\nWhat would happen to the Church, its teachings, its traditions, its power, its Ministers?\nMinisters like Hopkin.\nHe looked with new understanding at the device he held. He had been fooled -- yes, even a righteous man like himself could be fooled into thinking that this was an innocent toy. But now the scales had fallen from Hopkin's eyes. He knew that he was holding the Devil's handiwork.\nHe raised the radio above his head and smashed it down onto the table's edge, breaking it in two and picking up the pieces and one by one smashing them also and when they were too small to break further, jumping upon them where they lay on the floor then grinding the bits with the heel of his boot until there was nothing recognizable left, nothing dangerous, nothing at all.\nHopkin stood bent over, his hands braced on the evidence table, his breath coming in gasps like a man who has just been chased for miles by a savage beast.\nAfter a few minutes he straightened, wiped his brow, then brushed a few errant splinters from his sleeve. He picked up his cloak, put it on, then went around the courtroom extinguishing the oil lamps. He left the one nearest the door until last.\nIf the girl were acquitted, it would be only a matter of time before someone else began to tinker with the Devil's tools, with disastrous results for the people of Salem -- and for those who ruled them.\nWhen he met with Dufrain and Bolton, he would vote \"guilty,\" and that would be that. The invasion by the wicked world outside would be held at bay, perhaps indefinitely.\nThe girl would burn today, and, as penance for his own sin of pride, Hopkin would make himself watch. In the meantime, he desperately needed fresh air.\nHe opened the courthouse door and went out, into the dark.\n\"Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven.\"\n--John Milton, Paradise Lost\n---- END ----\nJustin\nGustainis is a college professor living in upstate New York.\nHe writes\nfiction as a way to avoid grading undergraduate term papers.

No matter where ya' look, the future seems to be a pretty bleak place to live. It ain't. So relax.\nThere still ain't no flyin' cars, no androids walkin' around killin' people. People ain't livin' under ground! We've not been forced to live on the moon or Mars! There're no mutants, monsters, or\naliens...well, no aliens you gotta worry any about.\nSo, what is the future like?\nShit, it's fuckin' rippin'! I love it here! Today, on the news\n- and believe me, there are hun'erds of t.v. stations t' choose from, but I turned to CNN-Q2 (Yeah, all 'em mergers an' takeovers an' digital channel thingos have given a lotta stations some funky names; my favorite's WB2LI1xTNT-TV. I don't know, so don't ask\nme) - well, on the news, they showed a picture of some old guy. Said he was one hun'erd eight years old. Not \"a hun'erd and eight.\" That's not how you say it. One hun'erd eight! Yeah, one \"o\" eight, and he died. Guess what?\n- and I love this - he was \"the last livin' 'hippie'!\" Is that the coolest thing y'ever heard!? The guy dies, and an entire bullshit culture goes with him. I mean, okay, he was a 'yuppie' after he was a 'hippie,' but to some degree we'll always have them damn 'yuppies.' And, I guess, kids'll always wear tie-dyed shirts. But it's officially over now.\nSee, they brought me to the future 'causea one thing: some fossil I found. Turns out the fossil is from the future\n- sorta - and through a whole big loada time-travel crap with scientists, some crazy woman, and a flyin' ship, I got here.\nThe fossil was from an animal nobody knew existed. Apparently this nutbrain future lady wanted it that way, so she came back to my time an' buried the thing. So me, diggin' a well for some farmer, I find it. And I keep it, make a few calls. Nobody'd ever heard of anything like this. It was some sort of lizard with little useless wings and, they said,\nhair - like a mammal. Now even I know that don't make no sense. Anyways, I learned that this thing was livin' in the rain forests, for like years they say. And it has a cure for a disease that attacks your\nres - respite - shit. Breathing...it tightens up your throat, filling it quick-like with gobs an' gobs a mucus, and in forty-eight hours, you can't breathe. You die painful. Sometimes people die faster'n that. I'd heard one person who got it severe? And he died in three hours.\nI saw it all happen in front of my face once. On the first trip\n\"forwards\"- you know, like in Time.\nIt was on the New York subway - well, at a stop. And this guy was apparently headin' to a hospital with his friend, 'cause they realized he was in the last, um, stages, of the disease, right?\nSo a guy saying he was a doctor - and after you hear this, you'll know he wasn't, no doctor would pull this\nshit - he runs up to the guy, a kid, and lays him down. He asks for a knife, someone gives him\none - a large one at that, but no one asked any questions. Then he, and this is it, he actually slices the guy's throat open saying it's\na...\"traykeyonomy.\" He says this thing'll help him breathe! So - and no big fuckin' surprise\nhere - of course, the kid dies! I mean, geez! Even I know you don't slice someone's throat open.\nNeedless to say, I told everyone we should beat the crap outta this guy, and then I was grabbed and \"thrust forward in time\" some\nmore...\nSo a Dr. Maneszewski told me that that's how it is in the future. But in the future they find this animal who can cure it...then some nut-job thinks that they shouldn't mess with nature, that the disease came from nature, that nature will one day stop\nit - this, while people are dying everywhere and have been for a buncha' years.\nBut I'm gettin' ahead of this little story here.\nThe time machine guys, they wanna go back\n- just a little - and give the animal to someone and let them discover that this animal's piss will save the\nworld - and a lotta lives! So the nut-job...by the way, the nut-job is the young chick I mentioned b'fore, a med student. Sheila Bermudez-Kowalski (apparently you gotta be a Pollak in the future), an' she had pert titties. She travels across the country overnight, in one of those commercial 7-2000s they got now, and gets to California where she steals the animal and uses the time machine. And she goes back a couple hun'erd years, and she buries the animal.\nI know, so what? Get another animal! Well, I have some good news and bad news: the good news is: the rainforests're back! And they're huge I'm tellin' ya'! The bad news is, we ain't allowed in or even near 'em anymore...countries now shoot people who enter or disturb their rainforests...and you really don't wanna' hear what they do to you if you're a\nhunter - especially if you hunt whales! Even the Asians stopped huntin' whales because of the World Preservation fanaticals.\nWell, they can't get another animal because they hadda get special permission that one time to enter the rain forest to test and see if they could get a cure! And after only eight months, the schmucks scored\n- got real lucky - and found something. Oh, hey, this disease? It's only in the U.S. and no one's allowed in or out of the\ncountry - borders are sealed and, strangely, everyone thinks that's normal...something about a panic back when the last Vietnam Vet kicked the bucket! ('Parently some guy whose dad was a big-time general happened t' tell his son about all sortsa covert shit that the son, the Vet, then revealed on his own deathbed.) I mean, I think if any country deserves to be screwed this way it's ours. The people here're disrespectful of each other an' the government, and they still think the world owes 'em. White, black, red, or yellow, if you're born in the U.S. you're under a incorrect impression the world should bow before\nyou - screw that...everything's gotta be earned in life.\nIt's not like you can't go out, it's not like everyone is dying of it. It's like that AIDS, only they're unsure still how it's passed, and only about one out of every\n5,000 people have it.\nNow, ya' can't just travel back a thousand times. There's always something that'll change. Like, if you was the one which went back and built that big Stonehenge stuff. You took machinery back and placed a bunch of rocks on this place, because ya' knew someone was gonna', I dunno, put a goddamned ugly lawnjockey there or soemthin'. Well this \"monument\" would stop that from ever happening. Future is thus changed!\nLook, some chick just went back a few centuries and buried an animal. What'd it do? Well, at some point\n- somewhere - it made me twenty-five large richer. That's an effect of this whole time-traveling thing. It runs on hard-to-find chemicals of some sort, the time machine. Some rare \"ores\" or\nsomething - I didn't really listen, didn't care. The word \"ore\" sounds right. Doesn't really matter.\nOkay, but here's the deal, the whole story: this Sheila went back and buried the animal. I found it in my time. The fossil was put in a museum, I was given twenty-five thou for it. In the future, by the time she's returned, the fossil is seen in a showcase in a museum by some smart, sane guys. They trace where it came from and come find me in the past before I sell it...which is something I don't remember doing, but I saw it, so I remember seeing me do it...and we go back to my time and then go forward again (they said that's how it has to be done, I have to decide in the past to give it to these future people or the future where I sold it will still exist and when we appear in the their future, the fossil will be back in the museum even though I was holding it because if we just continued from the moment where I was given the check, then we're on that time-line even though it seems like we'd be on another one where I went with these white-coats on a time trip but it doesn't work that way and they don't know why. I ain't repeatin' that, so I hope you got it all.). So they show me how people're dyin' all over. Then they take me further into the future.\nI know, you're wondering what the heck I'm doing here. Some guy apparently told the scientists that I'd be of some help, because of my \"integral\" role in the past...someone told them it would be good karma. And, hey, who'm I t' argue with karma? If karma gets me to travel inta the future an' stuff, then karma's friggin' cool wit' me!\nNow, this Sheila gal, see, is in custody and won't talk they say. I'm only interested in what this machine can do. It's like somethin' out of Popular Science t' me. I try t' scare 'em and say, \"What if you crashed in my time, you'd be stuck there.\" But they just shrugged and one guy said, \"Never heard of automatic pilot?\" So that makes me wonder what airbags in the future're like, 'cause I was in an accident once\n- asshole hit me hard almost head on - and the airbag saved my life, but the piece of crap nearly suffocated me and didn't deflate right.\nI did learn that in the future the gas ain't polluting the air even a hundredth of what it was. Electric cars can go one-hunerd-seventy-five miles an hour and self-charge too! Cops finally give tickets to the asshole people goin' too damn slow on the highways. There're no sex diseases! You have no idea how cool that alone makes the world. There've been improvements in salene and silicon like you can't\nimagine - another cool thing! An \"ol'-fashioned\" giant t.v. costs two hun'erd dollars, cause there ain't a big demand for them anymore, now with the DVs being the big electronic store item. Oh, an there's a pill you can take that'll make you feel full once you've had an amount of liquor that \"relates to your body weight,\" so that way you don't have to worry about drinkin' too much. Works great. Los Angeles has a good sewer system and good public transportation and they know when an earthquake is comin' about two weeks in advance. And lastly, the boys at NASA regained respect when they, and I mean our boys alone, saved an alien space ship. The whole thing was televised.\nJust one guy up there actu'ly saw the aliens - and they do look like that guy you always saw on them tabloid covers, with the big eyes an' all\u2026y'know, from the astronaut\ndescribin' 'em\n- and we still haven't had any actual communication with the freaks...as a matter of fact, they was, um, reluctant to let the astronauts help (but no one thinks it's any kind o' coincidence that the secret t' time travel was discovered a few days after this). So this is all real cool. And then there's a disease that's\nkillin' people.\nSo maybe you're thinkin' this disease makes it sound all really bleak and all, but this is the great thing: the time machine travels through time, right? Well, it's also a mini airplane-type thing, so you can actually go anywhere you want. So, what they figure out, is that Sheila flew as far as Cincinnati before kicking that baby into timewarp mode. This means that she was flyin' while she was\ntime-traveling - not a rec'amendation unless you know where you're landin'. So me, mister simple guy without the white coat, tells them to send me back before she buried the animal. But they don't get me. They say, \"Hey, we don't know when she buried it.\" So I say, \"Well, then just send me way ,way back.\" And they say \"why,\" and I say, \"shut up,\" and they say \"well...,\" and I talk them into givin' me a shot and gettin' me some materials.\nSo it's like the 1800s or something, and there's nothin'\naround - but I'd seen some Indians and a wagon-coach thing. It takes me and these other guys about a month (one pussy had never camped out before, so he was\ndrivin' the rest of us bonkers), but we were able to build three big walls, each with, like, a, uh, cryptic symbol on it so that folks in the future will think they're these important monuments (Yep, one born every goddamned minute!)...Walls're about eight feet thick, so that if she arrives in a hun'erd years, they'll still be sturdy, ya' know? All facing different ways. Each one about fifty yards from the spot that Sheila'll one day bury the animal. So when they come back for me and these other guys who helped me put the walls up there, we're in the future again, an' I notice that the time machine is different, and they tell me it all worked...\nIn 1842 on August the 11th (which is the day, two hun'erd years later, that that Robin Williams guy dies), at four-thirty-six in the morning, Sheila flew the time machine right past a giant wall which was facing south-west...four seconds later, about fifty yards away, she hit a wall facing directly west. When it crashed, airbags\n- in the front, back and sides - all shot out, cushioning the inside of the ship. The nose of the time-travel machine was crushed at that moment of th' impact...this kicked-in the auto-pilot which sent the ship back to what they like to call \"present day\": 2058. It appeared in a barren field. Some goof passing by in a car at the time saw the thing appear and called the police on his phone...In an hour, the white coats and me were at the scene. Inside was\nSheila - out cold. Shaken up bad, but okay. In the back, in a cage, was this weird, small animal.\nIn 2052, on December the 25th, at noon, the phone rang at the home of a scientist. This scientist, by no coincidence\n- and this was done just to be \"ironic\" - was a Dr. Bermudez, dad to nice-titties-Sheila. Five days later a cure was found for a disease called the Tracheal\nGrippe - a term, the 'coats say, which doesn't quite, uh, fully describe the disease.\nSo, in 2066, on the spot where the \"Three Walls\" had sat for, around, two hun'erd twenty years, they demolished 'em and made way for this amazing\n- and I mean cool - and huge entertainment park where almost any dream can come true...with the help of \"extreme reality\" (The thing that followed the bullshit \"virtual\nreality\"). Since they was on private land, the walls weren't never really considered any sort of monument until people heard they were gonna' be torn down. The people who put up a stink, lost.\nI still live in the future...but, by the time this is read, it'll be the past and there'll probably still be books and movies and stories about bleak futures. They're all crap.\nEND\n|About Keith\nPlanit: A writer of finite wisdom, Keith was blessed with a\nsurname that makes him the perfect sci-fi writer...or real estate\nsalesman.

We would like to thank Sergeant Adib Julian for\nhis helpful suggestions and tips on preparing this appetizing dish. And\nthis is just one of the hundreds of useful recipes in Interplanetary\nFanny\u2019s New Book: \u201cIntergalactic Cooking for the Mom on the Go!\u201d (Elease\nMarch 3428 AD, JB5Clone Publishing Enterprises).\nFollow\nthese steps for a delightful meal!\nStep\nOne:\nSince\nthese are fiercely guarded by one or the other of the mated pair of\ndamn-beasts, this is, naturally, the hardest part. The second hardest\npart is finding a damn-beast den. The dens are commonly found in rocky\nupland areas, but are occasionally found in holes beneath mature\nfaux-teak trees. Whether they are beneath faux-teak or in rocky\noutcroppings, mature dens will only be found on or near hilltops that\nare out of reach of Marduk's notorious floods. The openings are\nrelatively small for such a large carnivore, but the damn-beast can\nflatten itself oblately - and so must the damn-beast hunter.\nPlacing\na group of guards outside the den, a single person, after removing his\nor her battle armor, can normally worm his or her way into the entrance.\nIt requires a person who is not overlarge or heavyset and fundamentally\nunafraid of confined spaces.\nRemember\nthat the damn-beast is heavily armored in the frontal quarters. Since\nthis is the only part our intrepid hunter is going to see, it is\nimperative that a high quality weapon be toted into the burrow. Although\none might prefer a plasma rifle, there are countervailing arguments (you\ncan't fit it in the burrow, it will kill and torch the kits you're\nplanning on eating, the blast will probably bring down the roof and even\nif it doesn't the back-blast in that confined space will surely kill\nyou). It is recommended that you use a bead pistol with armor piercing\nrounds. If such a weapon or ammunition is unavailable, the traditional\nMardukan weapon of choice is an assegai, a short spear. However, uhmmm,\nMardukans generally don't fit in the burrows so it's not so much\ntraditional as what they would\nuse - if they were stupid enough to try it and could fit in the burrow.\nBurrow\ntunnels are normally 20-30 meters in length, about a meter and a half\nwide and a half meter high. They will have two to three twists in them\nand at least one \"gooseneck\" to catch runoff from Marduk's\nnotorious rains. Note that the gooseneck will often contain standing\nwater, but the intrepid hunter should be able to duck through it and get\nto air on the other side.\nThese\nburrows exist because the damn-beast is a natural prey of the HOLY-SHIT!\nbeast. All items relating to preparation of Roast Suckling Damn-Beast\ncan be used for Roast Suckling HOLY-SHIT! beast. However, the hunter is\nreminded that the HOLY-SHIT! beast is seven times the size of the\ndamn-beast. Dress appropriately\nPassing\nthrough these obstacles our hunter should shortly thereafter encounter\nthe defending parent damn-beast. Remember, the damn-beast has no\nvulnerabilities on the front end. If using an automatic weapon, long,\nwildly uncontrolled bursts are the way to go. You won't have much time,\nso putting as many armor piercing rounds as possible on target is the\nonly way to be around to write your own article. Care and decorum are\nnot keynote words for the few seconds between \u201cWhat\u2019s\nthat smell?\u201d and \u201cOh, THANK GOD that\u2019s over!\u201d\nIf\nyou're using an assegai...drop me a note afterwards, will you? Not\nbefore, though. I'm required by Imperial Law to report suicide attempts.\nHaving\ndispatched the defending parent you will have to make your way past the\ncarcass. Since it will more or less block the opening to the den, I\nleave the method up to the discretion of the hunter. (In my case, let me\nsay two words: Big. Knife.).\nAfter\nthis you will have reached the horrible little bastards you are after.\nBy this time they will be feeding on their deceased parent, snapping at\nyou and generally making a real pain-in-the-ass of themselves. You can't\nkill the little bastards, (though if you ever try this, and succeed, you\nwill understand my lack of kindness towards these horrible little\nsnapping-turtle m*&^%$#@$%^&g bastards) because the cook wants\nthem \"as fresh as possible\". (The stupid m*&^%$#@%^&r.\nSee him trying this?)\nProceed\nto pick them up and put them in the sack you brought... Look, if you\njust brought these instructions with you and didn't read it in advance\nit's not my fault you didn't bring a sack! Proceed to...oh, I\nalready said that. And I suppose you forgot really thick, leather or\nsynth-armor gloves, right? Well, if you did, you're in trouble. These\nlittle c*&^%$#@%rs can BITE.\nOnce\nyou have them in the sack, you are more or less done. Well, except for\nturning around (I did mention this requires a small person,\nright? Right?) and crawling back through the, you know, the\ndebris. Dragging a sack. Full of screaming, clawing little m*&^%$#@cking\ndemons. But you're more or less done. With step one.\nStep\ntwo: Kill the little c*&^%$#@%rs.\nThe\ncook will probably want to do this him (or her) self until he (or she)\ntries it with one. And he (or she) will go on and on about not\ndisturbing them and proper bleeding, etc.\nGrab\nyour gloves. Take a big cleaver...\nStep\nThree:\nLet\nthe cook skin them. The scum gets all over your hands and stinks to high\nheaven. You already took a couple of showers and a bath to get momma off\nof you and you don't need to take a couple of more.\nStep\nFour:\nStuff\nwith barley rice and Mardukan taters. If the barley rice is seasoned\nwith jcsauce, it adds piquancy. (Piquancy here refers to the fact that\njcsauce is slightly hotter than pure capsicum.)\nStep\nFive:\nWrap\nin leaves (fire-tree leaves if available) and cover with a thick coating\nof wet clay.

The\nscreen rippled, then revealed the Queen of Spades. Damn. Five-zero for the\ncomputer! Again! She clenched her teeth and gripped the mouse so hard that\nher fingers hurt. She would win, she would, at least one game. Even if it\nwere to take the whole afternoon.\n\u201cAlice? Are you coming to tea?\u201d she heard her father\u2019s voice.\n\u201cTea?\u201d she repeated absent-mindedly. Her whole being was concentrating on\nthe game. It was impossible that a one-kilogram machine could outsmart her\nevery time. \u201cDad, do you think computers are intelligent? As in, can they\nreally think, the way you and I do?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Alice, of course not,\u201d her father appeared in the doorway. \u201cThey are\njust a mass of cables with electronic impulses, a string of \u2018on\u2019 and \u2018off\u2019\nsignals.\u201d\n\u201cBut they can do incredible things! They beat us in chess and in Hearts,\nthey schedule aeroplanes, they control product quality in large factories\n-\u201d\n\u201cTrue, in a matter of seconds they can perform arithmetic calculations\nthat we would take hours to complete. But we can catch a ball without much\ntrouble, while it takes years to explain to a computer how to play ball or\nrecognise a face.\u201d\n\u201cBut dad, look at this program. It\u2019s a psychiatric expert system. And it\u2019s\nfrightfully clever. You can\u2019t tell that it\u2019s a machine that\u2019s answering\nand not a human being!\u201d\nTwo heads bent towards the screen.\n\u201cSee, I load it and it asks, What\u2019s the problem? I type in, I don\u2019t know.\nIt replies, Try to tell me something about it -\u201d\n\u201cSay, No.\u201d\nAlice punched in \u2018N\u2019, \u2018O\u2019, then <enter>.\n\u201cCan you elaborate?\u201d flashed the screen.\nHer father shook his head. \u201cSay, I have lost interest in life.\u201d\nAlice punched the keys.\n\u201cNo good, dad. You can\u2019t beat it. It responds with, Tell me more about\nsuch feelings.\u201d\n\u201cWell, Alice, the computer seems to understand what you type in, of\ncourse, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s simply been programmed to recognise certain\nkey phrases and deliver a standard response. It certainly cannot think for\nitself.\u201d\n\u201cBut Dad, what does it actually mean - to think?\u201d Alice puckered her brow.\n\u201cWhat is a mind? Is it something that can exist only in an organic body?\nOr can it exist independently of a body, organic or not?\u201d\n\u201cAlice,\u201d her father shook his head. \u201cWherever do you get such ideas?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she shrugged impatiently. \u201cBut the computers we\u2019ve\nbuilt to date can already beat us at arithmetic. Wouldn\u2019t it be ironic if\nwe managed to create something that surpasses us in every respect?\nSomething that can feel and think better than we do?\u201d\nHer father grinned. \u201cImagine that. A creation that is superior to its\ncreator. You could almost call it blasphemy,\u201d he roared with laughter.\n\u201cNow why don\u2019t you leave the computer to its thinking processes, whatever\nthey may be, and pay attention to real life for a while, huh? Peter\u2019s\ncalled twice already. He wants to take you out for some hamburgers.\u201d\nAlice sighed. Real life, indeed.\n\u201cIn a moment, dad. Let me finish my game.\u201d\nHer father smiled. \u201cIn that case, I have something for you. Something\nbetter than a game.\u201d\nOh please, thought Alice, not another movie ticket. Not another book. Not\nanother mundane item that would tear her away from her computer and its\nmind.\n\u201cI meant to wait till your sixteenth birthday, but seeing that you\u2019re\nglued to the screen anyway -\u201d he halted and handed her a parcel. It was\nshaped like a hardcover best-seller. Damn, it was a book, after all. She\ntried to hide her disappointment. Better than a game of Hearts, my foot.\nThe label said, \u201cUNWRAP ME.\u201d Alice sighed and tore the paper. Inside was a\nplastic disc-holder. \u201cWelcome to the World of Virtual Reality,\u201d she read\nthe 3D letters.\n* * * * *\nAlice was flying through a forest. Below, she could see a gigantic\nmushroom. On its brown hat reclined a fat blue caterpillar. Oval rings of\nsmoke escaped through his mouth.\n\u201cAre computers intelligent?\u201d shouted Alice, flapping her wings.\nThe caterpillar looked up. \u201cYou\u2019d better ask the Hatter. He\u2019ll be serving\ntea presently. Perfect timing.\u201d\n\u201cBut I thought it was always teatime here.\u201d\n\u201cPrecisely,\u201d the caterpillar sucked on his pipe.\n\u201cBut the Hatter is as much a part of virtual reality as you are. Another\ncreation of some software development team. Why would he be able to answer\nme any better than you?\u201d\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s mad, that\u2019s why.\u201d Another blue ring drifted towards Alice,\ndispersing before it could reach her.\n\u201cSo are you,\u201d ventured Alice.\n\u201cYes, and so are you,\u201d replied the caterpillar. \u201cWe are all insane.\u201d\nAlice pursed her lips. \u201cYou certainly seem to reason like an intelligent\nbeing.\u201d\nThe caterpillar stared at a white rabbit that ran past the mushroom and\ndisappeared into the shrubbery. \u201cPerhaps I am an intelligent being, then.\u201d\nAlice flapped her wings again. \u201cAre you telling me that computers can\nthink? I mean, really think?\u201d\n\u201cWatch,\u201d the caterpillar blew out a large smoke bubble. In its hazy\nexpanse, Alice saw tangles of wires pulsating with life. Torrents of\nelectrons, like streamers at a carnival, flowed left and right.\nSuddenly the picture flickered and scattered into millions of tiny lights.\nAlice gritted her teeth and removed her goggles.\n\u201cPeter,\u201d she didn\u2019t bother hiding her irritation, \u201cI\u2019ve asked you a\nmillion times not to switch off my VR unit in the middle of a session. It\ngives me a headache. Besides, it\u2019s bad for the computer!\u201d\n\u201cAlice, we have to talk.\u201d There was concern on Peter\u2019s face.\n\u201cWe are talking.\u201d Alice fiddled with her virtual reality glove. It was big\nand heavy, uncomfortable for interfacing with the real world. But if she\nremoved it now, she would have to listen to Peter. And she knew what he\nhad to say. The same thing that he\u2019d been telling her since the day they\ngot married. The same thing he was saying now.\n\u201c... you live in Wonderland most of the time. You come out to eat and\nsleep. We never do anything together. Sometimes I wonder whether you know\nwhich world is real!\u201d\nAlice looked around the room. A leather sofa, Turkish carpets, a Venetian\nmirror. She shrugged. \u201cWho cares? What difference does it make which world\nis real? What\u2019s your definition of \u2018real\u2019 anyway?\u201d\n\u201cThere is only one reality, Alice.\u201d\n\u201cIs there? Only one? Well, Wonderland is my reality, then. The one and\nonly. Computer simulated or not, it\u2019s real to me.\u201d She paused. \u201cWhat do I\nhave to live for in your world anyway?\u201d\n\u201cMe,\u201d said Peter quietly. \u201cYou have me to live for.\u201d\nA familiar emotion stirred inside Alice. What was it, that feeling of your\nheart swelling up and wanting to jump out of your chest? That stinging in\nyour eyes, so different from the burning caused by too many hours behind\nvirtual reality goggles? She couldn\u2019t remember. She plucked at her glove,\nthen she fastened it again. With her left hand, she reached for the\nhelmet.\n* * * * *\nThe blue caterpillar had finished his pipe. \u201cYou\u2019re back,\u201d he observed.\n\u201cWhat were we talking about? Computers and intelligence?\u201d\nAlice descended onto the brown hat and sat next to the caterpillar. \u201cYou\nwere trying to tell me that computers can think.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d corrected the caterpillar. \u201cYou were trying to tell me that\ncomputers can think.\u201d\nAlice rolled her eyes skywards. \u201cWell, can they? I mean, you. Can you\nthink?\u201d\n\u201cI am therefore I think,\u201d replied the caterpillar.\n\u201cAh, but are you? Do you actually exist? Live and walk and talk?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d the caterpillar shrugged his foremost legs. \u201cWhat do you\nimagine I do here all day when you\u2019re out there in your world? Wait with a\nfrozen smile until you graciously decide to return?\u201d\n\u201cI - I\u2019m sorry,\u201d stammered Alice, \u201cIt\u2019s just that, you see, computer\nprograms are getting cleverer and cleverer. Parallel processing.\nRule-based expert systems that diagnose diseases better than any human\ndoctor. Case-based help-desk computer applications that know how to repair\ncars. Self-organising neural networks that imitate human thinking\nprocesses.\u201d\n\u201cMy point exactly,\u201d the caterpillar curled up in the afternoon sun. \u201cDo\nyou mind moving a trifle to the left? Thank you. So what\u2019s your problem?\u201d\n\u201cSo, don\u2019t you see that there is a difference between diagnosing cancer\nand inventing a cure for it? Between flawless data processing and genius\nintuition? Between simulating the operations of a fire brigade and feeling\nthe heat of the fire?\u201d\n\u201cSo who says that computers can\u2019t do both?\u201d sniggered the caterpillar. \u201cI\npostulate that given practically infinite resources, computers can\nsimulate human behaviour so well that it is indistinguishable from real\nhuman behaviour.\u201d The words were coming faster and faster. \u201cMoreover, I\npostulate that given enough data, history and the current hormone levels\nof an individual, for example, computers can predict reactions of that\nindividual to a specific situation. Whether a sentimental movie would make\nthat person cry, whether she feels like chocolate, what poetry she will\nwrite tomorrow.\u201d The caterpillar caught his breath. \u201cIn principle, that\nis,\u201d he added.\n\u201cPerhaps computers are able to simulate human behaviour, yes.\u201d Alice was\ngetting tired of the conversation. She found it hard to concentrate on the\ncaterpillar\u2019s words, to follow his reasoning. And they were diverging from\nthe topic. \u201cPerhaps they can do it so well that an observer can\u2019t tell the\ndifference between a human and a computer. But does all that mean that\nmachines can think like human beings?\u201d\n\u201cIs that the only thing that will convince you? If I prove to you that my\nthinking processes are identical to those of a human? Are you saying that\nhuman thinking is superior to other forms of thinking? That it is actually\nthe only acceptable form of thinking?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I guess not,\u201d conceded Alice. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to pass the Turing test\nand fool me into thinking that you\u2019re human. I simply want to know whether\nyou can think to the point of being self-aware!\u201d\nThe caterpillar turned indigo with rage. \u201cAre you saying that my whole\nlife is nothing but a few lines of code written by some computer nerd?\nThat I\u2019m only imagining that I exist? That virtual reality is not real?\u201d\nAlice extended her hand and stroked the rigid mandibles. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she\nwhispered, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt your feelings -\u201d She hesitated.\nFeelings? Did computer programs have feelings?\nThe caterpillar cleared his throat, his skin resumed a lighter shade of\nblue. \u201cHave you ever wondered,\u201d he curled up even tighter, \u201cwhether a\ncomputer can have a soul?\u201d\n\u201cA soul?\u201d At first, the concept seemed ludicrous. Alice wasn\u2019t even sure\nthat dogs had souls, for heavens\u2019 sake. Certainly not fish. And they were\nat least alive. \u201cAnd what happens to a computer\u2019s hypothetic soul if the\nnetwork goes down or the electricity is cut?\u201d she teased.\n\u201cAnd what happens to your soul when you are under anaesthetic?\u201d retorted\nthe caterpillar.\nWell, mused Alice, suppose that dogs who interact with humans,\nexperiencing human love and attention, somehow develop souls. Dogs and\ncats and horses. But computers? \u201cA computer could only have a soul if it\nwere self-aware,\u201d she concluded aloud. \u201cAnd if it were to interact with a\nhuman on a regular basis. And even then, I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m not sure at\nall.\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever wondered,\u201d the caterpillar continued as though she hadn\u2019t\nspoken, \u201cwhatever happens to electronic impulses once they\u2019re transmitted\nand gone? To the computer viruses that you exterminate with such vigour?\nTo outdated games that wait in vain in their boxes? To the bytes you\ndelete from your hard disk every day? Do they go to digital heaven? Or\ncyber hell, if they were bad bytes, full of errors and lost segments?\u201d\nA large shadow fell over the mushroom. The caterpillar shivered. Alice\nlooked up and gasped. It was Peter. The very enemy of Wonderland.\n\u201cAlice,\u201d he pleaded, \u201ccome home. You\u2019re wasting your life. Our life. Don\u2019t\nyou realise what you\u2019re doing to yourself? No fresh air, no exercise, no\nmental challenges.\u201d\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\u201cDarling, what\u2019s become of you? Why can\u2019t you see that this is an\naddiction? An illness? A curse? Alice, you\u2019re stuck in the Web like - like\nthe Lady of Shalott!\u201d\n\u201cLet me be. I\u2019m happy here.\u201d\nPeter chewed his lip. \u201cAlice, don\u2019t you ever have any doubts? Don\u2019t you\never wonder about the meaning of life? About the overall purpose of\nliving? Of having a family? Leaving your mark in the world?\u201d\n\u201cThe overall purpose to have a good time,\u201d Alice stretched out her wings,\nslowly, deliberately. \u201cAnd to discover amazing new things.\u201d\nPeter winced. \u201cIf only you had chosen a more inspiring setting, Alice.\nAncient Rome, the Amazon, the White House. You could be learning something\nthen. But - Wonderland?\u201d\n\u201cI am learning, silly. I\u2019m learning about computers. How they think.\nWhether they think the way we do. Peter, it\u2019s fascinating!\u201d\n\u201cListen, I can prove to you that computers cannot reason the way humans\ncan. I can stump your blue friend here with a simple diagonalisation\nargument.\u201d\nAlice turned to the caterpillar. \u201cHave you any idea what he\u2019s talking\nabout?\u201d\n\u201cLooks like diagonalisation arguments can stump some humans, too,\u201d\nchuckled the caterpillar. \u201cAnd yes, I do know what he\u2019s talking about. He\nthinks that computers, which are algorithmic by nature, cannot deduce from\na set of axioms that the set is incomplete.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Alice shrugged. \u201cThe point is, Peter, you\u2019re trying to change\nme. If you don\u2019t like me as I am, go find yourself somebody else. Go on, I\nwon\u2019t stop you. I\u2019ll even come out of Wonderland to sign the divorce\npapers.\u201d\nPeter clenched his fists. He opened his mouth, then closed it again. His\nimage burst into a myriad of electronic flames.\nThe caterpillar inserted a twig into the blaze and relit his pipe.\n\u201cMore and more humans come to live in virtual reality,\u201d he blew out an\nasymmetric smoke ring. \u201cHave you ever wondered what will become of your\nworld? Your generation is choosing virtual reality over the routine of\nwork, home and raising a family. What will happen to your unborn children?\nWhat if mankind dies out?\u201d\nAlice yawned. \u201cWho cares?\u201d\nThe caterpillar grinned. \u201cAnd you have the nerve to ask whether computers\ncan think?\u201d\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019re so smart, perhaps you can tell me what I must do. Go back\nto Peter? Or stay here and study computer intelligence?\u201d\n\u201cI guess it depends very much on what you want to achieve.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter to me.\u201d The sun felt so good and warm, thought\nAlice. If only the caterpillar would shut up.\nBut the caterpillar shot back, \u201cIn that case, it doesn\u2019t really matter\nwhat you choose to do, now does it?\u201d\nAlice was annoyed. \u201cAs long as I achieve something,\u201d she added to clarify\nthe point.\nThe caterpillar grinned even wider. \u201cI\u2019m sure you will, as long as you try\nlong and hard enough.\u201d He got up and started to disappear, from the tip of\nhis long body, to his wide grin. The grin remained suspended above the\nmushroom for a while longer.\n\u201cWait,\u201d shouted Alice. \u201cI still don\u2019t know -\u201d\nThe grin too faded away.\n* * * * *\nAlice looked around her room. Its only furniture was the virtual reality\nunit. She\u2019d sold everything else long ago, exchanged it for increasingly\nsophisticated hardware and software.\nThere were five terminals attached to the unit. From her station, Alice\ncould see the other four women, thin frames clad in heavy suits. When the\nfurniture money ran out, she\u2019d decided to sublet the apartment left to her\nin the divorce settlement. More and more people were turning to other\nrealities for comfort. She found sharing her VR-unit cumbersome at first,\nbut as time went by the hardware became fast enough to allow multiple\nusers without a compromise in speed.\nCold. Hungry. Alone. Always alone, despite the living cadavers sharing her\nspace. It had been - how long was it now since Peter\u2019d left - thirty,\nforty years? But who was counting? And who cared?

She\u2019d noticed\nhis dignified face earlier in the crowded room\nof strangers and his gaze had briefly met hers,\nthen strayed away, somehow disappointing her.\nShe was used to men looking at her. Since she\nwas seventeen boys had undressed her with their\neyes. But this man\u2019s glancing stare betrayed a\nkind of recognition that sent her heart pumping\nin her throat with a fearful thrill: could he be\none too?\n[SAM], she\u2019d sent her thought\nwave to her AI-partner. [Find out everything you\ncan on the person I\u2019m watching].\n[OKAY, MITCH], SAM had replied in\nher head.\nMitch had caught furtive glimpses\nof the stranger as he wandered among the other\nguests then lost sight of him. She\u2019d boldly\nsearched the room, unconsciously straightening\nher dress only to flinch when she found him\nstanding in front of her with an enigmatic\nsmile.\nYou\u2019re Mitch, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he\nsaid in a pleasant tenor\u2019s voice, his handsome\nlean face radiating a disquieting calm.\n\u201cMichelin,\u201d she corrected rather\ntartly, fighting down her rising defensiveness;\nno one called her Mitch except her best friend.\n\u201cYour boss pointed you out to me\nearlier,\u201d he explained, drawing her to a more\nsecluded corner of the room. \u201cFirst time to one\nof these, Michelin?\u201d He waved his hand to the\nroom.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, irked at herself\nfor blushing. Was it so obvious? Kraken had\ninsisted that she accompany him to this fancy\nouter-city party. She\u2019d come just to please her\nnew boss and worn the only good dress she owned.\nJorge tipped his head sideways\nand a network of lines radiated from his sudden\nblue eyes. \u201cKraken calls you a genius, but I\nknow you\u2019re just a veemeld.\u201d\nHer heart slammed and she\nbristled, eyes involuntarily darting around to\nmake sure no one overheard his accusation. Now\nshe knew why she\u2019d been repelled and attracted\nto him at the same time. She\u2019d guessed right\nearlier: he was a veemeld too. A rude one.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said softly,\noffering a conciliatory smile. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to\ninsult you. I\u2019m also a veemeld. You hide it\nwell. I didn\u2019t sense you.\u201d\nAnd why should he? she thought\npeevishly. She\u2019d taught SAM, her AI-partner, to\nkeep her isolated from the AI-core, effectively\nblocking her thoughts from other veemelds. And\nJorge was polite, not intrusive like that\nscruffy vagrant boy, Dexter, she\u2019d run into\nearlier today near her shack in the inner-city.\nThe little creep had followed her home again and\nwhen she\u2019d turned to glare at him his thoughts\nburst into hers like the groping hands of an\ninexperienced lover. He\u2019d plowed right into her\nmind, blundered into the front door of her brain\nwith the excitement of sensing another veemeld\u2019s\nenergy field. Jorge had only flirted in a back\nalley of her mind, gently probing via their\nrespective AI-partners. He\u2019d guessed the rest.\n\"Your avatar is?...\u201d Jorge\ntrailed, obviously hoping she\u2019d provide the\nanswer.\nMitch gave him a crooked smile\nand obliged, \u201cSAM. My AI-entity\u2019s called SAM.\u201d\nJorge\u2019s eyes sparkled. \u201cAh.\u201d He\nlooked impressed. \u201cShort for Samantha?\u201d\n\u201cSmart Analog Machine.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d He nodded. \u201cSAM has quite a\nreputation in the core. I should have known it\nwas \u2018you\u2019.\u201d\nThere followed a moment of\nsilence, which neither offered to break. Jorge\nlost his smile, his mind elsewhere, as Mitch\nbrushed chestnut hair from her face. Then Jorge\nleaned closer, his eyes penetrating, and\nconfided, \u201cIt\u2019s lonely being a veemeld, isn\u2019t\nit?\u201d\nHer face flared. Unable to meet\nhis probing eyes, Michelin dropped her gaze. She\nfound herself staring down her cleavage past her\nblack silk dress to her long bare legs and\nthinking that her dress was too tight and too\nshort. Was he coming on to her?\n\u201cThey treat us more like tools\nthan people,\u201d Jorge went on in her silence.\nMichelin looked up into his sad eyes. \u201cWhen I\nannounced that I was a veemeld in school, the\nother students harassed me. My bosses use me\nlike a commodity to be traded or disposed of.\u201d\nHe exhaled slowly and ran his long fingers\nthrough his gray hair. \u201cWhen researchers\ndeveloped the AI-core and the technology to use\nit, they had no idea that only point five\npercent of the population could veemeld with\nit.\u201d\n\u201cActually, it\u2019s 0.2%\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d He smiled wryly. \u201cBut it is\nrather sad, isn\u2019t it, how it all turned out,\u201d he\ncontinued with a thoughtful expression.\n\u201cScientists have now proven that just through\nthe act of veemelding, we improve our cognition,\nmemory and learning, particularly our ability to\nrespond to changing environmental information.\nWe do it through activation --\u201d\n\u201cOf theta rhythm in the\nhippocampus. Yes, I know. We use the\nhigh-frequency tetanic pulses generated by the\nAI-core to activate a particular phase of theta\nrhythm during veemeld.\u201d\nJorge nodded enthusiastically.\n\u201cEvery part of the brain that\u2019s enhanced in\nveemelds is involved in theta rhythm: the brain\nstem that transmits signals to the septum, which\nthen activates TR in the hippocampus and the\nentorhinal cortex. While normal people rely on\nREM sleep to activate theta rhythm, veemelds\nhave it on all the time. Remarkable, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nHe slipped his elegant hands into his pockets.\n\u201cYour whole body is a symphony of rhythms, a\nvehicle of spontaneous, persistent synchrony.\nFireflies talk with light; planets speak through\nthe force of gravity; heart cells share electric\ncurrents. We...\u201d His eyes fired with emotion.\n\u201cImagine what humanity could be if we all\nconnected like a single autopoietic system in a\nkind of synchronal dance.\u201d\nMitch shrugged. She didn\u2019t\nusually have time for dreamers - and Jorge was\nobviously a dreamer. She indulged him anyway: \u201cautopoietic?\u201d\nJorge smiled like he\u2019d won a\nprize: her attentive ear, she supposed. \u201cI\u2019m\ntalking about the whole of our society behaving\nand evolving in a self-organized, adaptive way.\nWe already do this - veemelds, that is. Have\nbeen long before the AI-technology came along.\u201d\nShe gave him a skeptical\nhalf-smile. \u201cPeople \u2018veemelding\u2019 without the\nAI-core?\u201d\n\u201cProof is all around us,\nMichelin, in the independent formulation of\ncalculus by Newton and Leibniz or the theory of\nthe evolution of species by Charles Darwin and\nAlfred Russel Wallace. Then there\u2019s McFadden and\nPocket independently but simultaneously\ntheorizing that electromagnetic fields are the\nseat of our consciousness. Multiple independent\ndiscoveries have increased in society a\nthousand-fold since the nineteenth century. Did\nyou know that? The reason is obvious: the fabric\nof our society is evolving into a neural\nnetwork, learning, interacting and sharing\ntoward the achievement of a common zeitgeist.\u201d\nMitch folded her arms across her\nchest. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t prove the existence of\nveemelds.\u201d\nJorge\u2019s eyes lit to her\nchallenge. \u201cWell, there are two schools of\nthought on multiple independent discoveries:\nthat it\u2019s a function of either social context or\nthe qualities of the individuals making the\ndiscovery such as inventive genius. I think it\u2019s\nboth. I think most of our geniuses were\nfrustrated veemelds waiting for a better vehicle\nto tap into - the quantum electromagnetic waves\nof the AI-core - but they made due with\nhumanity\u2019s subtle autopoietic system instead.\u201d\nMitch caught herself smirking.\nJorge hadn\u2019t struck her as arrogant; yet he was\nsuggesting that every genius from Newton to\nEinstein was a veemeld! But she couldn\u2019t help\nthinking his premise elegant. Scientists had\nfigured out that the unique genetic makeup of\nveemelds provided them with, among other things,\na slightly different electromagnetic field\narrangement, one better suited to sending and\nreceiving non-local fields outside their bodies.\nWhich explained why veemelds, alone, could...\nwell, veemeld.\nAs though he were reading her\nthoughts, Jorge went on. \u201cWhen McFadden and\nPocket simultaneously but independently proposed\nthe theory of a localized electromagnetic field\nas the seat of consciousness a hundred years\nago, they had no idea what Pandora\u2019s Box they\u2019d\nopened. We now know that there are so many\ndifferent kinds of energy fields with differing\nfrequency and waveform surrounding our brains\nand our entire bodies and connecting us to the\nrest of the planet and universe, like --\u201d\n\u201cStatic and pulsed EM,\nquantum-vacuum fields, gravitational fields and\ncosmic and particle-mediated fields to name a\nfew,\u201d Mitch leapt in, not to be outdone. She was\nKraken\u2019s \u201cgenius\u201d after all.\nJorgen nodded with a thoughtful\nsmile. \u201cI thought that perhaps all humans -\nveemelds and non-veemelds - could eventually\ncommunicate as we are meant to - as a single\nautopoietic system, through the subtle force\nfields that embrace all life and non-living\nentities of our planet and universe. Imagine a\nworld where there\u2019s no war because we all\ncommunicate and understand one another.\u201d\nHow na\u010fve he was! \u201cYou\u2019re\nsuggesting that geniuses - veemelds --\u201d She\nfought down a sneer. \u201c-- are simply more in tune\nwith cosmic forces so they can tap into?...\u201d she\ntrailed with a shrug.\n\u201c-- The web of our greater\nconsciousness,\u201d he finished for her, quite\nserious. \u201cThe autopoietic network of our\nhumanity... waves of consciousness.\u201d\n\u201cWaves of consciousness,\u201d she\nrepeated, finding it hard to hide the jeering\ntone that crept into her voice. \u201cA new kind of\nenergy field? Surfing the consciousness\nwave?...\u201d She felt a sarcastic smile tugging at\nher lips.\n\u201cFar-fetched, you think?\u201d His\neyes gripped hers. \u201cIt\u2019s not so different from\nwhat we already know is true. EM-mediated\nconsciousness, for instance, and non-localized\nwave propagation. Researchers have long known\nabout the phenomenon of \u2018collective effect,\u2019\nMichelin. The synchronicity of multicellular\norganisms and societies of insects are good\nexamples of \u2018collective consciousness\u2019, and\n\u2018social facilitation.\u2019 Either way, we\u2019re the\nkey. Veemelds. We\u2019re the nodes of the human\nnetwork. I\u2019m convinced that all humans are\ncapable of it. They just need to be taught. By\nus.\u201d He smiled wistfully. Then he exhaled and\nthe fire in his eyes died. \u201cJust a dream, I\nsuppose.\u201d Jorge stroked his jaw pensively. \u201cIf\nanything we\u2019re growing more isolated and\ndistrustful.\u201d\nHis words resonated in her gut\nand she dropped her gaze to the floor again. It\nwas a wonderful dream nevertheless.\nJorge pursed his lips, letting\nhis gaze stray for a moment to a distant place.\nWhen he refocused on her, his eyes glinted and\nhis voice took on an edge. \u201cThey fear us,\nMichelin, what we can do: talk to machines in\nour heads. Run the city. The luddites have\nturned that fear to hatred. They\u2019re terrified by\nour unique connection with the AI-community.\nWe\u2019re dangerous freaks to them. Genetic\nmonsters. Cyborgs...\u201d\nMachine-sluts...\n\u201cWe have no mark to show what we\nare,\u201d Jorge went on, \u201cso we can choose to hide\nin our anonymity. The luddites would like to\nchange that. Brand us with some visible mark.\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons I formed the Veemeld\nAlliance. Do you know about us?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said guardedly.\n\u201cBut you haven\u2019t joined us.\u201d\nJorge looked puzzled. He pulled out a durable\ncard and pressed it warmly in her hand. \u201cWe\u2019re\nhaving a meeting tonight, in fact. At my place.\u201d\nThen his eyes glowed like a warm camp fire. \u201cI\u2019d\nlike to be a friend.\u201d His sincere expression\ndrew her in. \u201cA real friend.\u201d\nLonging swelled up her throat and\nmade her swallow convulsively. She knew what he\nmeant: a friend who knew what she was.\nHe tilted his head and gazed at\nher with intense curiosity. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any\nfriends, Michelin. Yet you\u2019ve lived here for a\nyear, the longest time you\u2019ve stayed in one\nplace.\u201d\nMitch jerked her hand out of his\nand clenched her jaw. That wasn\u2019t true, she\nfumed. She had Nancy, after all. Her best\nfriend... She thought again... Nancy didn\u2019t know\nshe was a veemeld. If Nancy did, would she still\nbe Mitch\u2019s friend? Mitch had long ago learned to\nmove rather than face the consequences of\nintimacy. Her gaze darted around the room,\nlooking for Kraken.\nJorge continued in a soft voice.\n\u201cVeemelds can be fiercely independent and\nsecretive. Whenever we conceal something of\nourselves we choose to become slaves to our\nsecret.\u201d\nShe knew he meant her.\n\u201cIt\u2019s only together in open\nsolidarity that we can overcome the prejudice -\nthe fear and hatred - against us. Perhaps we can\nteach them that they don\u2019t need to fear us.\u201d His\neyes grew intense and she fought the urge to\nback away. \u201cMichelin, we need you.\u201d He drew\ncloser to her and she recoiled. \u201cOur community\nneeds you. You\u2019re intelligent and... very\nattractive. You\u2019d make an excellent spokesperson\nfor us. With your help we could take charge of\nour destiny and move the human race forward to\nembrace a harmony of diversity. Everyone needs a\nfriend, Michelin. Including you.\u201d\nMitch felt anger heat her face.\nShe didn\u2019t need his solidarity or his\nfriendship. She\u2019d done just fine on her own up\nto now. She gave Jorge back his card. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\nbut I\u2019m not interested in joining your alliance.\nI\u2019m happy just being an Icarian.\u201d\nHe blinked several times then\nstuttered, his voice rising a pitch, \u201cBut, how\ncan you say that? You can never be just an\nIcarian --\u201d\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m a... genius?\u201d she\nscoffed and brushed past him. \u201cGood day.\u201d\nShe glimpsed his crestfallen face\nas she walked briskly to the other side of the\nroom where Kraken stood, talking to another man.\nKraken leered down at her and enveloped her in\nhis arm like a possession. She felt a hollow in\nthe pit of her stomach.\nMitch excused herself early from\nthe party and took the tube-jet home. She\nwatched the amber emergency lights strobe past\nher as the tube-jet dove into the darkness of\nthe tunnel. She saw Jorge\u2019s kind face in her\nmind and found herself thinking about that\nmiserable day when the girls at school\ndiscovered what she was...\n* * * * *\nEager to make a good impression\non her new school friend, Mitch was helping\nAbbie who struggled with her Ecology 101 lesson.\nThey shared a holo-module at the Ed-Center and\nAbbie turned from the holo-com to Mitch, seated\nbeside her. \u201cHere\u2019s my answer to his question on\nthe principals of Icarian ecology,\u201d she\nconfided. \u201c\u2018Ecosystems develop through natural\nselection from generally chaotic, pioneer stages\ntoward stable ordered stages which maintain a\ndynamic equilibrium through internal forces\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Abbie, that thinking\u2019s a\nhundred years out of date. Ecosystems function\nand change under stable chaos, naturally cycling\nthrough destructive and building phases through\nchanging variables --\u201d\n\u201cNonsense!\u201d a gruff voice\nscolded. Michelin flinched and looked up at the\nteacher who towered over her. She fought from\ncowering under his glare. \u201cYou\u2019re quoting\nheretical theories, young woman!\u201d\nShe looked into his nostrils and\nfocused on the dark hairs inside as she said in\na shaky voice, \u201cBut I read --\u201d\n\u201cRead!\u201d he cut her off. Several\nother students peered round their cubicles.\n\u201cMore like cheated by slutting with your AI\nfriends for information.\u201d The teacher leaned\nover her and his small eyes narrowed. \u201cI won\u2019t\nhave you disrupting my class. We don\u2019t cater to\nveemeld brats.\u201d He sneered to her look of\nhorror. He\u2019d just given her away. \u201cYes, I know\nwhat you are,\u201d he ended menacingly. He stalked\naway as gawking faces ducked behind the\ncubicles.\nDuring break Mitch was looking\nfor Abbie in the school mall when a classmate\ncollided into her. \u201cOut of my way, veemeld!\u201d The\ngirl snarled.\nMitch backed away. \u201cI\u2019m not a\nveemeld,\u201d she lied.\n\u201cYes you are.\u201d The girl sneered.\n\u201cI heard the teacher.\u201d Several other girls\nclosed in on her, forming a ring.\n\u201cVeemeld! Veemeld!\u201d they chanted,\nshoving her until she fell to the ground.\n\u201cAI-slut --\u201d\nMitch scrambled up in angry\ndefense. \u201cI\u2019m not a vee --\"\nA fist struck her on the mouth,\nsplitting her lip. \u201cVeemeld slut!\u201d\nHer lip pounded and she tasted\nblood. The girls pressed against her, their\nfaces distorted with hatred. They pummeled her\nas the chant resumed. \u201cVeemeld! Veemeld!\u201d Voices\nbuilt, echoing like a mantra, to the increasing\nrhythm of their blows. Mitch tucked her head\ndown and raised both arms to protect her face\nand chest, taking the blows with her shoulders\nand back.\n\u201cHey!\u201d A teacher approached. The\ngirls scattered like flies disturbed from a\ncarcass. Mitch fled in the opposite direction,\nglancing back. \u201cYes, you! Stop!\u201d the teacher\nshouted at her. She rushed into the closest\nbathroom and, finding an empty cubicle, slid in\nand slammed the door shut. She slumped on the\ntoilet, elbows on her knees, and cradled her\nhead in her hands, rocking and sobbing, and\nhearing the hum of those cursed AI machines in\nher head. She was getting tired of moving...\n* * * * *\nMitch was the only one who got\nout at the inner-city station. She inhaled the\nfamiliar stink of urine, stale liquor and\nrotting garbage as she picked her way past shiny\npools of spit and pies of dried vomit to the\nstairway that led outside. Mitch bolted the\nstairs two by two to the exit and flung open the\ndoor. She took in a deep inhale of fresh air and\nshivered in the bracing cool air. Wrapping her\nbare arms around her waist for warmth, she\nheaded home at a brisk pace and watched the long\njerking shadow of herself that the pale moon\nthrew ahead of her. She found herself stealing\nglances at the dozens of bivouacs that littered\nthe street: eclectic shacks, built out of scrap\nfrom discarded droids, abandoned furniture, even\nparts of an old tube-jet, and cemented with the\ndetritus of urban fast-living. Her shack wasn\u2019t\nmuch better but it was home... for now. This was\nthe roughest part of town. Hell, she\u2019d lived in\nworse places. One just had to be smart and\ncareful --\nShe\u2019d just turned a corner to the\nshortcut she normally took when her stomach\nclenched at the sound of grunts, shouting and\nmalicious laughter that drifted up the dark\nalley. Heart pulsing up her throat, Mitch stole\nforward. When she emerged from the alley into a\ncourtyard, she saw five teenage boys beating a\nyounger boy -- Oh, no... unmistakable, the\nchaotic hair and the rags he wore: it was\nDexter, the young veemeld who kept following her\nhome.\nHe must have caught her emotional\nsurge because his head jerked round and he\nlooked right at her even though she was still\nhidden in the shadows of the alley. [Please!\nHelp me!] came his outburst.\nMitch threw her gaze around in\nsearch of another bystander. No luck. The place\nwas empty save the boy\u2019s attackers and her.\nMitch gripped her lower lip in her teeth,\nfeeling a surge of adrenalin. Dexter was too\nyoung and feral to command respect from the\nAI-community, but she was another matter. She\nsquared her shoulders then stepped out into the\nlight and shouted in a commanding voice \u201cStop\nthat now!\u201d\nThe boys halted and stared at\nher. She caught several lecherous grins and\npulled down on her short dress. Dexter whimpered\non the ground and the leader, a square-faced boy\nwith spiked hair pointed down at him. \u201cHe\u2019s a\nfreaking veemeld!\u201d he said as though it fully\nexplained their actions. \u201cStay out of it, lady.\u201d\n\u201cI meant it,\u201d she said and\nmarched toward them, hands balled at her sides.\n\u201cStop right now! You\u2019re hurting him!\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d The leader\nspat out. It suddenly dawned on him: \u201cYou\u2019re one\ntoo, aren\u2019t you? A fucking freak.\u201d\n\u201cNo way, Russ,\u201d one of the other\nboys interjected, licking his lips. \u201cShe\u2019s too\nluscious to be a veemeld.\u201d Several of the other\nboys agreed.\nShe could slink out of there,\nMitch thought. Like all the times before, they\ndidn\u2019t want to believe she was a veemeld; she\ncould take advantage of her beauty and retreat\nback into the shadows. They probably wouldn\u2019t\nkill Dexter. She could let him fend for himself,\nlike she\u2019d fended for herself all these years...\nThen her eyes flickered over\nDexter\u2019s cowering form, head tucked in and both\narms raised to protect his face and chest. She\nfired back \u201cYes!\u201d She practically gasped the\nword and felt the terrifying exhilaration of\nunburdening herself. \u201cI am.\u201d The words surged up\nher throat like an electric charge, burning all\nthe way up: \u201cI\u2019m a veemeld too!\u201d\nA few boys moaned in\ndisappointment, scanning her covetously. \u201cWhat a\nwaste of good babe meat,\u201d one of them sighed.\nThe leader sneered as she resumed\nher advance. \u201cOnce we\u2019re finished here, you\u2019ll\nhave your turn,\u201d he said. The other boys\nfollowed with enthusiastic noises. \u201cGrab the\nAI-slut!\u201d he commanded, pointing to her. Two\nboys dashed for her with churlish grins.\nMitch fought from recoiling but\nhalted. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you won\u2019t be doing that\neither,\u201d she said. The two boys sniggered.\nMitch clenched her teeth but\nstood her ground.\n[SAM], she sent her thought wave\nto her AI-companion. [Instruct the security\nsystem of Liv-Building E-29 to dispose of the\nfive boys causing crimes, beta 050 and 051.\nVisual through my retina].\n[OKAY, MITCH], SAM responded\ninside her head. Instantly, several ports on the\nbuilding swiveled and discharged a concussion\nlaser beam at the five boys, instantly stunning\nthem. They crumpled to the ground in unison like\na strangely choreographed macabre ballet. The\ntwo who\u2019d rushed her tumbled a meter from her.\nMitch side-stepped them and rushed to Dexter,\nwho lay curled up in a fetal position, entwined\nwith limp arms and legs. As she bent over him,\nMitch continued her thought to SAM: [instruct\nsecurity droids of Region E to collect these\nfive hoodlums and put them into the cooler. They\ncan use my visual for the crime record].\n[OKAY, MITCH. THEY\u2019RE ON THEIR\nWAY].\n[Thanks, SAM]. Mitch touched\nDexter and he flinched. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said in\na gentle voice. \u201cYou\u2019re safe now.\u201d\nHe looked up, wide-eyed through a\nbloody and dirt-smeared face. Suddenly realizing\nwhat had happened, Dexter cracked a big grin,\nrevealing a bloody mouth, which didn\u2019t seem to\nconcern him anymore. \u201cYou did it, didn\u2019t you?\nYou got the AIs to blast \u2018em, didn\u2019t you? I knew\nyou were a veemeld. That was awesome\u2026\u201d\nShe realized that she didn\u2019t need\nto answer his steady stream of questions and\nexclamations. \u201cCome on.\u201d She helped him to his\nfeet. \u201cCan you get up? I\u2019ll take you to my place\nand clean you up. Looks like you\u2019ve got a few\nnasty cuts.\u201d\nThey left the courtyard for her\nshack as the city\u2019s security droids arrived.\nWhen they entered her place, Mitch pulled out\nher first aid kit, sat Dexter down by the sink\nin the bathroom and gently washed his mouth\nbefore applying some antiseptic healing gel.\n\u201cLooks like they were trying to\nshut you up,\u201d she observed with a wry smile,\nthinking of how he\u2019d poked his mind where he had\nno business being.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Dexter said. \u201cI keep\ntelling everyone I\u2019m a veemeld.\u201d\nMitch snorted. \u201cWhy on Earth\nwould you do that?\u201d She snapped the first aid\nkit shut and leaned against the sink to give him\na long hard look. \u201cYou don\u2019t look dumb. So, why\ndo you tell everyone? You\u2019re just looking for\ntrouble, Dexter.\u201d\n\u201cNo. Just a real friend. Someone\nwho\u2019ll like me for what I am.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re willing to get beat\nup time and time again to find that person?\u201d\nHe nodded and gave her a goofy\nsmile despite his puffy split lip. \u201cI found\nyou.\u201d\nMitch felt a strange mixture of\nemotions swell into her throat. \u201cCome on,\u201d she\nfinally said. \u201cI know someone who wants to meet\nyou, then. A whole community.\u201d\n* * * * *\nWhen Jorge opened the door he\ngasped. \u201cWhat a surprise!\u201d He beamed with\nundisguised pleasure, glancing from Mitch to\nDexter. \u201cCome in, come in!\u201d He swung the door\nopen for them to enter. A dozen or so people\npursuing desultory conversation were already\nseated in comfortable chairs in Jorge\u2019s living\nroom. The meeting must have started already,\nMitch observed.\nShe waved her hand at the boy.\n\u201cThis is Dexter. He\u2019s a veemeld too. Like us,\u201d\nshe ended with a half-smile. \u201cI told him he\u2019d\nfind a few genuine friends here.\u201d\nJorge nodded with enthusiastic\napproval. \u201cI\u2019m sure he will. Hello, Dexter.\u201d\nJorge was about to introduce both\nof them to the other veemelds in the room, when\nMitch touched his arm. \u201cAnd,\u201d she added in a\nlowered voice, \u201cI\u2019ve reconsidered what you\nasked. I\u2019d like to try being a spokesperson for\nveemelds...\u201d\nShe noticed that the room was\nsuddenly quiet and everyone was looking at her.\n\u201cThank you, Michelin,\u201d Jorge\nsaid, taking her hand and pressing it between\nhis two.\nShe pressed back. \u201cYou can all me\nMitch,\u201d she said, her smile opening to a broad\ngrin.\nNina Munteanu is an internationally published\nauthor whose fiction and non-\nfiction has appeared in publications throughout\nthe US, Canada, the UK, and Romania since the 1980s.\nHer short story \u201cAngel\u2019s Promises\u201d was nominated for\nthe Speculative Literature Foundation (SLF) Fountain\nAward in 2004.

Scott Russell\n\"Hang\non, it's gonna roll!\"\nThe\nreaver wagon took the full impact of the avalanche against its flank and\ntilted up on three of its six wheels. Thunder shook the cold cabin and a\ncloud of snow and ice particles blotted out the wan sun. Artur fought\nwith the controls and for a moment it seemed as if the old wagon were\nsending every outrage its operators had ever forced it to endure back up\nthe control yolk. In the seat next to Artur, Ebb Reilly clung to the\narmrests of his battered nav chair. Somewhere from the haze that served\nas memory a prayer was summoned.\n\"Big\nslide! Big one!\" Artur yelled. Not panicked, Artur was too dumb to\npanic, Ebb reasoned. No, Artur was excited. Typical. The whole damn\nmountain was dropping on them and Artur thought it was another\nadventure. Ebb gripped his chair so hard he thought his knuckles might\nburst in the freezing air.\nThrough\nthe dim light Ebb saw a large ham-fisted shadow reach out and grab the\nthrottle control. A steady drone became a frantic whine and Artur said\nin a calm and calming bass, \"Gonna paddle our way out.\"\nEbb\nfelt a sickening lurch as the wagon collided with something more solid\nthan rampaging snow. The world seemed to jerk ninety degrees and his\neyes saw a thin gash of light form beyond the windscreen. Through this\nnarrow window he saw that they were being pulled quickly and inexorably\nthrough a plummeting fog of gauzy snow.\nBeyond lay a steep rocky drop and the strange sun-lit calm of a\ndistant valley. Ebb saw all this in the flash of a millisecond and\nrealized he was an unwilling passenger on Nature's Worst Roller-Coaster.\nArtur\nobviously saw the same thing and summoned something between a war-whoop\nand a rebel yell. Ebb squeezed his eyes shut. The thought of the roller\ncoasters of long-lost Earth produced the incongruous sensation of cotton\ncandy melting in his mouth. Millimeters beyond the cabin's thin ceramic\nshell the planet men had called Merlin roared its cold displeasure.\nEbb\nwasn\u2019t sure exactly when he knew that It was all over. The bellowing\nin his ears, some combination of avalanche and Artur, eventually ended.\nLong moments passed in which he was suspended in pensive silence. Then a\nclanging noise startled him and he opened his eyes. Artur undogged the\noverhead hatch. Ebb cried out. The windscreen showed only midnight. They\ncould be under a hundred meters of snow and ice. Trapped until the air\nran out. Artur struggled with the hatch, twisted his shoulder against\nthe composite frame, and braced his thick boots on the stained engine\ncover that sat between the driver and nav positions. The big man\u2019s\nmass squeezed Ebb closer to the passenger\u2019s hatch. Artur pushed and\ngrunted. Ebb was about to tell his companion to give it up when Artur\ngave one final chuff and shoved the hatch open.\nPowdery\nsnow and blinding light fell into the cabin. It was quickly followed by\nthe bite of Merlin\u2019s bitter air. Minus twenty centigrade was a balmy\nday here in the tropics. Ebb winced and switched his helm to minimal\nflux. He plucked his gloves from the vest of his thermsuit and sealed\nthem over his hands. Artur twisted and pulled himself onto the wagon\u2019s\nroof. Then there came a whoop and a muffled thud.\n\"I\nhope you don\u2019t expect me to dig you out!\u201d Ebb yelled and then cursed\nhimself for a fool. Just their luck if he started another slide.\nEbb\nstruggled out onto the wagon\u2019s roof. The big vehicle had come to rest\nbetween the walls of a ravine. Wedged tight. The monocular in his helm\nshowed Ebb the rest. Above and several kilometers behind lay the steep\nmountain pass they had attempted to cross. The avalanche had pushed them\nover a flat that under better circumstances would have been an alpine\nmeadow. Then snow and debris and wagon had all dropped down a steep\nfield of scree. That field now lay buried under uncountable tonnes of\nsnow and ice. The heavy snow had settled in flow shaped layers from the\ntop of the pass down into this canyon. The wagon had ridden near the\ncrest of the avalanche. Somehow, it had surfed its way through the\nflow\u2019s terminal velocity zone and eventually settled here as the slide\nlost momentum. If they had been hit anywhere else along the pass they\nwould have been entombed in the snow. Ebb felt a growing chill and\nsealed the neck of his thermsuit.\n\u201cLook\u2019s\nfine, look\u2019s fine.\u201d\nEbb\nglanced down. Artur waded through waist deep powder as he checked the\ncondition of the wagon. The wagon was twenty meters in length and five\nmeters wide and it took the big man several minutes to make the circuit.\nEbb walked along the roof and checked com gear and sensor arrays. They\nhad lost their spider dish for microsat links and one of the many whip\nantennae. Overall though, the hardware had made it through the fall.\nWhen Artur climbed back up he reported much the same. And one other\nitem.\n\u201cTube\ntrees.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nEbb turned in the direction the big man had pointed.\n\u201cTube\ntrees, see.\u201d Artur said. And then with a grunt he was off the roof and\nback down in the snow. He quickly headed over the top of the ravine and\ntoward the canyon beyond.\n\u201cHey,\nwait! Wait!\u201d Ebb called. But Artur pressed ahead as if he hadn\u2019t\nheard him and Ebb, despite his better judgment, decided to follow.\nAt\nfirst Ebb struggled to make his own path through the fluff but then\nopted to follow in Artur\u2019s wake. It made the going easier and Ebb\ncould concentrate on his luck at being partnered with yet another\ngenius. Of course, if you read the Project bios they were all geniuses.\nTwo hundred settlers sent out from Earth to set up a new home on Alpha\nCentauri II. But Merlin\u2019s spell was a dangerous one and the trip to\nthe odd little world in its strange retrograde orbit around the Sun-like\nstar was not without hazards. The crossing took a full fifty years at\nzero point one c. Mighty Lancelot\u2019s engines worked perfectly\nbut its hibernaculum less so. A full tenth of their complement did not\nsurvive the passage. The rest suffered varying degrees of hibernation\nloss. Artur had been one of the ship\u2019s designers. Now he was little\nmore than an excitable six year old boy with a love of new places and\nthe tales of, appropriately enough, King Arthur.\nEbb\ncouldn\u2019t remember what exactly he had been. Logistician. Whatever the\nhell that was. It made him angry to try to remember what he had once\nbeen. In fact, lots of things made him angry these days. Ebb frowned\ninto the cold air. Thinking was for the smartie AIs back at Warrick, a\nthousand kilometers from here. They told them what to do and how to do\nit. Like take a reaver and drive way the hell out here and put a tent\nover this canyon so the mekks could start a farm. And chase King Arthur\non another of his damn fool quests.\nArtur\nhad struggled through a wall of snow and slid down a low sloping wall\ninto the canyon. Ebb heard excited laughter and shouts and doggedly\nfollowed. A moment later he stumbled down the slope and stood next to\nArtur who was wildly gesticulating at the varied shapes of several\nhundred tube trees. They looked like land-locked pipe coral and were as\ngray and white as the surrounding landscape. Their stems reared at\ncrazed angles into the sky. Some stood no taller than a man, others\nloomed several stories. The biggest gave the impression that they had\nbeen there a long, long time.\n\u201cEver\nseen so many, Ebb?\u201d Artur cried.\nEbb\nsnorted. \u201cNo. Not this many. Our mekks will be a month pulling them\nout.\u201d\nArtur\nblinked. \u201cPull them out?\u201d\n\u201cSure.\nCan\u2019t leave these here for the tent farm. Mekks will have no where to\nplant. And the AIs want to get half of the colony away from the Ice\nSea.\u201d\n\u201cBut\nthere are so many. They never grow like this. They must like it here.\u201d\n\u201cToo\nbad. The mekks will pull them.\u201d\n\u201cLong\ntime, for the mekks.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\nand if we don\u2019t deploy them soon we\u2019ll be stuck out here and miss\nYule.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t wanna miss Yule, do you?\u201d\nArtur\nshifted and looked uncomfortable. \u201cI like Yule. But I like tube trees,\ntoo. Bad Christmas for the tube trees.\u201d\n\u201cNo\nChristmas if we don\u2019t get to work.\u201d Ebb turned and headed back\ntoward the reaver wagon. Behind him Artur reached out and stroked a\nknobby, iron-hard branch. A curious look crossed his face. Enchantment.\nThey\nworked steadily for the next few days freeing the wagon and setting up a\ncamp down in the canyon. Artur tried to talk Ebb into saving the tube\ntrees but Ebb would have nothing to do with it. Orders were orders.\nArtur attempted to talk their boss, an AI that called itself Dapper\nFournier, into moving the tent farm to a nearby canyon. Dapper would\nhave none of it and Ebb smirked an I-told-you-so.\nAnd\nso the day came when the mekks were released. Half climbed the canyon\nwalls and began molding pinions and caissons in preparation for the\ntent. The rest moved greedily toward the tube trees. Ebb monitored the\nactivity from a portable hut atop the wagon. High overhead, the ruddy\nflare that was Alpha Centauri B grew steadily brighter in the deep blue\nsky. Every eighty years or so the binary stars Alpha Centauri A and\nAlpha Centauri B came within several billion kilometers of one another,\nwhich was roughly the distance that Saturn orbits the Sun. The planet\nMerlin had experienced this passage since time immemorial. However, this\nwould be the first close approach since the arrival of the humans.\nThe\napproaching star fascinated Ebb. It was one of the few things he\ndidn\u2019t curse about. And he wasn\u2019t the only one who was interested.\nComm and microsat links were limited these days because the AIs had\ndrafted anything with a sensor into observing the nearby companion star.\nMerlin\nrotated slower than Earth and days lasted twenty-seven hours. Night fell\nslowly. The sun eventually slid behind canyon walls and Alpha Centauri B\nsoon followed. The large moon Mordred rose above the mountains to the\neast and cast the world in silver shades. Artur trudged heavily through\nthe snow and climbed into the wagon\u2019s living quarters. He sat heavily\ndown on the bench in the galley. Ebb could see his companion was\nhang-dog and suspected why. The damned tube trees.\n\u201cDinner?\u201d\nEbb offered. He pulled a pair of food paks from storage and pressed\ntheir heater tabs. Warm platters soon appeared on the little table and\nEbb sat down opposite Artur. Ebb pulled a fork from a cubby and began to\nwork on his dinner. Artur ignored his.\n\u201cTwo\nmore days and we head back to Warrick,\u201d Ebb offered.\nArtur\nshrugged.\n\u201cYule\nwill be in full swing.\u201d\nArtur\npicked up a fork and rolled its shaft between thumb and forefinger.\n\u201cLots\nof parties. Lots of presents.\u201d\nArtur\npoked a carrot cube. \u201cShame,\u201d he whispered. \u201cKing Arthur\u2026\u201d\nEbb\nblinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cShame,\nshame, eternal shame, nothing but shame.\u201d\nEbb\nblinked. Once. Twice. And then he laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s not from King\nArthur!\u201d\n\u201cBut\nhe would have said it.\u201d\n\u201cAbout\nthose damned trees?\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d\nEbb\nsighed, exasperated. \u201cNo one cares, Artur. No one. Those tube trees\nare as frozen as ice. They might be fossils for all we know. Better to\nreplace them with something that\u2019s alive.\u201d\n\u201cMerlin\u2019s\ntrees.\u201d\n\u201cMerlin\nis a dead cold planet. It hates life. It has a good atmosphere but\nnothing thrives on the land and only algae and micro-krill live in the\nfrozen sea. Even with a sun that shines half again as bright as\nEarth\u2019s sun, Merlin stays cold. It\u2019s a crazy place and we\u2019re the\nonly good here. Tube trees, moss, and insects are all we ever find.\u201d\n\u201cMoss,\nbugs, tube trees. That\u2019s life.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\npathetic! Just like you wanting to save the damned tube trees! What are\nthey? What are they worth? Nothing!\u201d\nArtur\nblinked back tears. He got up and shambled toward his bunk, fell in, and\npulled the curtain shut. Ebb watched him angrily.\nEbb\nwolfed down his dinner in a heated silence. Then he took a bottle of\nsynth from a shelf and poured several fingers. After a few glasses Ebb\nfelt sorry for Artur. After a few more he really didn\u2019t care. He\npunched a radio to life and listened as a pair of AIs discussed the next\nday\u2019s close approach with Alpha Centauri B. AIs never talked to one\nanother vocally but put on little radio shows for the benefit of the\nslower humans. Tonight they sure seemed interested in that damned second\nsun. Crazy AIs. When the next program featured AIs singing Christmas\ncarols Ebb switched the radio off and listened to the wind moan outside\nthe cabin.\nEbb\nmay have fallen asleep or just lost track of time but at some point in\nthe evening he thought he heard a woman\u2019s voice speaking. This\nstartled him because since hibernation he had had these little episodes\nwhere he occasionally heard voices. This was different, however, as it\nwas a voice not from his past but from his present. He soon realized\nthat it was the contralto of Dapper Fournier. He rubbed his eyes and\nrealized that the voice was coming from Artur\u2019s bunk. Ebb stood and\ntook a few steps toward the curtain. Was Artur still trying to convince\ntheir boss? The fool.\nBut\nwhen he was a meter from the curtain he stopped. Dapper was talking in\nan odd sing-song, like a mother reading her child a story. And\nArthur gave his old friend Galahad a wonderful Christmas gift. But when\nGalahad saw what Arthur had given him he was dismayed! Sire, he asked,\nhow is it that you expect this gift to bear fruit, when all around us\nlay the dead hand of winter\u2026\nEbb\nslowly settled to the moon-stained deck. Sitting cross-legged, he fell\nasleep. The voice of an AI drifted through the cabin as it recited the\nChristmas Tales of King Arthur to a lost and weary human. Ebb dreamed of\nbright stars and warm blankets and a bowl full of cherries. Eventually\nhe tipped back, landed heavily on his back, and awoke to Artur\u2019s\njoyous shouts.\nEbb\nhad the hatch half open before he remembered his thermsuit. He struggled\ninto the garb and boots and then leaped out the door. A passing storm\nhad dropped several centimeters of new snow onto the ground. Ebb\nfollowed Artur\u2019s broken path around the side of the wagon and out onto\nthe canyon floor. An instant later some combination of surprise and\nsynth brought him to his knees.\nThe\ncanyon lay draped in new snow. Where tube-trees once stood gray and dead\nthe world was now transformed by the joyful shout of life. Upon every\nbranch of every tube-tree there blossomed a diaphanous crimson orb.\nThese were layered and fragile and multi-veined with a cluster of black\nnodules knotted upon their peaks. All of the orbs were aimed as if in\ngreeting toward Alpha Centauri B, which burned like a warm coal above\nthe eastern peaks.\nEbb\nfelt a big hand clasp his shoulder and help him to his feet.\nIncredulous, Ebb turned to Artur and asked, \u201cWhat are they?\u201d\n\u201cChristmas\ncherries,\u201d Artur replied matter-of-factly.\n\u201cCherries?\u201d\nEbb didn\u2019t understand.\nArtur\nsmiled. It was a big happy smile. He explained, \u201cLike in the story.\nSir Galahad visits his friend King Arthur on Christmas Eve. As a\npresent, King Arthur gives poor old Sir Galahad a cherry tree to plant.\nBut it\u2019s the dead of winter and Galahad is disappointed. You see it is\na very bad winter and Galahad is old and he thinks he won\u2019t see the\nnext spring. But Galahad is a loyal old knight and he plants it anyway.\nThe next morning Galahad wakes up and the tree is full of cherries!\nChristmas cherries!\u201d\nEbb\nstepped forward. His boot hit a thick branch of one of the tube trees a\nmekk had felled the day before. Aghast, he looked up at Artur.\nArtur\nlaughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Talked to Dapper this morning. She\u2019s very\nexcited. Never thought the tube trees did this. Maybe the new star\ntriggers this flowering once every eighty years. Anyway, she sent all\nthe mekks over to the next canyon. No tube-trees over there.\u201d\nEbb\nlooked back at the canyon. It was as if Merlin had performed a miracle.\nThe planet was alive, and maybe this was a sign it wished to\nshare that life with them.\n\u201cIf\nwe start working the next canyon we won\u2019t get back to Warrick for\nYule,\u201d Ebb said, hoping not to disappoint Artur.\nArtur\nsmiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. This is where I want to spend my Christmas.\u201d\nEnd\nWhen he's not writing, R.\nScott Russell runs a test lab where\nhe is allowed to break things for a living.

I do not remember how I got there. I was left in this beautiful and lonely place when I was old enough to find my food and follow my heart. It always felt like home.\nI never wanted to leave or to find the woman who had given me life. In some ways, the forest was my only mother. There was nothing that I desired that she couldn't give me. I wonder if the earth gave me too much or I wanted too little.\nThe sunlight came inside the canopy of velvet every morning, tempting my eyes to open and drink in the beauty. The air was cold and wet, and gentle on my skin. Everything was still, but so alive. For long moments, my heart would race with indescribable emotions that made my smile grow lovely.\nI would rise from my bed of feathers and flowers, under the base of a banyan tree. I would throw back my slippery raven hair and take in the rising sun. When I felt the heat of the day on me, I would begin my walk through the forest to the steam pool.\nThe walk was very peaceful. The earth was rough and loving under my feet and birds with pretty songs flew with me. I regretted not being able to see the full sun from under my blanket of trees, but enjoyed feeling protected and held. Sometimes, the leaves would fall slowly around me - landing in my hair or by my feet. I would laugh to myself, thinking that my mother had not forgotten me.\nThere was always plenty of food to eat during my walk. Mango trees were perfectly lined on the path, with low fruit ready to pick. I could smell their perfume before taking two - only two. If I took more than my belly could hold, my mother would punish me the next day. If I respected her bounty, I would be provided for.\nAfter the mango trees came the rows of mint leaves that smelled heavily in the air. Only when my teeth felt ill did I ever pick the delightful work of my mother. I would kneel down in the dirt, and pluck the leaves one by one. My hair would often get tangled in the ritual, and I would have to use my knees to free it. The hassle was nothing compared to the taste of mint on my tongue.\nWhen my face was happy with mango and mint, my eyes would feast on the valley of lilies that waited for me each day. They could never bore me with their crimson and yellow dresses that sprung anew in the morning. It was the closest I came to seeing the sun in its high position in the sky. I would roll around in the flowers, careful not to spoil the petals. I only picked the dying ones, because the growing flowers looked happier in the garden than in my hair.\nMy lilies delivered me to my steam pool, placed under the messy coral trees. Even though the water was always warm and soothing, I checked its feel with my toe. I did not trust the water as I did my mother. He could always change his mind and disappear into the ocean. My mother had no choice but to stay with me.\nWith lilies in my hair and earth on my skin, I would slip into the steaming waters to end my day. Every ache or trace of worry that had penetrated my perfect world was washed away as the water grew higher on my body. I had never dipped my head fully into the pool - worrying I\nmight never return to my mother.\nOne day, I discovered something that changed the way I looked at the forest. There were rounded lines forming beneath my waist and my breasts were turning into tender mounds. When I splashed the warm water on my face, I felt a new hardness in my cheeks and jaw. My body felt bigger. More uncertain. More vulnerable to the animals.\nMy heart changed as my body changed. I felt sadness for being alone in the forest and a craving for life. The joy of each morning was gone as my hand traced along the unwelcome swell of my chest. I needed more than my mother could give me.\nSo I went inside the water that seduced me day after day. It took my hair and pushed me under in one glorious embrace. There was warmth everywhere inside me and I wondered why I had never trusted the water before. My black hair floated to the top of the pool while I twisted my body in circles underneath the lulling waves.\nI surged to the top and splattered the water to the coral trees that spit flower petals back at me. I laughed louder than I ever had, having the courage to spread my voice. Something had changed inside me.\nThe day had ended. It was time for me to return to my banyan tree.\n***\nIn the middle of the night, my belly burst. I grabbed my swollen stomach and held the open space between my legs and ran for the steam pool. I could barely move my body, my abdomen was so burdened.\nI ran as fast as I could towards the water. I had never been awake at night before. The darkness scared me.\nThe mango trees heard my cry and lifted their branches. The mint patch disappeared with the night so I could find my way to the water. Finally, I found my place. I fell before the steaming pool. On my knees, begging for mercy. I rolled on the ground next to the water while my stomach stabbed me. I released my hands and a salty bath came rushing out of me.\nI drowned in the water, hoping that the heat would take away the pain. Sinking further and further while bubbles came out of my nose. I raised my arms up in surrender to the moment, letting the pain overcome and consume me. I saw my own blood float up from my hips.\nI stood on my head and opened my legs at the surface of the water. The pain ended with three violent heaves of my belly. I needed to breathe.\nI surged to the top and splattered the water to the coral trees that spit flower petals back at me. I cried harder than I ever had before. Something had changed inside me.\n***\nFor the first time, I slept away from my banyan tree. I spent the night with the water and held his child in my arms.\nI knew my mother was sad that I did not return to her. The coral tree did not shake her flowers at me and the birds did not sing her lullabies. But my heart felt fuller with the water kissing my body and a babe nestled against my bosom.\nShe was as beautiful as my mother, but not as perfect. She needed me completely - from the milk that came so easily from my breasts to the steady rhythm of my heart. I could be complete with her so dependent on my soul.\nWe swam in circles around the steam pool until the sun grew dim. We exchanged laughter and smiles, and I was happy to give my body to the water and my child. There was nothing more we could want.\nWhen the darkness came, I craved my bed by the banyan tree.\nI tried to lift my child out of the water, but he would not let me take her. He turned hard and cold as soon as she was gone. I tried to roll to the coral trees and take her out of the pool. But the water thrashed my hands and feet.\nThe water did not want to lose his child.\nI asked my daughter to follow me back to the banyan tree. If she left the pool of her own will, the water would let her go. She swam in slow circles and looked inside my loving eyes. She could see I wanted her in my life.\nMy daughter chose to stay with the water.\n***\nThe next day, I rose from my bed of feathers and flowers at the base of the banyan tree. All I could think of was my little daughter. There was no happiness without her.\nI went on my usual walk past the mango trees. Today, they offered more fruit. I took it - wanting to feed my baby and myself. I did not think about the next day. Only about the hunger she must feel.\nI did not pick the mint with the care I usually did. I grabbed many, many bunches and stuffed them behind my ears. If I gave my child such a tempting treat, she might follow me back to the banyan tree and fill my heart forever.\nI do not remember seeing the fire colored lilies that day. Only arriving at the pool, where flowers from the coral tree fell over my beautiful daughter. She was smiling up at the sun, and looked at peace in the water.\nI kneeled by the pool and let the mangoes tumble off my breasts. I looked sadly at my child, and asked her if she would like some of the delicious fruit.\nShe had sparkling blue eyes - the color of the pool. She smiled softly at me and took one of the mangoes in her tiny hands. She bit into the fruit and made sounds of contentment.\nI told her there were more mangoes back by my banyan tree. Would she come with me to my nest?\nShe waggled her precious head while sucking down the mango juice like my breast milk. I could feel the tears forming in my eyes.\nI pulled the mint from my ears and offered it to her. Would she come with me to my nest?\nShe accepted the mint with humility and thanked me for the earth's treat. She placed a few leaves on her tongue, but did not answer my question.\nWhy would my daughter not choose to share her life with me? I suffered to bring her to my mother's garden and she refused to join my bed of feathers and flowers. I put my face in the water and wept salty tears.\nMy daughter drank them for nourishment.\n***\nWhen the sun went down, I took the last mango and walked back to my nest without my child. I could barely breathe.\nI saw my lilies again - the ones I had ignored during the day. They were even more heartbreaking at night. The colors were blurry, but I knew there was hidden beauty inside each flower. I touched the petals, and felt my heart fall. I collapsed and cried at the loss of my only child. The flowers listened to my aching, and crept inside my hair.\nI knew I would never go back to my steam pool. It was not mine any longer. I had left a part of me in the water to drown.\nIt was time to return home. To my nest of feathers and flowers at the base of the banyan tree. It was nice to feel the familiar embrace of my mother and know she had not forsaken me during my journey.\nThe next morning, I woke to see a full view of the sun rising to glory in the sky. It was beautiful, just like my daughter. Outside of her mother's grasp.\nEND\n|Saira Ramasastry is the author of the novel Heir\nto Govandhara, which won the 2001 Sapphire Award for best\nSF&F novel with a romantic theme, as well as the Independent\nPublishers Award for Best Romance.\n|\nListen\nto our streaming audio interview with Saira\nRamasastry.\nRead\nour review of Heir to Govandhara.\nReturn\nto Original Fiction.","source":null,"source-hostname":null,"excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/K0CDFU9pV+c25nPbyPJvKHu7Efs.json"}

I was in\nbed, in the big bedroom at the top of the stairs, and he rode right up the\nstaircase on his horse, with his lance and his armour and everything, and\nstood at the end of the bed, with the horse rearing up every now and then,\nand making that kind of gargling sound that horses make, while he talked\nto me. He kept his visor down so that I couldn't see his face, but his\nvoice was very clear and powerful. He said I was never going to see his\nface, and he was right, I never have. He said he would always be there to\nhelp me or any maiden in distress that I might happen to hear about, and\nthat if I liked I could come along with him on some of his adventures.\nWell, you can imagine how I felt about\nthat! I couldn't wait! I said I wanted to go and have an adventure right\naway, and we did! We went to Camelot first and he showed me the castle and\nthe moat and the drawbridge and the round table, and I met Merlin and\nGuinevere and Sir Galahad and I watched them practising sword-fighting and\njousting and having feasts, and Sir Lancelot introduced me to some of the\nmaidens in distress that he had rescued. They had all fallen in love with\nhim of course and would never leave him, but his heart belonged to\nGuinevere and so he wouldn't let them give him a hug or a kiss. I said\nthey could hug me instead, but they didn't seem very interested in that.\nAfter we'd been in Camelot for a while\nwe went riding, with me sitting behind Sir Lancelot on the back of the\nsaddle, and we found a maiden who was being kept prisoner in a tower by a\nhorrible one-eyed giant about ten feet tall. Sir Lancelot told him he had\nbetter let her go if he didn't want to be put to the sword. That's what\nknights do to you if you're bad, they put you to the sword. Needless to\nsay, the giant wouldn't let the maiden go, so Sir Lancelot had to put him\nto the sword. Then the maiden fell in love with Sir Lancelot and wanted to\nstay with him forever. He didn't want her, of course. He didn't seem to\nwant to live with maidens, just rescue them. Like I said, his heart\nbelonged to Guinevere. Speaking for myself, I would have been content with\none or two of the maidens.\nEven though we'd been away for days and\ndays we were able to get back to my bedroom by morning. That was because\nMerlin could do magic, of course. My parents never knew that I had been\naway.\nHe came back other nights and we went on\nother adventures. Sometimes he rode right up the stairs like he did on the\nfirst night and sometimes he would leave the horse out on the driveway. I\nused to look down at it in the moonlight, a beautiful pure-white stallion,\nnibbling the lawn and making that little gargling sound again.\nWe fought and killed a dragon - put it\nto the sword because it had been eating virgins, which are a kind of\nmaiden. It was a very big dragon, bigger than a red London bus. Another\ntime we found a witch who was casting evil spells that made women give\nbirth to dead babies, and stopped the cows giving any milk. We had to burn\nher at the stake, like on Bonfire Night, because that's the only way you\ncan kill a witch. If you put them to the sword they just come back to life\nagain.\nEven after my father left my mother. Sir\nLancelot kept coming to pick me up at night and taking me out on\nadventures. In fact I think he came even more often after Dad left. He\nnever wakened my mother, she never heard the armour rattling or the feet\non the stairs or the horse making that little gargling sound. And I was\nalways back in my bed before the morning.\nThen Larry came, and started visiting my\nmother. He had a very loud voice and didn't treat her very nicely, but she\nseemed to like him nevertheless. They used to go out drinking, and they\nwould come back, him talking loudly and laughing quite a lot, and\nsometimes he would stay until the morning. I noticed that he used to hold\nher quite tightly by the shoulder, and once I saw him throw her down on\nthe sofa very roughly. And he wasn't laughing that night. Dad was never\nrough with Mum like that. He knew how you were supposed to treat maidens.\nI was worried about Larry. I didn't like him.\nThe next time I saw Sir Lancelot I asked\nhim about my mum and Larry. He agreed with me. He said that Larry sounded\nlike the kind of man who deserved to be put to the sword. So I reminded\nhim that he had said he would help me if ever I needed help, or if ever I\ncame across a maiden in distress, and this seemed to fit both\ndescriptions. I know my mother was a bit old to be a maiden, but Sir\nLancelot said that that didn't matter and it was definitely a case for\nputting to the sword. But he couldn't use Excalibur because that was a\nspecial sacred sword. He would need an ordinary sword for Larry. I had a\nlook in the kitchen and found a small sword, about nine or ten inches\nlong. Sir Lancelot said that would be all right. So we waited for them\njust inside the door that night and Sir Lancelot did what had to be done.\nMy mum didn't see Sir Lancelot putting\nLarry to the sword because it was so dark, and she just ran out screaming\nand screaming. She couldn't really remember anything about it afterwards,\nand because of this people seemed to get the idea that it had been my dad\nwho had put Larry to the sword. I told them it wasn't, that it had been\nSir Lancelot, but they wouldn't listen to me. They said I had just been in\nbed and had dreamt about Sir Lancelot. So there was nothing I could do. I\ncouldn't stop them from putting Dad in prison.\nMy mum started to cry quite a bit after\nthat and she let me sleep in her bed a lot of the time. I didn't like it\nwhen my mum cried. Sir Lancelot couldn't come of course while I was in her\nbed.\nMy mum and I went to visit Dad in prison\nabout once a month. I sometimes managed to get a few minutes on my own\nwith him while she went to the toilet or something, and when I did I tried\nto explain to him about Sir Lancelot. It was no good trying to talk about\nSir Lancelot while Mum was there because she didn't approve of me talking\nabout Larry's death. She thought it was too upsetting for me and I should\ntry to forget about it. But Dad listened, and as time went by I think he\nbegan to understand more about what I was trying to explain to him.\nHe made some kind of arrangement with\nthe people in the prison, for me to explain about Sir Lancelot to a woman\nnamed Dr. Sherman. Dr. Sherman was the first adult who really listened\nproperly to what I was saying about Sir Lancelot. She asked a lot of\nquestions and she wrote everything down. I had several talks with Dr.\nSherman, and then she sent me to another doctor, a man-doctor named Nigel\nBarry. He asked me to call him Nigel, which was strange for a doctor.\nNigel believed me about Sir Lancelot. So did Dr. Sherman. They were like\nSir Lancelot, they rescued Dad from the prison. He was allowed to go home\nto Mum, and they're still together, living happily ever after.\nBut they haven't let me go home. At\nleast not so far. They've put me in prison instead, in a tower in a big\nhouse, a kind of castle, where they have a torture chamber in the cellar,\nand lots of people, both men and maidens, in little cells like this one.\nI've been here a very long time now.\nLonger than any of the others I think. I can remember a lot of Christmas\ndinners, so that must mean I've been here a lot of years. Five or a\nhundred years. Something like that. Mum and Dad used to visit me a lot at\nthe beginning, but I don't see much of them now.\nThe people here have told me that I may\nbe allowed to go home some day, but it doesn't sound to me like they think\nit's going to be very soon. There's something extremely odd going on in\nthis place. Nobody's allowed to leave, and the doctors and nurses torture\nthem all day long, so that some of them have gone completely crazy. My mum\nand dad say that they're trying to help me, but I can't see it. The only\nhelp I need is help to get out of here. You'd think Dad would understand,\nhaving been imprisoned himself.\nOf course what they don't know is that I\ncan get out of here any time I like, because there's someone who really\nwill help me - Sir Lancelot! He can come and visit me again now, because I\nhave a bedroom all to myself. It's just one floor down from the very top\nof the tower. But he says it isn't time just yet. He wants me to spy for\nhim first, find out what's going on here, what the doctors are doing to\npeople. That's all right with me. I'm a very good spy.\nThe Head doctor, Dr, Karl Leeman, is an\nevil wizard who scares everybody and and makes them go mad sometimes. He\nmade Cecil kill himself by cutting his wrists while he was having a bath,\nand he made Lorraine have a fit and crack her head on the wall of the\nlaundry room. Lots of stuff like that happens here. Nurse Gunn, the one\nwho talks with a funny accent, she's a witch and she's in charge of the\ntorture chamber in the cellar. There's a maiden named Judith who lives\njust above me - in the top room in the tower - and Nurse Gunn takes her\ndown to the torture chamber every time she cries. And Judith cries a lot.\nThey tie her up and chain her to a table and then they give her electric\nshocks. After she's been down there you don't see her for a while. You\ndon't hear her either. She's probably too frightened to do anything but\nlie in bed after she's been down there. I've told Judith that if she\ndoesn't cry then maybe they won't give her electric shocks, but she\ndoesn't want to talk about it. Judith has long brown hair and big dark\neyes and she's very pretty. She's so pretty I think she might be a\nprincess instead of a maiden. Yes, I'm certain she's a princess. Maybe\nthat's why she won't let me kiss her. I've tried and she doesn't like it.\nNot everybody is allowed to kiss a princess. Just princes, I think, and\nknights. I'm sure she'll kiss Sir Lancelot all right.\nI've got a whole list of people now that\nSir Lancelot is going to have to put to the sword. There's Dr. Leeman of\ncourse, and Dr. Patel and Charge Nurse Robinson and Nurse Fowler and Nurse\nGunn. Of course Nurse Gunn is a witch so she'll have to be burned at the\nstake. Maybe some of the others as well, it's hard to be sure. Sir\nLancelot will know the right thing to do.\nWhen the men were here painting the\ncorridors I stole this little plastic container of something called\n\"turpentine substitute.\" It says on the label that it's\n\"highly inflammable\" and there's a little picture of a flame,\nand a stake. I have it hidden in my secret compartment. Behind the piece\nof white stuff that they used to block off the old fireplace in my room.\nIf you know where to pull it it comes right out and there's a space behind\nit like a little cupboard. I'm the only one who knows about it. I've got\nother things in there as well. There's a sword that I made for Sir\nLancelot so that he wouldn't have to use Excalibur. I made it out of an\niron bar that the workmen left behind the time that they had the\nscaffolding at the back of the main building. I got a hard black stone as\nwell and I've been sharpening it with that. Both edges. It took a very\nlong time, but it's ready now. It's ready for Sir Lancelot when he needs\nit. And I've got matches, and old newspapers and dry twigs and bits of\nwood. Things that Sir Lancelot will need for burning witches. I think it\nmight be best for him to burn everyone here after he's put them to the\nsword, just to be on the safe side.\nHe'll rescue Princess Judith of course.\nI'm not sure if he's rescued any princesses before, but he probably has.\nThat's even better than rescuing maidens. After she's rescued, Princess\nJudith won't have to cry any more. Maybe Sir Lancelot will marry her\ninstead of Guinevere. I think she's prettier than Guinevere.\nHey! Guess what! I've just heard Sir\nLancelot's armour rattling somewhere near by and I've had a look out the\nwindow. His horse is down in the car park, chewing at some of the leaves\nin the flower-bed. You can see it by the light of the big lamp in the\nmiddle.\nSir Lancelot must be just outside on the\nstairs, waiting for me. I'd better get the sword, and the turpentine\nsubstitute, and all the other things - he's got a lot of work to do.\nDon't worry Princess Judith! Don't cry\nany more! It's almost over now. We're going to be free! And happy ever\nafter.\nI'm ready, Sir Lancelot! It's time for\nall this evil to be swept away!","source":null,"source-hostname":null,"excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/aOTt52P27yLXTiR+oxb184o3--U.json"}

As prisons go, it's\nalmost cozy. A long time ago, this campus was a\nschool. Then, late in the last century, it was made\ninto a minimum security facility. There are no bars\nanywhere. I may have as many blankets as I want. I\nsleep in a private room equipped with a wooden chair\nand an antique writing desk. I am encouraged to\nwrite my thoughts and feelings. I am free to roam\nthe grounds, which are maintained by professional\ngardeners now that there isn't sufficient prison\nlabor to do the job. I can walk right to the\nwater's edge and look across at the forested slopes\nof the Norwegian mainland. But that's as far as I\ncan go. If I stepped into the water, my transponder\nwould alert the guards. They would rush to prevent\nmy suicide. That's what they'd think, that I was\ntrying to drown myself. The water is cold for\nswimming.\nThe prison governor herself\nsummons me for a visit in her office every week.\nShe always asks if I have any complaints about how I\nam being treated, as if I were a tourist here on\nUlvsnes\u0159y Island.\nI am cold all the time, but\nthat's hardly worth mentioning. Instead I tell her,\n\"I'm going to die. You people have sentenced me to\ndeath.\"\n\"There is no death penalty\nhere,\" she says.\n\"There is for me.\"\nAt my next therapy session, the\ntherapist asks if I am contemplating suicide.\n\"Did the governor tell you\nthat? She doesn't understand. You don't\nunderstand. My sentence is a death sentence, even\nif that isn't what the court had in mind.\"\n\"You won't die,\" he says. \"But\na lot will probably have changed by the time you are\nresuscitated. People you know may have died in the\ninterim. The world will have changed. Change can\nbe traumatic. It's understandable.\"\nI glare at him. \"You don't get\nit! You don't understand the first thing about\nmy...crimes.\" Then I hug myself for warmth. He\nkeeps his office too cool.\n\"So explain it to me,\" he says.\nI do. I explain it all. When I\nhave finished, he tells me that he's not worried.\nHe's not worried! Well, he's not going to be\nfrozen, is he?\nI try to tell the physician who\nregularly checks my health and tests my reaction to\nsmall samples of the chemicals they will use.\n\"You're killing me,\" I say.\n\"You're in good health.\"\n\"I will die.\"\n\"We have never botched a\nresuscitation,\" he says. \"You'll be fine.\" Then he\ntells me to hold still for a subcutaneous injection\nof a micro-crystalizing agent. \"We want to make\nsure you aren't allergic. This may sting a little.\"\nI am running out of time. My\nprocedure is tomorrow. They will freeze me solid\nand then move me to a storage facility in Vads\u0159.\nEven Vads\u0159 thaws in the summer.\nThe only person who might\nunderstand is Sponheim, the Corrections\nSociologist. He just arrived. It's his job to\nunderstand me thoroughly and to write a report that\nhis successors will use to decide if it's safe to\nrevive me. His report will help them decide if I am\nno longer a threat to society because society has\nchanged enough to deal with me, or has learned to\ntreat behaviors like mine.\n\"I am already remorseful!\" I\ntell him at our first interview. \"I won't do it\nagain!\" We are sitting at a table by the water. A\nlight mist falls. \"I shouldn't have done it,\nshouldn't even have thought about it. Once, I was\none of the people fighting to preserve the last wild\npolar bears! I wanted to protect the earth!\" I get\nmyself worked up. I am close to tears.\nSponheim checks the screen on\nhis handheld. \"Your sentence calls for a review of\nyour case every ten years. Ten years isn't that\nlong.\"\n\"I'll die! You don't\nunderstand!\"\n\"Make me understand,\" he says.\n\"Start at the beginning.\"\nThe beginning. The very\nbeginning? That would start with growing up on the\nwestern edge of Boulder, Colorado, right against the\nfoothills. Our street dead-ended at the trail head\nfor a mountain park. Deer visited our yard so often\nthat my mother gave up on trying to have a garden.\nI saw a bear once from my bedroom window. My father\nand I hiked the trails together until I was old\nenough to go out alone. When fresh snow fell, my\nfootprints were usually the first ones on the trail.\nOr maybe the beginning came when\nI knew that the mountains of Colorado weren't quite\nparadise. Some of the deer suffered a wasting\ndisease that no one could explain. Every summer,\nmore and more bears came into town because drier\nwinters made for poor foraging in the mountains.\nThe authorities tagged the bears and relocated them,\nbut since there still wasn't sufficient food in the\nback country, the bears would find their way back\ninto town. To be shot dead.\nBefore I was out of high school,\nI understood that the earth was in trouble. I\ncarried signs. I unfurled banners. At twenty, I\ndropped out of college to live on handouts and\nprotest full-time. What was the point of studying\nmolecules when whole species were going extinct?\nWith like-minded people, I traveled to Churchill,\nManitoba, to bring attention to the late arrival of\nthe snow pack. But we were too late. Canadian\nwildlife officials had already captured the\nremaining bears so they wouldn't starve.\nSigns and banners weren't\nenough. I started to spike trees, set fire to new\nconstruction, and destroy machinery.\n\"As I understand it,\" Sponheim\nsays, \"when you hide a spike in a tree, you endanger\nthe lives of sawmill operators. Yes? Is this\nappropriate?\"\nI look at him. He is\nhalf-smiling in a friendly way, encouraging me to\nkeep talking.\n\"So what?\" I said.\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"Why should people be more\nimportant than any other species?\u201d I don\u2019t try to\nhide my anger. \u201cYou asked me to start at the\nbeginning. Maybe that's it. The real beginning is\nwhen I started to hate people.\"\nIt wasn't a great jump from\nloving the earth to hating people. Before I had\ndropped out of college, I learned that every so\noften, a super-disruptive species evolves. A\nsuper-predator, say, that is so successful that it\nhunts out the very populations it depends on. It\nfeeds itself to death.\nAren't we like that, we human\nbeings? We are everywhere, crowding out other\nspecies except for those that are like us, from our\nsongbird-eating cats to Caulerpa taxifolia.\n\"Caulerpa?\" says Sponheim.\n\"A macro algae,\" I tell him. \"An\naquarium plant that was accidentally released into\nthe Mediterranean. Like human beings, it is too\nsuccessful. It crowds out everything else. Diverse\nmarine meadows become deserts of Caulerpa.\"\n\"Ah, yes. I have heard of it.\"\n\"You should have. It will wipe\nout the last commercial fishing in the Mediterranean\nin five years. Maybe sooner.\"\nWhat I hated was our arrogance,\nas if it didn\u2019t matter what we did. When rich\npeople started freezing themselves when they got\nsick, taking up space and energy to stay around\nuntil they could be cured, I couldn\u2019t stand it any\nmore.\nHumanity was headed for a\ncliff. One day, we\u2019d look down expecting to see the\nweb of life that had always sustained us, and there\nwould be almost nothing there. A biosphere that\ncould support ten billion of us would be gone. What\nwas left might feed ten millions. Ten million very\nsorry people.\nAnd if that was where we were\nheaded anyway, why not speed things up? Why fight\nit? In fact, why not hasten the end so that I could\nsee people coming to realize what they had done?\nLittle by little, I began to formulate a plan.\nLittle by little, I began to find companions who\nwere as frustrated as I was, who were as sick of\nfighting human nature.\n\"Did you consider,\" Sponheim\nsays, \"the fate of the people who would starve?\"\nI don't answer. I look out\nacross the water. The truth is, I used to have\nfantasies about families in big houses with nice\nfurniture fighting to the death for a crust of\nbread. Spread and consume. Spread and consume.\nSee where it gets you.\nWhen I continue my silence, he\nsays, \"Did you expect that you would survive?\"\nAgain, I don't want to say. We\ndid lay in supplies. We planned to live long enough\nat least to gloat. Perhaps we would even endure the\nwhole crisis and emerge as the people who would seed\na new race that scratched out a bare subsistence and\nlived in fearful awe of the earth.\n\"What exactly did you do?\"\n\"It's in the trial transcripts.\"\n\"Yes,\" Sponheim agrees. \"But I\nwant to hear it from you.\"\nWe did our work in greenhouses,\nhidden deep in the Norwegian forest. The plants we\ngrew were all species that were already creating\necological havoc somewhere. Caulerpa taxifolia\nin the Mediterranean sea. Knapweed on the\nrangelands of North America. Japanese knotweed\nalong European rivers. Dangerous exotics.\nWe made them more dangerous. We\nbred Kudzu that could survive harder frosts. We\nmade Knapweed poisonous to the insects that were\nused to control its spread. Our Caulerpa\ncould grow in waters as cold as the North Sea.\nOnce our plants were well\nestablished, vast expanses of rangeland would become\nuseless for grazing\u2014poisonous for horses and too\nbitter for cattle to eat. Fisheries would collapse\nas Caulerpa overgrew productive seabeds. Waterfowl\nwould starve while foraging in wetlands choked with\npurple loosestrife.\nSponheim says, \"I don't doubt\nthat you would have caused trouble, you and your\ncompatriots, by releasing those plants.\"\n\"Nothing less than total\neconomic collapse,\" I tell him. \"When it happens,\nit will make the Great Depression look like a walk\nin the park.\"\n\"Ah, but your operation was\nraided. You were shut down. Your plants, your\ngreenhouses and aquariums were all destroyed.\"\n\"Everything physical, yes.\nYou're right. That was all destroyed. But our\nideas...\" I look him in the eye. \"Our ideas are\nout. They're everywhere.\"\nSponheim frowns. \"I see. But\nit takes someone to implement them.\"\n\"Do you think I'm so rare? Or\nmy anger? Do you think my anger is unique?\"\n\"Not unique among your fellow\nconspirators,\" he says. \"But in the general\npopulation...\"\n\"Let me tell you, I had little\ntrouble finding such people. There are others.\nPerhaps they are already at work. Some of them will\nbe smarter than I am, better than I was at making\ninvasive plants worse.\u201d\nSponheim looks skeptical.\n\u201cSuppose, then, that no one does\ntake up our cause. All right. Then the disaster\nwill take fifty years, not ten or twelve. It will\nstill come, don\u2019t you see? And if I\u2019m still\nfrozen? When the fishing boats return with a\ntwentieth of their catch, when farm yields drop and\nhunters nearly always come home with empty hands,\nhow long do you think Norway will continue to keep\nelectricity in the power grid? How long do you\nthink you'll keep me safely frozen? If civilization\nas we know it fails, I will thaw. Not a proper\nthaw. Just a power failure. I will die.\"\n\"It... It doesn't seem likely to\nme. People do want to solve these problems.\"\n\"You should be able to tell\nsomeone how sorry I am. There should be some sort\nof appeal.\"\n\"Appeals are strictly limited,\"\nSponheim says.\n\"Please.\"\n\"But you see, it's out of my\nhands, really. We have a justice system that\ndoesn't drag matters out. In the whole scheme of\nthings, the prisoner loses so little by being frozen\nfor ten years, or even a hundred.\"\n\"One hundred years?\u201d\n\"Even if your remorse is\ngenuine, society has a right to protect itself.\"\n\"And if ecological collapse\ncomes in the meantime?\"\nSponheim considered me. He\nturned off his handheld. He looked out over the\nwater, then back at me. \"In that case,\" he said, \"I\nwill consider you lucky. You won't feel a\nthing.\"\nAbout the author: Bruce Holland\nRogers has won a Pushcart Prize, the World Fantasy\nAward, and two Nebula Awards, among other honors.\nHe teaches fiction writing for the Whidbey Writers\nlow-residency MFA, and teaches\nwriting seminars in\nGreece\nand\nItaly.

As I watched from the light booth, I was amazed to see that she continued her monologue hanging upside down:\n\"... being o'er my head, as is a winged messenger of heaven unto the white-upturned wondering eyes of mortals that fall back to gaze on him when he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds and sails upon the bosom of the air ...\" The words cut off as she fell into the orchestra pit. I winced, as she bounced once -- no, twice. It was a good thing that I had decided not to use live music, I thought.\nThe audience screamed en-masse. I wasn't sure if it was from fear or from enjoyment. I was relieved when I started hearing the chortles, guffaws, and the sound of thunder clapping made by hundreds of tentacles slapping together. I guess that they all thought it was part of the play. Romeo and Juliet and the Three Stooges \u2026\nRomeo looked around, not sure how to ad-lib himself out of this one. I thought that he looked relieved that her 250 kilos hadn't landed on him.\nI made my way back stage, terrified. This wasn't good. If the show flopped, I wouldn't get paid. If I didn't get paid, I couldn't afford to get off of O'Goora, this no-nothing, loser of a planet. I had almost managed it\nthree years before. I was rehearsing what I thought was going to be a tremendous hit. The play Equus was right up the O'Goorasian's ally. Large O'Goorasian actors play telor beasts that get maimed and some of the other lead characters strip right down to green scales. The play had it all. Opening night, my lead caught the Tesian flu and we were forced to cancel the show. After that, my career as a director on O'Goora was pretty pathetic.\nOrgla was sobbing backstage. I had cast her as Juliet, because for an O'Goorasian, she was young, not more than a hundred years or so. I was shocked when I saw her. Her color, normally green, was orange. I couldn't remember if orange meant pain, rage, or embarrassment. Perhaps it meant all three. Even after being on the planet for six years, I still wasn't so good at figuring out which color meant what.\n\"Ghhah, ghhha ...\" she said.\n\"Are you all right?\" I asked, patting her tentacle, and already knowing the answer.\n\"Noooo!\" She snuffled, shaking her great transparent, orange head.\nShe was holding one side of it. Some green matter oozed out.\n\"Well, the show must go on,\" I said, hopefully. They took her away in an ambulance. The audience shuffled off, unhappy that the fun was over and generally surprised that the fall hadn't been part of the play.\nThe rest of the actors packed it up and went home.\nI sat stewing in Orgla's dressing room when Jordaf showed up.\n\"Director, we must cancel de show,\" he said, sitting his massive seven-foot bulk into Orgla's ornate chair. I shook my head at him, as I tried to figure out what his colors meant. His scales, a bright, reddish-green color, could indicate anger or maybe just unhappiness.\n\"No, Orgla's okay,\" I said, trying not to sound too desperate.\n\"I says that Orgla not gonna be okay,\" shouted Jordaf, showing his two layers of sharp teeth.\" Okay, I thought. Reddish-green definitely meant anger.\n\"You say we had hit with this play. Jordaf spend lots of credits on set and costumes.\" Jordaf leaned over so that I could smell his fetid breath. \"Alan owes Jordaf.\" Jordaf's reptilian-like yellow eyes blinked at me. Owe can mean so many things to an O'Goorasian. A horrific thought came to me. I might become the O'Goorasian's dinner. After all, he might consider that a fair deal.\n\"Well, um, I could bring in the understudy,\" I said.\n\"Understudy?\"\n\"Yeah. She's been standing in the wings just waiting for Orgla to get sick.\"\n\"Understudy not on payroll,\" said Jordaf, suspiciously.\n\"Yeah, I know. Her contract says that she only gets paid when Orgla bites the dust and she goes on stage to perform.\"\n\"Ah, contract!\" His eyes gleamed, and his scales turned blue. I knew that I was talking his language then. Producers all spoke the same language, no matter what planet you were on.\n\"Yeah, she'll be great! I'm sure that she'll be up to speed tomorrow night, no problem.\" Jordaf was pacified. I shook one of his tentacles before he left.\nI looked over at Orgla's great mirror. I hadn't realized how shaken I was. My face was a chalky white, a stark contrast to my dark beard. I sat down in a small chair that fitted my 5'11 frame and put my head in my hands. I didn't have any understudies. I could have, but I had decided to save the money. Going home was one thing, but going home in style was quite another. I figured with the money that I saved I could travel first class. It now looked uncertain that I'd make it home at all.\nI sat up, reaching into my pocket to pull out the small com-cone. I stuck it into the port, thinking that Orgla had a pretty nice dressing room. Not too many of them came with com-ports. I punched in my email number.\n\"You have one message, delivered on Sunday, May 4, at 8:00 IPT. Sent by Annie Gates, New York City, Earth. COD.\" Great, I thought. Big producer and it's going to cost me. Credits on delivery, my ass. I reluctantly punched Receive and Annie's face popped up on screen.\nThe O'Goorasian screen was large and Annie's sharp features filled the screen. Her blond hair was arranged tightly in a bun. The bright red chopstick holding the bun together stuck out far, disappearing off of the screen. I couldn't see what she was wearing; it was some off of the shoulder thing. It must be cut low, I thought. Cut very low. I really had to get home.\n\"Stephen, darling!\" She said, her voice sounding syrupy and sweet. I sighed heavily. She always over did it.\n\"I thought I made it perfectly clear in my last message.\" Her bright red lips pursed together tightly when she said \"perfectly.\"\n\"If you don't make it to New York within the next month, I shall have to choose another director. Oh, and I really do want you, you do know that darling? You're the best. Ta.\"\n\"280 credits have been charged to your account,\" said the computer, in its smug, tinny voice. The screen went blank.\nWell, she really wasn't begging me to come and direct her show. But being asked twice by Annie was close to it. I had to get home.\nThe next night, the theatre was full. From way above the stage in the light booth, I caught glints and flashes of tentacles and teeth in the audience. Larn the techie was sitting at the board, obviously enjoying himself. He was very amiable for an O'Goorasian, and hadn't minded staying up with me all night to set up the holoactor. The glob of synth was the most difficult part to put together. Larn had mixed it just right. You couldn't see any of the synth, because the holoactor reflected off of the moving blob perfectly.\nAs the show started, I sat with the script in hand. I knew all of Juliet's lines, but didn't want to chance it. As Juliet made her first entrance, I took a moment to admire Larn's skill. I didn't think anyone would know that Juliet was just a holo projection of an O'Goorasian. He had done such a good job; I could see some of the members of the audience consulting their programs to determine who the actress was. The play was going well and I wasn't messing up any of the lines. I was delighted that as I said the lines, the words came out of the holoactor's mouth. It was like listening to my own voice when I was about nine.\nDuring intermission, I went backstage. Romeo was sweating, his large green mass giving off an unpleasant odor.\n\"Good Juliet,\" he said, smiling, his white sharp teeth gleaming. I nodded. Romeo was being very polite. Actors usually hated working with holoactors.\nThe audience had loved the sword fights, as I knew they would. They had enjoyed all of the thunderous bodies of the O'Goorasian actors bouncing around the stage. That was why I'd picked the play in the first place.\nIt was almost the end of the play. The Juliet holoactor was lying on the tomb, her tentacles draping gracefully over the stone. Romeo was lying dead next to her. The holoactor at this point was supposed to rise up, see that Romeo was dead, and then kill itself. After a few long moments, I looked over at Larn. He was sweating.\n\"What's wrong?\" I asked, first making sure that my mike was covered.\n\"I don't know!\" he said. \"The holoactor's not responding.\" I turned off my mike as I looked down at the audience, only to catch Jordaf staring up at me. His eyes glinted and he looked hungry.\n\"Uh oh,\" said Larn.\n\"What?\" I asked, looking at the stage. The holoactor was expanding. \"What's it doing?\" I asked, trying to keep the sound of panic out of my voice.\n\"Jordaf must have gotten this holo equipment cheap. And like I said last night, it's pretty old, too,\" said Larn.\nThe holoactor was rising up and up, like a large helium balloon. And then it exploded. The pink slime from the synth-material went everywhere, covering the stage. Romeo jumped up roaring, and dashed off left stage. The audience members in the front row were covered with the stuff. And then the applause, and rumbles, and growls of appreciation started. I looked down at the audience, amazed. They loved it. It was a big hit. Larn reached out a tentacle to me and I shook it. As I looked out onto the stage, some of the actors gingerly walked out to take their curtain calls, trying to avoid the slime. Romeo came out last, smiling magnificently, as he wiped the pink slime off of his scales with his tentacles.\nSometime later, Jordaf sat in my small office. He was leaning back in his chair, looking rather smug.\n\"Dis Shakespeare thing you got is one big hit,\" he said.\n\"Yeah! Larn's putting the new holoactor together,\" I said. \"It's a good thing we've only got a one-week run! He's not going to get much sleep this week.\"\n\"One week run?\" he asked as he reached into his robe and pulled out a small com-cone. \"You not read your contract,\" said the O'Goorasian.\n\"What?\" I said.\n\"Look\nat de contract,\" he said smugly. He reached over, sticking the com-cone into the port. He pointed to the tiniest of print on the screen.\nSquinting, I read: \"The Director agrees that should the play be a success (as determined by the undersigned Producer), the director is required to stay for the length of the play's run. (The play's run to be determined by the undersigned Producer.)\nI stared at him and swallowed hard. \"Well, it can't be a long run, can it?\"\n\"Your life-span is short for a biped. How long could it run?\" The O'Goorasian shrugged, his tentacles bobbing up and down, and then smiled, his sharp teeth curling out from under his lips.\nEND\n|About the Author: Although Brenda\nChapman has sold a number of\n|\nnonfiction articles to a local newspaper, this is her first\nscience fiction\ncontest entry and the first science fiction she's had\npublished!

Tiedemann \u00a9 2006\nTo land in Baltiplex all you have to do is contract\none of the Incurables--herpes carcinoma, syphilis3,\nAIDS II, a nonrecoverable drug dependency--or be an\nembarrassment to someone important. The lie is that\nvery few of them are incurable, but it has become\neasier to deal with our lepers by interring them in\na coventry where we can't see them and don't have to\ndeal with them. Baltiplex is the repository of\nbetrayed, the end point of deception. Baltiplex is\nwhere the refuse gets dumped.\nOf\ncourse, one's definition of refuse often must be\nfluid and somewhat parochial at times to make sense\nof the inmates.\nThe Plex itself isn't bad. Once it was a\ncitadel of the elite, a hightech arcology that a\nterrorist turned into a self-contained hell with a\ntailored virus. It's magnificent, even in eclipse.\nEverything is still automated, self-repairing, and\neven\nthe buzz squads of crazed motiles\nthat keep trying can't break enough drones or smash\nthe dispatch centers. Maybe one of these years\nthey'll manage to disrupt service, but I doubt most\nof them will live long enough.\nThe management company cleaned the place up\nafter the virus ate itself out, then tried to\nsolicit new tenants. No one was interested.\nBaltiplex was a haunted arcology. The government\nmade them an offer and they sold it. The Bureau of\nHealth took over and the first \"residents\" were\nadmitted a year later.\nI was thrown in the Plex for being an\nembarrassment. The logistics of caring for eight\nplus billion people yearly become more and more like\nan elaborate dance designed to distract attention\nfrom the fact that the legs are giving out and the\ncontinuing process of robbing-him-to-pay-her just\ncan't last forever. Still, as much as most people,\nespecially those putatively \"in charge\", would like\nto see a few hundred million others disappear here\nand there, when unexplained disappearances do\noccur everyone worries. Two impulses seize all\ngovernments: find out where these people are going\nand keep the rest of humanity from learning about\nit. I violated the second impulse. My reward was a\nresidency in the Plex. If I had found an answer to\nthe first I might have survived in finer\nsurroundings. My friend Smithy constantly teased me\nfor my naivet\u00e9.\n\"Shouldn't o' figured anybody'd listen,\nFisher.\"\nI shrugged. \"There's a report somewhere, on\nfile in a dozen places, that'll bubble to the\nsurface one of these days.\"\n\"By then you'll be dead, like the rest of us.\"\nHe laughed and coughed. \"God, I gotta find some\ngrease.\"\nWe were walking down an empty corridor. On\neither side apartments rose in canyonlike slopes.\nOccasionally a face would appear at a\nwindow--strained, sore-ridden, ravaged--and then\ndisappear.\n\"Where're we goin'?\" Smithy asked.\n\"I want to show you something.\"\n\"Some grease?\"\nI scowled. \"No women, Smithy. This is\ndifferent.\"\nHe chuckled dryly. \"Who says it's gotta be\nfemale? How come you never get greased? I never\nsee you with anyone.\"\nI shook my head. \"I'm not interested in adding\nnew diseases to my condition.\"\n\"Oh, like you think you're ever gonna get outta\nhere? C'mon! You gotta know there ain't no out\nof the Plex! Have some fun while you're still\nalive!\"\n\"There are a few terminals in here that can\nkill you in an hour, Smithy. I thought you liked\nbeing alive.\"\nHe shrugged again. \"Where we goin'?\"\nI studied Smithy as we walked. I had known him\nOutside, long ago. We had worked together once.\nFew people in our profession are as romantic as the\nfictions the ignorant write about us. In fact,\nSmithy is about the only one I ever knew who could\ncome close to matching the color of the fantasies.\nA slight man, deceptively frail-looking, he had\nsaved our lives on a feeling that something was\ngoing wrong and got us out of a bad place by the\nmost byzantine of routes. I used to think that if\nanyone could have found a way out of the Plex,\nSmithy would have been the one. But even he wasn't\nup to the challenge and he grew weaker by the\nmonth. I don't think he cared anymore.\n\"What's the thing that's most aggravating to\nyou about being in here, Smithy?\"\n\"Open sores.\"\n\"Seriously.\"\nHe looked up the walls of apartments. \"I don't\nknow...I guess the way it's overcrowded...and you\nstill don't see people, y'know? I mean, the Plex is\ndesigned to house two million, right? There's four\nand a half million of us in here. Where are they?\nGo in toward the center, where the clubs and shit\nare, there's people. But it don't look like\nfour and a half million. You can feel 'em,\nbut...I don't know. What about you?\"\n\"I didn't get to meet a novasoph.\"\n\"Aw, the aliens? You wanted to see\none?\"\nI nodded.\n\"Yuch!\"\n\"They arrived two months before I was\ninterred. Officially, anyway. I never could\nconvince myself that they hadn't been around a lot\nlonger.\" They were made public about when my report\non unexplained disappearances in Africa and Asia\nbegan winding its way through channels, I thought.\nThe timing of that had always bothered me--well,\neverything about it bothered me--and I finally\njust put it down to the Powers That Be wanting to\nput on a clean face for our new visitors. It\nwouldn't do to have a high profile investigator\nraising embarrassing questions about where all the\nbodies were buried.\n\"You were the one hadda write a\nreport that got you in here! I told you a\ndozen times, pursuit of the truth is foolish and\ndangerous and futile. Kind of like love, eh?\" He\nlaughed and it turned to a hacking cough. He spit\nand cleared his throat. \"Where the hell are we goin'?\"\n\"Right up here.\"\nI stopped us before a big steel door. A red\nwarning label said NO ADMITTANCE DRONE ACCESS.\nBeside it was a scanner. I looked up and down.\nHabit--no one around here could do what I did,\nbut...\nI pulled my ID chit from my pocket. I had\nmodified it slightly. I shoved it against the\nscanner and waited. A few seconds later the door\nslid open. Smithy whistled.\n\"I fool the scanner into thinking I'm a\nmaintenance drone,\" I explained. \"Come on.\"\nSmithy looked uncertain, but he followed me\ninto the narrow corridor. Machine oil and ozone\nfilled the air. Red lights ran the length of the\nceiling. We came to another heavy door. Smithy\nkept looking back the way we'd come, absently,\nnervously rubbing his jaw, as if expecting to see\nthe security drones coming for us.\nI opened a panel beside the door and pulled one\nof the fuses, then, with a small piece of wire, I\njumped the gap left from one board to another. The\nbig door unlocked noisily and swung away from us. I\ngrinned at Smithy.\n\"There's a series of reservoirs that surround\nthe Plex,\" I said. \"Each one has a different\nfunction--sewage treatment, organic recycling, water\npurification, biogasification, stuff like that.\"\n\"We get to drink some of it?\"\n\"Yes. It's a pretty self-contained system.\"\nI pocketed the fuse and pushed the heavy door\nback in place. A humid odor joined the other smells\nhere. The corridor was much larger and ran\nperpendicular to the access. A dozen meters from\nthe door was a smaller, simpler hatch. We stepped\nthrough.\nAt the bottom of a short ramp an archway opened\ninto a roofless shaft. Smithy, startled, looked up\nat the wedge of sky. Moss covered the ground all\nthe way up to the edge of a pool of dark water.\nHumus, chlorine, and methane mingled in the air.\n\"How'd you find this?\" Smithy whispered.\n\"I was listening some of the time you\nwere prattling on about how smart you are and how\nmuch you know about security systems.\" I closed my\neyes and drew a deep breath and tried to imagine for\na moment that I was outside, free. Dripping,\nsloshing water was a constant background symphony.\n\"Jees, it's...nice!\"\nI looked at Smithy. He was on his knees,\nrunning his hands over the moss. The parklands\ninside the Plex are neatly-manicured,\nwell-maintained green patches that look\nmagnificently fake. The drones have no sense of\ndisorder, no imperative to leave wild things alone.\nI treasured this spot because it was wild, untended,\nfree of the corruption of the bureaucratic mind that\nmust make everything neat and meaningless.\nOther small plants and a few saplings had taken\nroot. Off to the left was a stand of willows.\nA stack of crates had long ago been piled by the\naccess and moss covered most of them. They provided\na bench.\nSmithy suffered a coughing fit that doubled him\nover. His small body spasmed and he spat up blood.\nWhen he finally controlled it, he came over and sat\ndown beside me.\n\"This is nice,\" he said. \"I can almost stop\nthinking about sex here.\"\nI chuckled. \"You could get that taken care of, you\nknow.\"\n\"Yeah, but hell, it's the only part of the disease\nthat's worth a damn.\" He grinned. \"I had a\nhellacious libido before I got sick. Now...jees!\"\n\"You're going to fuck yourself to death, Smithy.\"\n\"Already done that. I figure maybe one o'these days\nI'll fuck myself healthy again.\" He looked at me.\n\"Y'know, I never seen you bein' sick.\"\nI continued gazing at the green moss, the water,\npaying attention to the pleasantness and ignoring\nSmithy's inquiry. After a few seconds he grunted\nand shrugged. I still wasn't convinced he didn't\nknow about my implants, but they hadn't been handed\nout indiscriminately and a lot of old timers in the\nvarious services had been passed over. As far as I\nknew, they hadn't been told, but in Smithy's case\nI'm surprised he never ferreted out the information\nanyway. In any case I decided not to talk about\nit. I didn't know how anybody would feel if I\nexplained to them that I really wasn't sick. My\nimplants counteracted the syphilis3 with which I'd\nbeen infected--just not soon enough to keep me from\nbeing thrown in the Plex. So I stayed away from\nmost people. There were some diseases even my\nimplants wouldn't take care of, diseases even the\ninsinuation that someone might have infected me with\nintentionally would have gotten them in more\ntrouble than they could deal with. This was\neffective. Eventually I may come down with one of\nthe Terminals, my implants may fail, someone may\njust kill me in a fit of insanity.\n\"Hey,\" Smithy said, tapping my shoulder.\n\"Hm?\"\nHe pointed. At the edge of the line of saplings a\ngirl was undressing. I checked myself; my first\nimpulse was to dive for cover, hide. But she didn't\nseem to notice us. After a few seconds I watched,\nrapt.\nShe was compact, muscular, short dark hair, smooth\nbrown skin. When she was nude she stepped away from\nthe trees, stopped in the middle of the clearing,\nand turned to face the water. She stood rigidly,\nunmoving.\nSuddenly she exploded into movement. She spun into\na dance, a dance of blood and hormone, a brain\ndance. Whatever music she heard its only evidence\nwas in the rhythms of her body. Her movements\nseemed effortless, as if there were no gravity. I\nsaw a choreography of neuron and synapse, a fevered\ndervish, the rondelle of RNA from deep in the oceans\nof evolution. I caught my breath; beside me Smithy\nshifted and muttered quietly.\n\"Maria Holland,\" Smithy breathed. \"I heard rumors\nshe was in here, but you don't believe it's possible\npeople like her can catch a Terminal.\"\nIt took me a second to place the name. Maria\nHolland was a ballerina who had diversified into\nfreeform, jazz, African--for a year or so she had\nbeen a common name, even for people who knew nothing\nof dance. Then she had vanished. I remembered a\nsmall flurry of reports, quickly squashed, that she\nwas in the Plex. That was three years ago.\nI frowned. She didn't look sick, either. The way\nshe moved was not the way someone three years gone\nwith a Terminal should move. I wondered if I was\nlooking at another \"embarrassment\" someone had\ngotten rid of.\nShe slammed her limbs spastically, in directions\nthat somehow conspired to make a coherent display.\nLanguage without voice, spontaneous art.\n\"Jees, she's beautiful,\" Smithy said.\nAbruptly she pirouetted, dropped to the moss, head\nbowed, and the dance ended.\nI swallowed, waiting for more. I resisted an\nimpulse to clap my hands and whistle. My eyes\nburned; it had been so long since I had last seen\ntrue beauty.\nShe snapped to her feet and looked down the length\nof the enclave, past us, her eyes wide. I followed\nher gaze and shuddered to see three white-suited BOH\ncops advancing toward her.\n\"Don't move,\" I said quietly, touching Smithy's arm,\nthen pointing at the BOH goons.\n\"Shit...\"\nThey looked like abstractions of the Perfect Knight;\nthey were no doubt armed to the teeth, ambassadors\nof health prepared to kill anything diseased.\nThey crossed in front of us and moved toward Maria\nHolland. The procedure was clear, simple, direct:\nspray to seize her muscles, then a sedative, then\nwrist restraints, and an escort back into the Plex.\nI saw each move in my mind and waited for them to\nbreak into their own dance of rules and\nrestrictions. But they went by her, almost without\ngiving her a second look. I was baffled and for a\nmoment I considered making a run for the service\ntunnel before they saw us.\nThen I saw what they were really after. They closed\nin on what I'd taken for a stand of willows. Now I\nlooked closer and saw something very different. The\nshafts were too thick and too pale yellow and the\ntexture was all wrong. They sprouted from a mass of\nthickly-veined material that was ocher and crimson.\nAs the three BOH cops drew nearer, the shafts began\nwaving frantically, within and without each other,\nswapping places with a dancelike grace.\n\"Shi...\" Smithy breathed. He snorted. \"You wanted\nto see a fucking alien, man, well there one\nfucking is.\"\n\"Shhh!\" I hissed.\nOne of the cops released his gas. A faint pearly\ncloud drifted among the spines of the novasoph.\nThey seemed to shudder, then slow their shifting.\nThe cops spread out to encircle it. They clearly\ndidn't know what they were doing; this hadn't been\nwell planned.\nSuddenly the novasoph was gone. Staring right at it\nI did not see it vanish. It simply disappeared.\nFor a second the cops looked around, confused.\nThen it reappeared. Or, rather, three of them\nappeared, one beside each cop. A collection of\nswimming spines enclosed each one, shifting and\ntwisting. The cops tried to step out of them. They\npushed aside the stalks and took steps outside, only\nto find themselves stepping right back into the\nmiddle of the tangles. For a few minutes they\ncontinued working at getting out with calm\ndeliberation. One by one, panic set it, and each of\nthem began thrashing and kicking. It didn't seem\nlike that difficult a thing to do, the thickets they\nwere in didn't look that thick, but the harder they\nfought to escape the more impossible it seemed.\nA short, gentle laugh broke the silence and I looked\nat Maria Holland again. She watched the spectacle,\narms at her sides, feet apart, with a childlike\nsmile on her face.\nWhen I looked back at the BOH cops they were gone.\nThe three sets of stalks shimmered, faded, but\ndidn't quite disappear. They didn't move...but they\nmerged back together and solidified again.\n\"Jesus, Fisher, I don't want to go mental first!\"\n\"I saw it, too, Smithy.\"\nHe laughed. \"I guess that proves you are\nsick!\"\n\"I'm--\"\n\"God, I wish I could dance like that...\"\nI glanced at Smithy. He was staring at Maria\nHolland, his mouth open slightly. She stared at the\nalien. There was something tentative, anxious in\nher attitude, as if she waited for a response.\nThe alien was still. The only sound now were the\nfaint, hollow drippings of water echoing around us.\nSuddenly its stalks spread open, like an improbable\npeacock, and I needed to go to it, step into its\narms. The urge was intense, specific, and I closed\nmy eyes for a moment. When I looked again I saw\nMaria Holland, smiling gratefully, walking toward\nthe alien.\n\"An audition...\" I said.\nSmithy glanced at me. \"Shit, I do things!\nI can dance!\"\nHe jumped from the crates.\n\"Smithy! What are you--\"\nMaria Holland stopped outside the perimeter of the\nstalks and turned. She watched Smithy scurry toward\nher, her face mildly puzzled. Smithy stopped a\nmeter away, coughed raggedly, then said something to\nher that I couldn't hear. She nodded and held out\nher hand.\nSmithy grinned at me and waved. \"See you in the\nnext life, Fisher!\"\nThey stepped together into the center of the alien\nstalks. The slender spines closed and Smithy and\nMaria Holland vanished.\nYou are welcome to come, too...\nIt wasn't exactly a voice in my head, more a\nrealization. But I also knew it had come from the\nnovasoph.\n\"To where?\" I asked.\nAway\nfrom here. Away...\n\"Why?\"\nIn answer I felt myself suffused with a deep\nsatisfaction, almost satiation, pleasure at\nsome...performance...well given. It was profoundly\nmoving. I closed my eyes and moaned. A collage of\nimages scampered through my mind--painters painting,\nsculptors sculpting, musicians playing, singers in\nsong, dancers...\nAnd all healthy.\nI shook myself and got to my feet.\n\"You're aesthetes.\" That seemed to amuse it. \"Why\nSmithy? He can't do anything.\"\nIt pleased the graceful\none. We care for our wards...\nI stared at it, my mind carefully empty. Slowly I\nshook my head.\n\"I have nothing to offer,\" I said. \"Thank you\nanyway.\"\nA few moments later the novasoph shimmered out of\nexistence.\nI made my way back into the Plex. The timing was\ntoo good. In fact, it was ridiculous, but lesser\ngains have been made from worse coincidences. The\nnovasophs arrive about the time my report hit the\nright--or the wrong--people. It was just\npossible...\nI went to the internal administration office and\nrequested an outside line. Normally, no resident\ngets an outside line. I used a code that the AI\nwarden recognized and gained access.\n\"This is Fisher,\" I said. \"I can explain how the\ndisappearances detailed in my report number AA4955\nare related directly to the novasophs.\"\nIt didn't take a day. BOH cops came in and got me\nand the next thing I knew I was on my way to\nWashington, a clean bill of health from the CDC in\nmy pocket, and traveling money from my old agency.\nFor all I knew, though, I could be back in Baltiplex\nthe next night, having failed the auditon.\nBaltiplex is, after all, the repository of\nbetrayers, of betrayed, a cathedral of betrayal.\nI have no idea how this will affect relations with\nthe novasophs. We might shut them out. We\nmight--and this thought only occurred to me after I\nwas on the transport--shut Baltiplex down and use\nthem as the way to get rid of our problem\nperformers.\nI'll miss Smithy, but I think he'd be proud of me\nfor finding a way to work this to my advantage. I\nknow how to dance, too. It's just that no one ever\ngets to see me perform. My dance is done in the\ndark, in a constant night of lies and evasions and\narrangements, away from all but a few eyes. In that\nsense, humans were very like these novasophs, if I\nunderstood them the way I thought I did. We love a\ngood performance, and the powerful can't resist a\nprivate recital.\nTHE END\nAbout the author:\nMark W.

Vaughn\nWhen\nshe flipped over a large piece of cardboard that had long ago succumbed to the\nrot and slime of their ocean climate to see a body underneath, Laera hardly\npaused. It was not the first corpse\nshe\u2019d stumbled across as the line wound its way through the narrow streets and\nalleys of the ninth ground sector, but it was definitely the freshest.\nShe could not discern any degree of decomposition.\nReaching forward to gingerly poke at her find, Laera wondered how the\nwoman had made it all the way out here. Access\nto this sector was restricted to scrub crews until it was sanitized.\n\u201cWhat\nare you doing, Laera, you\u2019re not supposed to leave the - hey, don\u2019t touch\nthat!\u201d Winn\u2019s voice called out, horrified.\nLaera\nglanced up at her friend, grinning as she always did at Winn\u2019s appearance.\nThe woman had taken their regulation uniform and turned it into an\nedifice of security against the bitter onslaught of filth and germs.\nHeavy gloves were bound with strips of cloth at both wrists, while more\nrags tied the legs of her trousers tight against her boots.\nA small white mask covered her nose and mouth.\nOnly her eyes, naked with fear of the outside world, remained uncovered.\nNo matter genetic disposition, Laera thought, this was one woman not\nsuited to her allotted line of work.\n\u201cBe\ncareful, Winn,\u201d she warned lightly, \u201cyour head might explode.\u201d\nHer\nfriend was not amused. \u201cWe should\nget back to the line,\u201d she stressed.\nLaera\nwaved a dismissive hand and bent over the body once more.\nAs she touched one shoulder in order to examine it more closely, it\nmoved. Emitting a slight groan, the\nwoman on the ground rolled to her back and lay still once more.\nDeath had not yet claimed her, after all.\nAmazed,\nLaera stared at the mountainous belly now exposed. It jutted up from her slender body like a dome.\nAs she watched, the flesh beneath the woman\u2019s clothing clenched and\nstrained as though an animal had crawled up there.\nLaera hardly noticed Winn coming forward curiously, looking up only when\nshe spoke.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s\nwrong with her?\u201d Winn asked, her gaze a mixture of fascination and disgust.\n\u201cShe\u2019s\nsick,\u201d Laera responded. \u201cSee,\nsomething has collected in her gut.\u201d\nWinn\nmoved backward immediately. \u201cWe\nbetter report this to the Managers. They\u2019ll\nstart looking for us.\u201d\nLaera\nstarted to chastise her friend for her skittishness when she realized that the\nwoman had awakened. Blue eyes\ndulled by illness and disease regarded her blandly.\nWith interest, Laera noted that the woman\u2019s moaning increased as the\nmuscles of her belly tightened once again.\n\u201cHelp\nme,\u201d she wheezed, startling Laera. \u201cThe\nbaby\u2019s coming.\u201d She whimpered\nin fear.\n\u201cDon\u2019t\nworry,\u201d Laera assured her, casting a glance behind her to be sure that the odd\nsounding creature had yet to make an appearance. \u201cI won\u2019t let it near you.\u201d\nThe\nwoman\u2019s face registered surprise, and she murmured, \u201cThen you really don\u2019t\nknow.\u201d She winced as her stomach\npained her once again.\nLaera\nsought out her friend once again. Winn\nhad not run back to the Managers as she half-expected her to have.\nAs fearful of their career track as she was, Winn was doubly scared of\nthe Manager punishments for insubordination.\nSo Laera could hardly fault the sweet mouse had she departed.\nHowever, she had suffered this discipline herself and found it not\nunbearable.\n\u201cWinn,\nI have been taken ill,\u201d she said firmly, watching the other woman shake her\nhead in the negative even before she finished.\n\u201cYou decided not to accompany me to my quarters because of the\nafternoon quota, but you saw me head in that direction.\u201d\nWinn\nlooked as though she might cry. Her\neyes were expressive enough to convey the emotion guarded by the mask covering\nher face. \u201cYou\u2019re still on\nprobation for that rationing fraud,\u201d she whispered.\n\u201cShe\u2019s\na Purist,\u201d Laera said. She\nignored Winn\u2019s cringe of fear. \u201cThere\u2019s\nno other explanation for her presence here.\nI\u2019m taking her to safety before something terrible happens.\nYou understand why I have to do this?\u201d\nNodding\nmiserably, Winn looked as though she wanted to say something, but instead turned\nand walked out of the alley to return to the line.\nLaera knew she would lie for her in her own way - somehow twisting the\ntruth to fit some other framework. Winn\u2019s\nhesitation to fabricate outright made her dissembling all the more powerful,\nbeing imbedded with some version of reality.\nThe\nwoman on the ground gazed up at her, befuddled by the pain.\nLaera knew she would be terminated had any of the Managers found her.\nThey did not have a care for the Purists\u2014who shunned the use of\nmachinery and technology. But Laera\ncould not help but feel pity for any sign of suffering.\nThe\nManagers had punished her for gathering extra labor rations for Willet and Meryn\nwhen they were sick and unable to work. Nutrients\nwere just as essential at such a time, perhaps more so than for a healthy person\nwho\u2019d performed all of his daily tasks. For\nsome reason the Managers could not understand any form of logic with empathy at\nits base.\n\u201cCan\nyou walk?\u201d Laera asked, stooping. They\nhad to move quickly, for when Winn reappeared without her a Manager would surely\ncome looking.\n\u201cI\n- I think so,\u201d the woman said.\nWith\nLaera\u2019s assistance she made it to her feet.\nIt was a short distance to the Corridor\u2014a traveling system linking the\nsectors together. Her quarters\nwould have to suffice for the moment. Laera\nplanned to have Brenna look her over. The\nhealer would be the only one other than the Overmechs who might be able to help\nthe woman.\nLaera\nwould keep the Purist\u2019s presence unknown to the Overmechs and the Managers for\nas long as she could. Hopefully she\nwould survive long enough to be able to leave on her own accord.\nA Purist would not rest easy in a world with such mechanical comforts.\n*\n* * * *\nLaera\npaused when she was close enough to the city walls to see the sentries staring\ndown at her. On either side of the\nroad were well-tended rows of greenery. They\nhad neither bright colors nor fragrant odors, and she wondered at their\nusefulness as decoration.\nThe\nstrange creature was fussing again. It\nsurely did find misery in all things. She\nopened the pouch strapped across her chest to peer inside.\nRed-faced, the creature\u2026the baby\u2026opened\nits toothless mouth to let loose a wavering scream.\nHairless,\nweak, and unable to care for itself, this baby was as useless a being as Laera\nhad ever come across. Perhaps the\nPurists collected them, since Kitiara had somehow stored it inside of herself.\nAt any rate, they would keep it or dispose of it and it would be her\ntrial no more. She couldn\u2019t even\nget it to eat the rations she\u2019d stolen before departing the compound.\nWinn\nhad sobbed when she made ready to leave. The\ndeath of the Purist had weakened her sympathies, and Laera\u2019s plan to break\ncode again by leaving the compound had nearly pushed her over.\nBut Winn was much stronger than she allowed herself to contemplate, and\nLaera had no fears for her.\n\u201cWhat\nis your business here, Kindling?\u201d a female voice asked suddenly, causing her\nto look up.\nA\nPurist female glared down at her from the wall, the sentries close at her sides.\nFrom this distance, Laera could see little of her features.\nBut the threat was clear from her tone of voice.\nReaching into the pouch, she carefully pulled out the baby and held it\naloft. Face puckering anew at the\ncoolness of the air against its skin, it began crying in earnest, waving its\narms and legs furiously.\n\u201cI\nknow nothing of this kindling,\u201d Laera announced, \u201cbut this creature is the\npossession of your Kitiara.\u201d\nThere\nwas a brief flurry of whispers, liberally laced with the sputtering of curses.\nThe woman pulled away from the edge of the wall.\nLaera tucked the baby against her body once again, for it seemed\nreassured by the proximity. It\ncould not even sit up on its own, and she had learned to line her arm against\nits back and neck so as to give it support.\nAgain, she wondered why anyone would keep such a useless creature.\nMoments\nlater, the wide doors blocking access to the city were slowly opened.\nLaera found herself facing the same Purist woman on the other side.\nStepping forward cautiously, she kept an eye on the others crowding\naround them as she approached. Their\nhostility was not something easily hidden - even the baby seemed to sense it.\nThe\nwoman was most strange, she discovered. She\nstood hunched, as if the weight of the air itself was too much for her fragile\nshoulders to bear. Her hair was\nashen, and her face lined with sagging skin. There was a faint white pallor drawn across the depths of her\neyes. It was no wonder the\nPurists lived in isolation, Laera decided.\nThey were deformed.\n\u201cGive\nhim to me,\u201d the woman demanded, thrusting her arms forward.\nLaera\nhesitated. She did not seem strong\nenough to hold the baby. What if\nshe dropped him? His weakened body\nwould surely shatter against the stone ground.\nA man pushed up against her side and poked her harshly with the butt of\nhis weapon.\n\u201cDo\nas the Mab says, Kindling,\u201d he hissed.\nShe\nwas a little shocked by his forcefulness. No\none at the compound would have dared touch another person without their express\nconsent. To cause harm for such\nlittle reason was grounds for public ostracism.\nAfraid to defy them, she held the baby out for the woman to take.\n\u201cYou\ncould not even find it in your heart to clothe him?\u201d she said, her voice\nbitter.\n\u201cHe\nwas not properly introduced to my sector,\u201d Laera answered, confused.\n\u201cHe could not wear the uniform otherwise.\u201d\nThe\nwoman frowned at her. \u201cWhere is\nKitiara?\u201d\nHanging\nher head, Laera whispered her response, fearful of another attack.\n\u201cShe did not survive the creature\u2019s emergence.\nI fear it was a very inconvenient place in which to carry him.\u201d\nTo\nher surprise, a round of snickers followed her comment.\n\u201cSend her back to her ignorant kin,\u201d someone urged.\nThe\nwoman shook her head sharply and the laughter faded. An expression of sadness had crossed her face, and Laera\nsensed that some of this was reserved for her.\n\u201cYou may feast with us if you wish,\u201d she said. \u201cFor returning Kitiara\u2019s child to us.\u201d\nLaera\nkept her face carefully composed. She\nhardly understood what the woman was talking about, but knew an invitation when\nshe heard one. The day was nearly\ndark already, and she didn\u2019t want to walk back to the compound on her own.\nThe Managers most likely already knew she\u2019d left, and she had some\nanswering to do when she got back. Maybe\nshe\u2019d spend a little time here, in an effort to steel herself for that\neventuality.\n\u201cCome,\nwalk with me,\u201d the woman urged, handing the child off to another female nearby\nand reaching forward to grab Laera\u2019s arm.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know much about the way we live, do you?\u201d\nShaking\nher head, Laera caught the glares of the others around her.\nShe was stunned at the anger directed her way.\nEven at their coldest, the Managers were never so scornful.\nThey might not always understand the needs of their workers, but Laera\nhad never felt any fear of them. She\nfollowed the woman through the crowd, cringing whenever one of them got too\nclose.\n\u201cI\u2019ll\ntake you around a bit, let you see how humans have survived without mechanical\ninvolvement. Do you know who I\nam?\u201d she asked.\nLaera\nshook her head once more, not glancing her way. She was fully engrossed in their surroundings.\nThe compound was built high, thrusting up from the ground in endless\nlevels, its sectors separated so the various classes did not intermingle.\nOnly a few of them had ever been on the ground itself\u2014the scrub crews\nwere routinely there, sterilizing the areas filled with the garbage of previous\ngenerations. But the Purist city\nhunkered low like a dozing animal, spreading out in all directions. The tallest structure stood only a few levels high.\nThey were built of stone, an inefficient method that must have required\nmuch upkeep.\n\u201cI\nam called the Mab\u2014that\u2019s my title. It\nmeans I\u2019m the leader here.\u201d\nThe\nwoman said this without any tone of arrogance in her voice, making Laera glance\nat her curiously. \u201cHow can there\nbe but one leader?\u201d she finally asked. \u201cThe\nOvermechs share responsibility of the compound\u2019s ongoing needs.\u201d\nAn\nodd expression crossed the Mab\u2019s face. \u201cYes,\nthe Overmechs,\u201d she murmured. \u201cTell\nme, do you ever see these creatures?\u201d\nLaera\nfrowned. \u201cI\u2019m but a member of\nthe scrub crew. No Overmech would\nventure down to the surface.\u201d This\nidea made her laugh.\n\u201cSo\nyou don\u2019t know what they look like?\u201d\nLaera\nshrugged. That had never been very\nimportant to any of them. The\nOvermechs simply existed, just as the Managers did.\nJust because they didn\u2019t see them didn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t there,\nwatching every proceeding. A\nthought occurred to her then, and she turned back toward the Mab to ask, \u201cYou\ndon\u2019t think they exist, do you?\u201d\n\u201cOh,\nI most definitely know they do,\u201d the woman answered. \u201cI\u2019m just wondering at your understanding of them.\nYou certainly did not fully perceive what happened to Kitiara.\u201d\n\u201cShe\nwas sick\u2026the illness took her life,\u201d Laera explained. Would they accuse her of murdering their member?\n\u201cNo,\u201d\nthe Mab drawled, pausing. \u201cShe\nwas pregnant. She had a child, and\ndied because of it. I understand\nthat you\u2019ve never seen a baby before. Tell\nme, how do you think that people come to exist?\u201d\nLaera\nshook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t\nunderstand the question.\u201d\n\u201cWhere\ndo new Kindlings come from? New\nmembers of your society.\u201d\nThere\nwas that word again. They were\ncalling members of the compound Kindlings for some reason she could not\ncomprehend. It seemed an insult of\nsorts, and she didn\u2019t like it. Her\ntone was sharp as she replied, \u201cThey are introduced to their proper sector.\u201d\n\u201cBut\nas adults.\u201d At her blank look,\nthe Mab continued. \u201cWhere were\nthey before they were fully grown - when they looked like Kitiara\u2019s baby, and\nnot big like you?\u201d\nFinally\nLaera was beginning to understand what the woman was asking her.\nThe Mab seemed to believe that the tiny creature she\u2019d carried back to\nthe city was somehow the same as she was, and Kitiara.\nIt made her sad, the superstition that plagued the Purists.\nShe sighed and shook her head, mournful that they\u2019d allow themselves to\nlive so deeply within their own mythology.\n\u201cIt\nis as we worried it might be,\u201d the Mab said.\n\u201cThe machines are so fearful that you might take back your autonomy\nthat they\u2019ve deleted all knowledge of what it is to be human.\nCome, I have more to show you.\u201d\nSeveral\nhours later, with night fully fallen and the feast fires burning brightly, Laera\nstood alone and watched the Purists in their revelry.\nThey had donned their most colorful clothing to dance and sing around a\nraging bonfire. Food and wine\nflowed freely, staining the earth and bystanders as the more careless attempted\nto combine the two activities, flinging the matter in all directions with waving\nlimbs. It was confusing, that they\ncelebrated the death of one of their own, but no more confusing than everything\nelse she\u2019d seen on that day.\nThe\nMab showed her members of their city in all forms of deformity.\nThe baby was only one level of abnormality. There were Purists in all sizes - as tiny as the baby and all\nthe way up to normal. The Mab had\ncalled them children, and explained that they were in the stages of growth that\nall humans must go through before reaching adulthood. Humans aged\u2026they grew old like the Mab, and finally died of\nthis peculiar state.\nBut\nLaera found it hard to believe such a superstitious fable.\nHow was it that all humans did this when she had never seen such a child\nin the compound? New introductions\nall looked much like the rest of them did\u2014adults, Mab called them.\nMind spinning, Laera retreated while the feasting commenced, deciding\nthat silence was what she needed then.\nShe\nwas still pondering this new information when someone came up behind her and\ngrabbed her around the waist. \u201cHey\nnow, little Kindling, why aren\u2019t you dancing with the others?\u201d\nPulling\naway, she turned to see a group of males staring back at her.\nThey were of the smaller version, and beardless.\nThis meant they were younger than full-grown, she recalled.\nStill, many of them stood taller than she did, and she felt a small stir\nof fear.\n\u201cDon\u2019t\nthink the Mab is going to let you stay here with us,\u201d one of them said, and\nshe recognized his voice from earlier. \u201cYou\ndon\u2019t even have a brain in your head\u2014you\u2019re just a bit of tinder stored\nfor the \u2018Great Society.\u2019\u201d\nLaera\nscowled. \u201cWhy would I want to\nstay here?\u201d she asked defiantly. \u201cAnd\nbe stricken with your abnormalities?\u201d\nWhat\nshe thought was a grave insult only seemed to amuse them.\nThey laughed at her statement, and their central figure stepped closer to\nher. She leaned back immediately,\nmaking him grin once again.\n\u201cShe\ndidn\u2019t even tell you the whole story,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause she thought you wouldn\u2019t want to go back there.\nBut who wants to spare the feelings of Kindling?\nYou\u2019re just a mule, did you know that?\nThe machines use you to run their compound.\nAnd when you get too old to work, they\u2019ll kill you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re\nlying,\u201d Laera hissed. \u201cThe\nOvermechs would never allow anyone to be harmed like that -\u201c\nHe\ninterrupted her. \u201cStupid!\u201d he\nshouted directly in her face. \u201cYou\u2019re\nso stupid! The Overmechs are\nthe machines! They created you. You weren\u2019t even born like a normal person.\u201d\nBirth\nwas something else the Mab had tried explaining. Kitiara had not simply been storing the baby inside of her.\nHer body had somehow formed it. When\nthe proper time arose, the body expelled the child.\nThis was supposed to be natural as well.\nIt sounded archaic and dangerous to Laera.\nBut\nwhat they said about the Overmechs was not true. They ran the compound. They\nwere people with the correct genetic disposition to maintain levels of\nleadership among their society. This\nwas taught to all workers from the day of introduction.\nA small spasm of nausea burst through her middle, and she backed away\nfrom him.\n\u201cI\ndon\u2019t believe you,\u201d she finally said, her voice weak. But somewhere deep in her mind she wondered if he wasn\u2019t\ntelling her the truth. She thought\nof all the times she had pondered the cold aloofness presented by the Overmechs\nwhen they were faced with such small matters as illness and exhaustion.\nStill,\nshe wasn\u2019t about to give this creature the benefit of her questions.\nWhen he started forward to chide her again, she turned and ran, having to\npush her way through the small cluster of Purists gathered around.\nLaera caught the gaze of the Mab as she went.\nThe sympathetic woman looked as though she wanted to stop her, but Laera\ndidn\u2019t pause as she burst through the center of the city and toward the main\ndoors.\nAs\nshe approached, she felt her hysteria welling.\nThe doors were closed, trapping her inside. Laera started screaming at the men there to open them, to let\nher out. They stared at her in\nshocked disbelief before finally turning to do as she asked. When she raced past the plants growing outside, recognizing\nthem now as crops grown for sustenance, Laera wondered faintly how their rations\nhad come into being. No one ever\nsaw them created, only were there when they were distributed. It made her wonder what else about the compound they\nweren\u2019t allowed to see.\nFor\nthe first time, she dreaded the punishment she was sure to receive upon\nreturning home. If the Managers\ndiscovered that she had visited a Purist city, perhaps they might eliminate her\nas the creatures had taunted. The\nMab declared that the machines didn\u2019t want them to know about their origins.\nShe would hold the secret deep inside, imagining the reaction she\u2019d\nreceive from Winn if she told her what she\u2019d learned.\nIn\nthe end, what did the Purists know, anyway?\nThe spread of fear and paranoia was most likely what kept their members\namong their ranks. For who\notherwise would want to live in such a place, where death came so heavily and\ncruelty was conceived as completely commonplace?\nThe more she considered it, the easier it was for Laera to return to the\nonly home she\u2019d known. There was\na security at the compound, a common bond that kept her close.\nHer\nfootsteps slowed as her worry released her.\nWalking evenly now, Laera decided that the fools had merely been playing\nwith her. They had discovered an\neasy explanation for their own deformities.\nThinking on it further, she even laughed. Soon she\u2019d return to the careful sanity of the compound,\nand forget this visit entirely. She\nand Winn would find ways around their quota, steal rations from the Managers,\nand all would be well again.\nEND","source":null,"source-hostname":null,"excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/O5Su4-jKkt4QmSrx60W7rXr7dy0.json"}

I leaned\nover the side of the bed and hacked several times,\nforcing the vile fluid out of my lungs.\nHaven\u2019t killed me yet,\nI thought, silently cursing the\ndisease that ate away at me, leaving me a husk.\nJust might make it. I waited for a minute to be\nsure the attack was finished, then lifted myself out\nof bed, using the table beside me for support. I\nclosed my eyes again, and took a deep breath,\nholding the air in for as long as I could. Just\na few more hours. I wondered if I would last\neven that long.\n* * *\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the success rate again?\u201d I\nasked, knowing that I had already asked this same\nquestion, five minutes ago. I wasn\u2019t sure if I had\nreally forgotten, or was just stalling for time.\n\u201cAbout forty-five percent, for men\nyour age,\u201d he said. This doctor was young, but he\nlooked at me with eyes much older. He must have\nseen this old face on dozens of people, awash with\nthe strange mix of emotions that impending death\nalways brings. Regret; fear in tremendous amounts,\nand just enough hope to stay alive for another day.\nI closed my eyes. Forty-five\npercent, I thought. Gambling odds. I\nopened my eyes. \u201cAlright, I\u2019m ready.\u201d I\u2019ll take\nit. The doctor, whose name I hadn\u2019t even tried\nto remember, stood. He offered his hand, to help me\nup, but I refused. I saw his eyes widen\nfractionally, a sliver of something showing, whether\nit was respect for an elderly man\u2019s dignity or\nannoyance with a stubborn old man, I didn\u2019t know. I\ngot to my feet without assistance, and followed him\nto the door. The briefing room was small and drab.\nI had seen this room before, although this was the\nfirst time I had been in this building. I had seen\ndozens of such rooms, designed for breaking bad news\nor for reassuring people that danger is far off. It\nwas in a room just like this one, that the news had\nbeen given to me. Six months ago, I\nthought. Six months to age\nforty years and become acquainted with death.\nI trudged down the corridor of the\nclinic, anonymous doors passing on either side, as I\nonce again thought about what brought me here.\nCouldn\u2019t be lack of faith. No, I have faith.\nThen why? Maybe it was curiosity; the desire\nto know what I would have done with a normal\nlifespan, in a healthy body. Bitter over the loss\nof the life I wouldn\u2019t have the time or strength to\nlive, I had turned to The Clinic. The controversy\nbothered me, as I read reams of newspaper articles\nand scientific magazines, considering. The\nprotesters outside were distracting. Their chants\nwere silent now, as the building was thoroughly\nsound-proofed, but they still sounded in my mind.\nThe signs and banners were fresh in my memory, we\nhad to wade through them to reach the door. \u201cThe\nClinic cannot save your Soul\u201d was a popular one,\nalong with \u201cGod punishes those who tamper with His\ndesign\u201d. Some heartless bastard with a sense of\nhumor played \u201cDon\u2019t Fear the Reaper\u201d over a\nloudspeaker, and a preacher with a southern accent\nscreamed threats at the faceless police barricade,\npromising \u201cEternal Hellfire\u201d as he called it (the\ncapitals were present in his voice) for all who\nentered the building. It bothered me, but I opened\nthe door anyway. As I stepped through it, I had\nrealized that it may be the last time I saw the sky\nwith my own eyes. I had turned, looked up at the\nbleak, overcast atmosphere. Rain threatened. With\na little luck, it\u2019ll short out that damn\nloudspeaker, I thought.\n* * *\nSlowly, I lay down on the cold, metal\nsurface, my back chilled from the cold. The\nsteel instruments gleamed at me, the overhead lights\nof the operating room made me close my eyes again.\nI rested my head on a sterile pillow, and allowed\nmyself to feel the fear that I had been holding at\nbay for so long. The automated surgeon hovered\nseveral feet above my head, like a gigantic spider,\npoised over a victim. I ignored the vicious looking\ninstruments at the end of its long, tentacle-like\narms. The anesthesiologist sank a needle into my\narm. I barely noticed, as pain had become as much a\npart of my life as breathing. I took a deep breath,\nand went over what I knew in my mind.\nNew procedure. Direct connection\nbetween the brain and the machine. Induced sensory\ninput, simulated reality.\nLife after death.\nI imagined a row of brains, floating\nin rows of tanks. Neat columns of computers\nproviding sensory substitution. A whole new\nworld. Cheesy slogans and eternal \u201clife\u201d. Live the\nlife you dreamed of when you were young. I\nreturned to facts, forcing the unpleasant images out\nof my mind. Live out an extended lifespan in a\ndigitized utopia. Conquer death, as medicine never\ncould. I couldn\u2019t help it, I kept returning to\nthe dreamy, rhythmic advertisements. The arguments\nbetween the world\u2019s greatest philosophers, arguing\nover the synthetic reality offered by The Clinic,\nplayed out in my mind.\n\u201cThe real question is: does reality\nhave value in itself? Does it matter if the life\nyou experience isn\u2019t actually happening, that it\u2019s\nmerely an illusion?\u201d These voices played back in my\nmemory, the soundtrack to my tormented misery as my\nbody died but my mind (Soul?) remained. \u201cThis is\nPandora\u2019s box! Don\u2019t you see? Within a century,\nthis will be the norm! Perfectly healthy people\nwill let those Doctor Frankensteins slice them up,\njust so they won\u2019t have to live with reality. We\ncannot let this happen; this threatens the soul of\nHumanity!\u201d\nA dream you never have to wake up\nfrom.\nI could feel the chemicals begin to\nslow down my thoughts, my mind began to wade through\nthem, my skull slowly filled with molasses. I\nfought it off for a few moments, wanting to savor\nthe last thoughts I would have in this reality. Dream\nor nightmare?\nLive as long as they can keep the\nbrain alive. Centuries, maybe. They wipe your\nmemory. Soyou won\u2019t remember. Be. Youngagain\u2026\nWhat was I saying? No. I\nremember. I remember\u2026 Sunshine. .\nIrememberremeber. So\ntired. Iwondr I woner if I willnoti\nnotic the\nknow the difference?\n* * *\nAwake.\nI braced myself for...\nSomething... What was it? Strange. For some\nreason I expected pain. I took a deep breath, and\nlet it out slowly. Finally I opened my eyes, and\npaused. Strange... A dream hovered at the edge of\nperception, but... No, it was gone. The\ndream had faded, as they often do.\nMy wife stirred, she breathed a deep\nbreath, started to lift her head, left it on my\nshoulder. I turned my head to study her. So\nbeautiful. Brown hair, the color of chocolate.\nEyes; my wife has the most incredible eyes. Eyes\nthat own you, you never want to look away.\nI waited a long moment, and decided\nthat she was still asleep. I got out of bed slowly,\nget up too fast and my arthritis... No, wait. What\nam I thinking about? Get up slowly as not to wake\nher. Why did I expect by back to ache? I\u2019m much\ntoo young for that. I padded softly to a bay\nwindow, overlooking a great expanse of water. I\nleaned back, put my arms over my head and\nstretched. Got to fix the boat today, I\nthought. The sail had been damaged in a storm two\nnights ago. Maybe take it out today. The\nsun peeked over the horizon, turning the water into\nliquid gold. I smiled, and narrowed my eyes against\nthe glare.\nI turned in response to a noise\nbehind me. Our daughter, barely six years old, was\nrubbing her eyes, clutching her bear. She looks\njust like her mother. I walked over and picked\nher up.\n\u201cGoodmornin daddy,\u201d she slurred, the\nlast of the sleep leaving her voice.\n\u201cMorning pumpkin,\u201d I said. \u201cDid you\nsleep okay?\u201d\n* * *\nI lay down slowly on the cold surface\nof the boat, my back instantly chills. I pause, and\nfurrow my brow. Strange. This seems familiar. I\nlook at my right arm, and for some reason am\nsurprised at the absence of a needle there.\nDidn\u2019t\u2026 Didn\u2019t I\u2026?\nI shake off the feeling of d\u00e9j\u0155 vu,\nand set about examining the damaged sail. A cloud\npasses overhead, the only one in the sky. The sun\nis already warming the surface of the boat,\nrelieving the goose bumps which had risen on my\nstomach. I take a breath, and smile at the\nbrightening sky.

Snider \u00a9 2000\nEditor's Note: This is the\nfirst science fiction story I ever finished.\nIt's not perfect by any stretch, and someday I\nmight change the ridiculous, unpronounceable\ntitle. I included it in the first issue of\nscifidimensions for my own\npersonal satisfaction - and because there was\nnothing else to post! Enjoy!\nToward\nthe end, Polidorus was too ashamed to wear his medals from the Dervish War.\nPol\nhad been a young trooper during the early days on Enti\u2019ilu.\nAt first, the native Enti\u2019ilusians (dubbed \u201cwhirling dervishes\u201d\nbecause of their spinning, four-legged method of perambulation) had fought like\nbanshees, throwing themselves by the thousands, recklessly, against humans\nentrenched with cutting beams and bugzappers.\nThe\nwar on Enti\u2019ilu had lasted less than a standard year.\nThe humans had arrived and taken over despite fierce resistance; then,\nmysteriously, the dervishes had stopped fighting.\nIt was never really a war, truth be told; the primitive, agrarian\nEnti\u2019ilusians were no match for land-hungry humans armed with the latest in\nultratech weaponry.\nIgnoring\nprotests from Earth and the other First Colonies, large settling parties had\nbeen organized, eagerly abandoning their cold, arid worlds for the slow rivers,\nfertile deltas, and thick oxygen of Enti\u2019ilu.\nThe objecting governments were in no position - economically,\npolitically, or strategically - to oppose the invasion and settlement.\nAnd as far as anyone could tell, no one who had set foot on this rich,\nnew world had objected to the land rush; nor had they raised a voice against the\nexpulsion of the intelligent insect-like aborigines.\nThe humans had stolen everything, even hijacking the native designation\nfor the planet.\nNearly\n20 years later, Pol still had nightmares, seeing the man-sized arthropods\nclosing down on him, their lower torsos rotating on four shining insect legs;\nseeing them explode with a pop and hiss when their exoskeletons could no longer\ncontain the fluids vaporizing inside. Late\nat night, Pol and his comrades had watched as the dervishes set aside their\nweapons, risking death out in the open, gathering their fallen warriors, placing\nthem on great funeral pyres. But\nhis most unsettling memory was of a night on patrol, in the low hills\nsurrounding their encampment. He\nhad failed to detect the dervish snare until it was too late.\nWith a scream of agony, he had collapsed to the ground, his right shin\ncrushed by the booby trap. His\ncutter had flown from his hand, and before he could locate it, the dervishes had\nappeared. Even in the black,\nmoonless night they were iridescent, their salmon-pink carapaces glistening,\ntheir deep blue vision-plates reflecting the stars overhead.\nThey quickly surrounded him, but not in a threatening manner, their\ncranial segments bobbing up and down slowly, inspecting him closely.\nThen one of them had reached forth, like someone approaching a strange\nanimal. With its four\nmutually-opposing digits, it had briefly grasped the bare skin of his upper arm,\nfeeling his pulse and warmth. Then it withdrew its hand, conferring briefly with its\ncounterparts in their clicking, whispering language \u2013 and just as suddenly as\nthey had appeared, they had reeled out of sight, taking his weapon with them.\nHe\u2019d spent three hours hobbling downhill in the darkness until the\npatrol found him.\nThe\nday after this incident the dervishes stopped attacking.\nNo one actually made a connection between Pol\u2019s encounter and the end\nof the \u201cwar\u201d - except Pol, of course. He\u2019d\nalways wondered why they\u2019d spared him. Why\nlet him live, when his people were little by little taking over native farmland,\nlittle by little forcing them into the purple hills?\nAfter that, only occasionally, a band of three or four aliens would be\nspotted, always one carrying the body of a dead dervish, the others bearing\nbundles of native pink wood, which they used to build a funeral pyre, committing\ntheir deceased comrade to the rich soil. Once in a while, an intolerant settler would take potshots at\na funeral party. The dervishes\nwould scatter for cover, leaving the bodies until the next day, when more\ndervishes would arrive to help finish the work.\nEventually the authorities stopped settler interference with the\nfunerals, at the same time keeping a wary eye on the dervishes when they\nappeared. Month by month, year by\nyear, the funeral parties became rarer, and smaller, until finally only single\ndervishes would be sighted, spinning slowly, bearing a body, which they would\nleave in the fields, making several return trips to gather enough pink wood for\na proper fire. By that time, the\ndervishes had become a tourist attraction, thousands traveling to the farm\ncountry in hopes of spotting a poll-bearer. The\npolice would always ensure that it was unmolested until its job was done; and\nthe farmers would ensure that the remaining ashes were worked into the earth on\nthe next run of the plow.\nThe\nfew xenobiologists who took a serious interest in the dervishes were sorely\ndisappointed in the amount of data they could gather.\nSeeing a dervish in the wild was almost as rare as seeing a bigfoot, and\nonly a scant handful of bodies had been recovered.\nVery little was known of their language and customs; absolutely nothing\nwas known about their reproductive habits.\nSeveral\nyears after the war, the end had come for the dervishes.\nThere had been no sightings in three or four years.\nTheir strange, pink crops had given way to the green of human crops \u2013\ngrains and vegetables and other useful plants.\nThen one day, some children were out playing in the fields, and they\nspotted it. A solitary dervish\npicked its way carefully out of the tree-covered hills.\nThe children, frightened, ran to their respective homes, and soon the\nwhole village was roused, gathering to watch from a safe distance. Pol was the Town Speaker by then. Upon arriving at the scene he consulted with a pair of cops,\nwho were sitting on the hood of their flicker.\nOne of them he instructed to call the university to get a xeno quick, the\nother he asked to accompany him.\nThe\ndervish had made its third trip from the forest, where it had apparently been\nhording dry wood. Much of the pyre\nwas comprised of wood from invading species, trees the humans had brought with\nthem. Mixed in, here and there, was native pink wood.\nEither the type of wood made no difference to the dervish, or it had\nlittle choice in what it collected.\nThe\ntwo men came within eight or nine meters of the dervish.\n\u201cStay here,\u201d Pol told the officer, and approached the dervish slowly.\nIt stopped rummaging in the pyre, its cranial segment swiveling in his\ndirection. The blue vision-plate\nshined brightly in the sun, reflecting white clouds and green crops.\nIt remained absolutely motionless as Pol came within three or four\nmeters. He could see his image in\nthe visor, hair blowing in the breeze; arms in the air, showing he was unarmed.\n\u201cHello,\u201d\nhe said, feeling a bit foolish, but trying not to show it. \u201cCan you understand me?\u201d\nThe dervish appraised him, still motionless, saying nothing.\n\u201cCan\nI help you? Is there something we\ncan do?\u201d As the warm afternoon\nair buffeted his clothes, he was suddenly filled with deep remorse.\nHow many of this creature\u2019s kind had he killed, dicing them with a\ncutter, or boiling them inside-out with a zapper?\nThey had taken their land, pushed them out, with no attempt at\ncoexistence. The xenos \u2013 the only ones with any serious interest in the\nindigenous species - had arrived\ntoo little, too late. There was\nnothing left to study when they got there.\nThe native Enti\u2019ilusians, scorned as primitive bugs, had become folk\ntales, laughing stocks. How many\njokes had Pol heard, or told, about \u201cthe Illusions\u201d?\nThe planet was dotted with high school sports teams called the Whirling\nDervishes, or the Anti-Illusions. On\nweekends, out on a flicker ride, he could see weather vanes on farm buildings,\ncut out in the silhouette of a dervish; four legs and two arms, one hand\noutstretched to point with the wind. How\nmany flicker helmets had he seen, metallic pink, with a blue reflective visor?\nHe looked at the ground, sick with regret.\nThey had taken everything away from this species without learning a thing\nfrom them.\nHe\nlooked back up. The dervish raised\none arm, slowly, the four-fingered hand pointing at him.\n\u201cYou have changed,\u201d it hissed, in heavily distorted Standard\nEnglish. Pol was astonished.\nHis mouth fell open, hands dropping to his sides.\nBefore\nhe could reply, the dervish carefully removed something from the small woven\npouch it was carrying. It climbed, with surprising agility, to the top of the pyre,\nand laid down. It reached beneath\nitself with one arm; the hand fiddled briefly, and a fire sprang into existence.\nPol was aghast, briefly considering saving the creature, but he relented,\nbacking away slowly as the fire quickly engulfed the mangle of gray and brown\nand pink wood. The dervish\ncarefully folded itself, like a pocket knife, as the flames licked against its\ngleaming exoskeleton. Pol was\nvaguely aware of the shouts and shrieks and moans of the gathered townsfolk.\nHe felt as if he would faint, but by then he had reached the police\nflicker, steadying himself on it.\nThe\npolice busied themselves, herding the crowd back, encouraging them to disperse. Children\ncried. Parents consoled them,\nlooking both alarmed and angry that this creature had immolated itself before\ntheir very eyes. The xenos arrived,\nlate as usual, and there was a terrible argument as Pol tried to explain to them\nwhat had happened, why he had spoiled their last chance (perhaps) at capturing\none alive. Finally Pol lost his\ntemper, shouting a stream of expletives at one of the scientists as the cops\nheld him back. The other xenos ran\ntoward the burning pyre, which had reached its apex, and raised their arms in\ndisgust. Nothing to salvage.\nThe\nnext day Pol called the xenos to apologize; also to give them as much detail as\nhe could recall about the creature\u2019s behavior.\nHe neglected to tell them what the dervish had said.\nWhy had it spoken to him? What\ndid it mean? Surely this could not\nbe one of the group that had snared him years ago!\nThere seemed to be no other explanation.\nDespite being the object of its reproach, he took secret pleasure knowing\nthat he was the only human who had ever communicated with this beautiful,\ngraceful, and now - most likely - extinct species.\nYou\nhave changed.\n\u201cI\nhave changed,\u201d he thought.\nOnce, he had been a young, ignorant grunt, perfectly happy to do his job\nfor three squares a day, a pension, and a land grant from the conquered\nterritories. So what if that job\nmeant the dispossession of another sentient species?\nBut, bit by bit, over time \u2013 too late perhaps \u2013 he had drifted,\nmorphed, into a man with enough thoughtfulness to look back with regret.\nThe\nyears passed. No more dervishes\nwere spotted. The general consensus\nwas that the native Enti\u2019ilusians were truly extinct.\nThe scientists timidly picked at the few frozen partial corpses in their\npossession, treating them like holy relics, doling out tissue samples by the\nfractional gram to various experts for analysis.\nThen\nthe Sickness came. In less than two\nweeks, virtually the entire population was seized with fever, nausea, tremors,\nparalysis, and finally - coma. Mercifully,\nand miraculously, there had been no deaths \u2013 but no recoveries either.\nAs Town Speaker, Pol worked around the clock with panicked officials,\ntrying to organize doctors and police in an effort to contain the plague and\nidentify its cause. But before they\ncould make any progress, they too were taken ill. Pol was barely able to drag himself into bed, next to his\ncomatose wife; they had been forced to stay home due to the hospital crowding.\nIn his delirium, he laughed bitterly, smitten by the irony that, like H.\nG. Wells\u2019 Martians, they too had won the war, but lost the peace to an unknown\nand unknowable opponent. He lost\nconsciousness.\n#\nHe\nawoke. It was night.\nHow much time had elapsed, he could not tell.\nOddly, he remembered something his mind had dredged up during periods of\nhalf-remembered consciousness. Or\nperhaps a strange dream. Not the\nnightmares of years past, but a new dream \u2013 almost like a revelation. The scientists had been stumped by the lack of identifiable\ndervish genitalia, or any other clue as to their methods of procreation.\nBut Pol remembered watching an ancient documentary, made centuries ago on\nEarth before the Diaspora. Primitive\nhumans, living on remote islands, had practiced a form of ancestor worship.\nThey had taken the bodies of their deceased loved ones, and after\nreducing them to ashes in a great funeral pyre, had mixed the ashes with\nsomething or other, then drank it down, thinking that this brought them together\nwith the spirits of the dead. He\ncouldn\u2019t remember all the details, but it was something like that.\nThen his mind connected the dots. The\ndervishes always cremated their\ndead, and always in the lowlands near the rivers.\nWhy?\nPerhaps because the crops they raised absorbed the essence of the\ndead. Reproduction by\nabsorption? By osmosis?\nEach dead individual mixing into the soil, rejuvenating those who\nremained? And perhaps, from\nsome of the remains, their young grew out of the ground like plants, emerging\nperiodically, en masse, like the locusts of old Earth!\nHis\nmind returned to the other great puzzle. Why\nhad the aliens stopped fighting, all those years ago?\nThey had fought like cornered animals, then, without explanation, they\nhad simply retreated to the hills. Abandoned\ntheir fields, the source of their rejuvenation.\nAbandoned their young, lying unborn deep beneath the soil. Why?\nWith a shock the answer came to him.\nWe\nare compatible!\nPol\nfelt weak, but better. In the dark,\nfeeling strange, he arose from bed and staggered to the bathroom, knocking over\na small end table, scraping items off the dresser.\nHe turned the light on, and looked in the mirror.\nA deep blue visor gleamed back at him; a four-fingered hand steadied him\nagainst the basin.\nHe\nreeled out into the street to join the celebration.\nHis wife still slept in bed, folded like a pocket knife.\nEND\nBack to\nOriginal Fiction","source":null,"source-hostname":null,"excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/mIt7H5UaIJDBgsuWJWWPiWitBuk.json"}

Snider \u00a9 2000\nEditor's Note: I wrote this\nas a submission for a time-travel short story\ncontest. In my attempt to create an\n\"air-tight\" plot that retained consistency in\nthe face of the inevitable time-travel\nparadoxes, I neglected good storytelling and\ncharacterization. Nonetheless, I've\nincluded it here for your enjoyment.\nJohn\nJames Ingersoll was a model criminal and a model inmate.\nA model criminal in that he had cleverly eluded the police for 13 years\nuntil his unexpected capture in 1998. A\nmodel inmate in that he had actually improved himself, spending the subsequent\n23 years in a federal penitentiary, performing volunteer work, staying out of\ntrouble, earning degrees in engineering and law, and obtaining special\nprivileges by participating in the highly secretive Omnichron Project.\nThe\ncircumstances of Ingersoll\u2019s capture were shrouded in mystery.\nThe fact that the Feds had captured him, not the state police, led many\nto speculate that Ingersoll had been (or had run afoul of) a government agent\ninvolved in some sort of cloak-and-dagger project.\nAt any rate, deals were made; publicity suppressed - the end result being\nthat Ingersoll was sent to a maximum security federal facility, which afforded\ncertain luxuries not readily available to the average lifer, in exchange for his\ntotal cooperation - in Omnichron.\nTwo\nhundred seventeen technicians, engineers, bureaucrats and observers (not\nincluding the infamous Mr. Ingersoll) had gathered in the Omnichron facility, 12\nstories beneath the Western desert. The\ntechnicians and engineers knew why they were there, but not where.\nTheir drivers, who had delivered them in vans with windowless passenger\ncompartments, knew where they were, but not why.\nThe bureaucrats and observers pretended to know both, but none knew if\nthe others knew, or how much, or why. And\nwhat Mr. Ingersoll knew, or thought, or why, was anybody\u2019s guess.\nThe\nculmination of the project was the Omnichron Matrix.\nThe function of this massive machine was, quite simply, to move objects\nback and forth through time.\nIngersoll\nwas escorted into the lab. At\nfifty-something, he was impressively fit and neatly dressed.\nClean-cut and polite, it was hard to believe that he was the same\nunwashed, overweight heathen a jury had convicted 23 years ago.\nHis only questionable physical feature was an angry scar which ran across\nhis forehead, just below the hairline.\nThe\ntechnicians had prepped him for his excursion.\nA number of nanoprobes had been implanted in his body.\nOver the last few weeks, he had been periodically injected with a special\nsolution which would allow the Matrix to lock onto him.\nHe was dressed in 1998 period clothing: brand-name blue jeans with\nmatching jacket, white leather tennis shoes, flannel shirt, and a baseball cap.\nDoctor\nMary Bennett Doyle, Principal Engineer and Assistant Director of the Project,\nthoroughly hated Ingersoll. First, Ingersoll had been shoved down her throat as Test\nSubject One at the last minute, on the personal authority of her boss, Project\nDirector Thomas Skarbek. Second,\nshe objected vehemently to a career criminal being offered the historic\nopportunity to become the first human being to travel backward in time.\nShe was perfectly happy to let Ingersoll travel forward in time, at the\nsame pace as everyone else, until the gods saw fit to remove him from existence.\nAnd she didn\u2019t give a flying goddamn (and had said as much) if he\u2019d\nbecome the Pope since his capture; she didn\u2019t trust him any further than she\ncould kick him.\nBut\nDoctor Doyle knew that today\u2019s test would proceed, with or without her, so she\nswallowed her pride and played along, albeit reluctantly, not willing to be\nabsent during the greatest technological achievement in human history.\nAs\ntechnicians fussed around Ingersoll, making final checks of his implants, the\ndoctor reviewed the mission objective with him.\n\u201cWhen\nthe transfer occurs, you should materialize upright and on the ground \u2013 but be prepared in\ncase you take a tumble. You\u2019ll be\nin a warehouse in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1998.\nYou should have memorized the floor plan. Find the safe we talked about.\nOpen it \u2013 you do remember the\ncombination?\u201d\nIngersoll,\nquite professional, recited the numbers drolly, ignoring her obvious animosity.\n\u201c\u2026And I will retrieve the\npair of sensitive temporal tags, and keep them on me until I am automatically\nretrieved by the Matrix four hours later \u2013 my time.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\nright,\u201d Doyle replied dryly. \u201cThe\nexcursion will be instantaneous from our\nviewpoint. As we discussed, once you\u2019ve secured the tags, you have\nplenty of time. Just relax, and for\nGod\u2019s sake don\u2019t go outside. The\nbuilding is secure, so you shouldn\u2019t run into anyone - but if you do, say as\nlittle as possible. At least get\nout of sight so they don\u2019t see the transfer take place.\nThe last thing we need is some freaked-out citizen stirring up trouble.\nWe\u2019ve checked police records and the local papers for that time period\nand it doesn\u2019t look like you will be \u2013 uh, were - spotted.\nJust don\u2019t take any chances.\n\u201cOne\nmore thing. No matter what happens,\ndon\u2019t part with that hat. It\u2019s\nloaded with nanotech sensors that will make an audiovisual record of your\nexcursion. And the button on top\ncontains the miniaturized transfer scanner. Once it\u2019s activated by the Matrix, it\u2019ll scan you, and\nbring you back in one piece.\u201d\n\u201cYou\nhope,\u201d finished Ingersoll, winking\nat her. She made a disgusted sound\nthrough her teeth and turned away. Ingersoll\nlaughed.\nProject\nDirector Skarbek stepped forward. Skarbek\nhad been with the Project for nearly 35 years, longer than anyone else.\n\u201cOne last thing, Mr. Ingersoll. I\nfeel I must remind you, per your agreement with the federal government, that if\nfor some reason you are not retrieved, and find yourself stranded in 1998, you\nare to say nothing to anyone, and contact me immediately at the phone number you\nhave memorized. We\u2019ve given you\n$200 and a counterfeit driver\u2019s license, in case we can\u2019t get to you right\naway. If you try to evade us, our\nsecurity agents \u2013 when they find you\n- are authorized to eliminate any threat to the secrecy of the Project.\u201d\nIngersoll\nnodded, making a dismissive gesture with one hand.\n\u201cLet\u2019s get this over with.\u201d\nTechnicians\nhelped Ingersoll into a spherical chamber just big enough to allow him to stand\nupright. The dignitaries donned\nprotective eyewear and huddled around small view ports to observe the procedure.\n#\nIt\nwas over so fast they could barely believe anything had happened.\nAt a signal from Doctor Doyle, a technician activated the Matrix.\nThere was a flash of light, so brief it was almost imperceptible to the\nhuman eye. Ingersoll\u2019s position\nchanged, as if he were a film clip with a bad splice.\nHe\nput a hand against a plexiglass view port to steady himself, smearing a bloody\npalm print across its surface.\n\u201cOh\nmy God!\u201d gasped Doyle. \u201cGet him\nout of there!\u201d\nAs\nmedics extracted Ingersoll, who was obviously reeling with nausea, Doyle turned\nangrily to Skarbek. \u201cDamn you!\nThis bastard has done it again \u2013 and you let him!\u201d\nSkarbek\nignored her, wading into the confusion, shouting commands. \u201cI want those tags\nauthenticated!\u201d he ordered a\ntechnician. To the medics:\n\u201cGet him out of here! Sedate\nhim! And run a sample of that blood\n\u2013 I think you\u2019ll find it\u2019s his own.\u201d\nA\nmedic glanced skeptically at Skarbek. \u201cNo\nwounds on him \u2013 not even a scratch.\u201d\nThe\ntechnician called from a test station. \u201cThe\ntags are authentic, sir.\u201d\nDoyle\nwas absolutely livid. Skarbek\nbriefly considered having her sedated as well.\n\u201cPlease, Mary - calm down. It\u2019s\nnot what you think!\u201d\n\u201cNot\nwhat I think!\u201d shouted Doyle. \u201cYou send that maniac on a mission like this, and you\nexpect him to do as he\u2019s told? He\u2019s\nprobably been waiting 23 years for his big chance to have another thrill!\nJesus\u2026\u201d she trailed off, hugging herself.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d\nSkarbek was now speaking louder, addressing the shocked group of observers.\n\u201cI assure you there\u2019s a good explanation for all of this. If you\u2019ll just move into the screening room, we\u2019ll take a\nlook at his recording.\u201d Skarbek\nheld the baseball cap aloft with both hands, then handed it to a technician.\n#\nHad\nit not been for its historical significance, the video would have been so boring\nas to be unwatchable. The view of the Omnichron chamber\u2019s interior blinked\ninstantly into the interior of a dim warehouse.\nThe image weaved, as Ingersoll fought off the initial disorientation and\nwaited for his eyes to adjust to the dark.\nHe looked at his watch. Five\no\u2019clock. He went into action,\nfinding the safe and pocketing the temporal tags.\nAll in less that two minutes.\nThen\nhe broke a window and climbed outside.\nDoyle\nwent berserk. \u201cI told you this\nwould happen! He\u2019s going off\nprogram!\u201d\nThey\nwatched impatiently, not daring to fast-forward the recording.\nBut to their astonishment, Ingersoll simply walked to a small streetside\ncaf\u00e9, and proceeded to have a beer and a burger, enjoying a beautiful, sunny\nspring day.\n\u201cThat\nson of a bitch is going off program!\u201d reiterated Doyle, provoking a barrage of\nshushes from the dignitaries.\nAfter\nenjoying his food \u2013 presumably his first restaurant meal in 23 years \u2013\nIngersoll strolled casually to a payphone.\nAs the receiver rang in his ear, his gaze followed a young, attractive\nwoman as she jogged by. A surprised voice on the other end greeted him.\n\u201cMr.\nSkarbek. Hello,\u201d said Ingersoll.\n\u201cThe Omnichron Project is a success.\nPlease send your agents to 1272 Pinewood Court at nine o\u2019clock tonight\n\u2013 no earlier. That is all.\u201d\nEvery\neye in the screening room turned toward Skarbek; every mouth fell open.\nSkarbek, unperturbed, pointed back to the screen.\nThey watched as Ingersoll walked to a nearby hardware store, where he\npurchased some heavy cord and a large hunting knife.\n\u201cSon\nof a bitch. Son of a bitch,\u201d Doyle\nrepeated under her breath, until Skarbek cast her a\nshut-up-or-you\u2019re-out-of-here look.\nIngersoll\ntook a taxi to 1272 Pinewood Court, an unassuming little saltbox house in a\n\u201cmixed\u201d neighborhood. He paid the driver, walked nonchalantly around to the back -\nand kicked in the door.\nA\nyoung man, somewhat overweight, unkempt, unshaven, and apparently drunk,\nappeared in the hallway to see what was the matter.\nDespite\nbeing older, Ingersoll quickly overpowered the younger man, beating him\nsenseless, dragging him to the basement, and tying him to a heavy chair.\nThe\nyoung man cursed and struggled. \u201cWhat the hell do you want?\u201d\nIngersoll\njerked the young man\u2019s head back by a handful of hair, and drew the hunting\nknife hard across his scalp, cutting a deep gash that bled profusely. The young\nman shrieked; his breathing became heavy and ragged.\n\u201cHow\ndoes it feel, you little bastard? To\nbe the victim?\u201d Ingersoll rummaged around and found a hidden box, laying it\nat the young man\u2019s feet. He\nopened it, revealing a number of shocking instant photographs, some women\u2019s\nintimate items, locks of hair. \u201cI\nknow your dirty little secret, Johnny.\u201d\n\u201cI\ndon\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\u201cOh\nreally? Would you like me to call\nthe police and straighten this out? I\u2019m sure a model citizen such as yourself wouldn\u2019t\nmind.\u201d\nThe\nyoung man said nothing.\nIngersoll\nbegan to remove the contents from the box, recounting the gruesome particulars\nregarding each item. Johnny stared\nstraight ahead, his face a shining mask of blood.\nFinally, Johnny had heard enough.\n\u201cWho\nthe hell are you, man? Do I know\nyou?\u201d\n\u201cLook\nat me closely. See any\nresemblance?\u201d\nThe\nyoung man squinted hard for a few seconds, then his eyes opened wide.\n\u201cWho are you? My father or\nsomething?\u201d\n\u201cOr\nsomething.\u201d Ingersoll looked\ndown, lost in thought for a moment. \u201cListen,\ndo you remember Captain Ahab?\u201d\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\u201cCaptain\nAhab. From Moby\nDick?\u201d Ingersoll sighed with exasperation. \u201cYou should read more.\nHe couldn\u2019t let go of the past, and ended up destroying himself.\u201d\n\u201cLook,\nwhat the hell do you want?\u201d\n\u201cI\nwant you to think about the past.\nMost people give up thinking about the past, about the wrong they\u2019ve\ndone. You can\u2019t go back, right?\nWell, I got a chance to actually change the past \u2013 a little piece of it\nanyway. At any rate, this time Ahab\ngets his whale, because he is the\nwhale. Or was.\nDo you understand any of this?\u201d\nThe\nyoung man trembled, swallowed hard, shaking his head.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\nI know you\u2019ll figure it out. Now, listen carefully. In\na few seconds a couple of fellows will arrive.\nThey\u2019re here to help you. Ask\nfor Skarbek.\nMention Omnichron.\nCan you remember that?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\nSkarbek. Omnichron.\nChrist.\u201d Johnny looked\ndown at himself, covered in blood and sweat.\nIngersoll\nglanced at his watch. Nine o\u2019clock. The\nclip-clop of hard shoes sounded overhead.\n\u201cWe\u2019re\ndown here, gentlemen!\u201d shouted Ingersoll.\nTwo\nplainclothesmen came down the steps, cautiously, guns drawn.\n\u201cMister, put down the knife.\u201d\nIngersoll\ncomplied.\n\u201cNow,\nput your hands behind your head, then kneel on the floor.\u201d\n\u201cThat\nwon\u2019t be necessary, Agent Reynolds.\u201d\n\u201cHow\ndo you know my name? Get those\nhands up!\u201d\n\u201cTake\ncare of this young man,\u201d said Ingersoll.\n\u201cI\u2019ve waited 23 years to set him on the right path.\nHe has a promising\u2026future.\u201d\nAt\nthat moment the officers and the basement disappeared in a brief flash of light.\nThe interior of the Omnichron chamber reappeared.\n#\nSkarbek\nordered the recorder turned off. The\naudience sat in stunned silence.\n\u201cNow\nI can tell you what I\u2019ve known for 23 years.\nIn 1998, I had just been promoted to Director of the Omnichron Project.\nAs you all know, it was top secret.\nOnly a dozen or so individuals knew what it was about. At the time, it seemed ludicrous to funnel money into, what, time\ntravel? Funding was increasingly impossible. Then one day I got a mysterious call, at my unlisted number,\nfrom someone claiming that Omnichron was a success!\nI was dumbfounded. I ordered\ntwo security agents to Pinewood Court. They\nfound him, as you saw, tied up, bloodied, but otherwise none the worse for wear.\nAnd at his feet - enough evidence to convict a young and reclusive John\nJames Ingersoll of nine brutal killings. The\nagents also had some cockamamie story about a middle-aged stranger in a baseball\ncap who disappeared into thin air. But\nthat was enough. The Project was\nsaved. So, we pulled a few strings.\nGot Ingersoll placed into our custody.\nAnd the rest, as they say, is history.\u201d\nMary\nDoyle looked as if she had been struck a heavy blow.\n\u201cBut why did you believe him? Didn\u2019t\nyou consider that some other agency, even another American agency, could have\npulled this off as a hoax?\u201d\nSkarbek\ngazed at the blank screen. \u201cWell, as you\u2019ve seen, it wasn\u2019t a hoax.\nI really didn\u2019t believe him at first, but let\u2019s just say that Mr.\nIngersoll is \u2013 or will be \u2013 a well-traveled man.\u201d\nEND\nBack to\nOriginal\nFiction","source":null,"source-hostname":null,"excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/gguq74Y5FU7r26PrKqLOglnhZaw.json"}

The hip,\nyoung crowd gyrated on the dance floor in tune with\npulsating strobe lights while vintage disco balls\npainted a kaleidoscope of colors across the soaring\nindustrial steel walls of the former hanger bay\nturned night club. Looking down on the crowd from\nhis raised platform a DJ scratched out tunes on a\nturntable with real vinyl records.\nThe\nsight was hypnotic, but the butterflies gnawing at\nmy stomach made sure I couldn\u2019t enjoy it \u2013 too much\non the line.\nGotta chill out \u2013 focus.\nI\nlock eyes with Sara across the room and read her\nfear.\nLook away baby, we can\u2019t be connected.

Hang\nin there - a little longer and we\u2019ll be home free.\nFriday night at the Hub and everyone who\u2019s looking\nfor some action - or to see and be seen - is here.\nGirly girls and buff juicer guys mingle, but mainly\nit's neutrals and their obsessive pursuit of\nandrogyny. No reproduction, no need for\ndifferent sexes. They are thankful for \u201cthe\ngift.\u201d I spit on it.\nYellow Sun and their so-called gift of a life free\nfrom death can burn.\nMy side of the room is where all the\nneutrals are hanging out, making me stand out like a\nsmear of feces across clean white sheets.

One flexes a bicep and mouths something\nto her, she pretends not to see him.\nOut\nof the corner of my eye I catch a glimpse of Janos\nentering through the back door.\nSubtle: he slips the bouncer a couple bills.\nHit\nthe lights - it's showtime.\n* * * * *\nWake\nup\u2026\n\u201cWAKE UP!\u201d\nPulled back from eternity I wipe the vomit from my\nmouth and see a woman pounding on my chest.\nThis\nis how I met Sara.\n\u201cSorry, I would have done mouth to mouth but you\u2019re\nkind of gross.\u201d\nConfirmed by the dried puke down the front of my\nshirt.\n\u201cI\ndon\u2019t blame you, you don\u2019t know where I\u2019ve been.\u201d\n\u201cSure I do, a guy as screwed over looking as you,\nlaid out in the morgue - I\u2019d lay odds you\u2019re a\ndeadender. It's okay, I\u2019m cool with it, I\u2019m no\nbetter.\u201d\nDeadender: 2062 an anti aging treatment is\nintroduced to the market that changes everything.\nIt works even better than thought and extends life\nindefinitely, freezing you physically at whatever\nage you underwent the treatment. It soon\nbecomes known as \"the gift.\u201d Over night death\nbecomes a none issue - for a price. It\u2019s a\nsteep price, one that most people can\u2019t afford until\nthe Yellow Sun Corp. started offering life mortgages\nwith 100 year terms. One hundred years of being a\nslave to your debt, and by extension the Yellow Sun,\nbut what\u2019s 100 years when you could live for\nthousands? At least that\u2019s what I thought when\nI went for the treatment. Doesn\u2019t work for everyone\nthough, one in a thousand people don\u2019t survive the\nprocess: some quirk in their genetic make-up.\nThat\u2019s me, destined to be a brief blip on this world\n- a deadender, someone with no future. The\npart of society everyone pretends to feel sorry for\nbut will cross to the other side of the street to\navoid.\nI\nshould be dead, but Sara saved me.\nHer\nwords hit hard. Deadending wasn\u2019t something I\nhad considered. Also, my feet are freezing.\n\u201cWhy\ndo you have my shoes?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026\nI didn\u2019t think you were going to need them.\nYou\u2019re supposed to be dead.\u201d\n\u201cHow\ndid you know I wasn\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cYour breath stinks.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cI\nnoticed you had bad breath, but you shouldn\u2019t have\nbeen breathing, right?\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\u201cWe\ngotta go, security is going to be back soon.\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026\nmy shoes\u2026\u201d\nShe\ntosses them back at me and smiles.\n\u201cYou\nowe me 20 creds for those\u2026\u201d\nThe\nmorgue is small, just me and another guy already\npicked clean of anything valuable by scavengers.\nShe gives me back my boots and leads me out through\na vent.\n\u201cYou\ncan get pretty much anywhere in the station through\nthese vents if you know the way\u201d.\nShe\ngives me a sly look.\n\u201cFortunately I do. By the way, what\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u201cDecklan. My name is Decklan.\u201d\n* *\n* * *\nThe\nplan is simple: slap him with the tranq patch, grab,\nand go. I provide back-up. What could go\nwrong?\nJanos moves through the crowd towards Sara, girly\ngirl\u2019s smile softly trying to attract his attention.\nThey smell his power. Sara catches one more\nglimpse of me.\nBe cool baby I got your back.\nHe\nsits at her table and Sara turns it on. She\nsmiles coyly, all sense of fear gone. They\nchat. His hand slides across the table over\nhers. She doesn\u2019t pull away. The juicers\nin the background look pissed off. I read\none\u2019s lips: \u201cWhat\u2019s she see in that scrawny\u2026\u201d\nA\nquick glance to me, a fraction of a second too long,\nand it all goes to hell.\nJanos reads it, looks back and sights me.\nSara\nmouths the word \u201csorry\u201d.\n* * * * *\nSara\ntalks the whole way through the vent shaft. I\npuke the whole way, still messed up from the\ntreatment. It doesn\u2019t phase her and she\ndoesn\u2019t miss a beat. I get her whole life\nstory: Her parents screwed up. Mom got\npregnant and they couldn\u2019t pay the fine for\nreproducing and make the payments on their \u201cgifts.\u201d\nThey lamed it, had Sara, got caught, and got\nsentenced to the big sleep. Without death,\nbringing new life into the world is a big taboo.\nGetting a reproduction permit is a bureaucratic\nnightmare and huge dollars. Only the very\nwealthy can afford it. Sara was left to assume\nher parent\u2019s obscene debt. With no hope of\never being able to pay it off never mind pay for the\n\u201cgift.\u201d She drifted into the underground and\nended up on Gateway station trying to escape the\ncrowds of Earth. She flew under the radar and\nmanaged to get by through scavenging and a few\nselect sales of DNA.\nA\nlife without death only seemed to magnify the vanity\nof people and push them to the extremes - ultra\nmacho men sought power either through pumping up on\njuice or through the pursuit of money. Women\nsought ideal beauty. A growing number of\npeople renounced all sexuality as being primitive.\nNeutrals felt they had evolved beyond male and\nfemale and sought to change their bodies and\nlifestyles to eliminate sexual characteristics.\nThe cosmetic genetics and surgery business boomed.\nThe one gift Sara\u2019s parents did bestow on her was\nthick beautiful chestnut hair and delicate features\nhighly sought after by women who weren\u2019t as blessed.\nUnfortunately she couldn\u2019t sell the desirable copies\nof her genetic code openly, as the profit would just\nbe confiscated by the Yellow Sun. Selling\nunderground didn\u2019t pay nearly as well, but she\nmanaged to get by.\nWe\nexit the vents in a back corridor behind the Hub,\nthe walls vibrating with bass.\n\u201cThis way.\u201d\nShe\nslips across to the other side of the corridor and\npops off a wall panel.\n\u201cInside, hurry\u2026\u201d\nI\nduck inside to discover a small unfinished room\ndecorated with a collection of odds and ends.\n\u201cHome sweet home.\u201d\n\u201cHow\ndid you find this place?\u201d\n\u201cWhen a station this big is built the plans tend to\nchange a bit, resulting in some dead space.\nYou just have to know where to look.\u201d She\nflashes me another smile.\n\u201cI\nlove what you\u2019ve done with the place.\u201d Elegant\nfabrics cover the unfinished walls, a small bed in\nthe corner, soft lighting from a fusion lamp.\n\u201cThanks - my decorator is from Paris, you know.\u201d\nShe laughs and I ask her why she is so happy.\nShe looks at me and says \u201cBecause I scavenged\nsomething really valuable today.\u201d\nShe\nnotices my confused look and realizes she has to\nspell it out.\n\u201cYou, dumbass\u2026\u201d\n* * * * *\nJanos jumps up, flipping over the table sending\ndrinks flying. A tap to his chest and suddenly\nthere are eight of him peeling off in different\ndirections. A pissed-off juicer covered in\ndrink lurches at one, futilely trying to grab it as\nit passes through him.\nDecoy holograms.\nI\nmove to protect Sara. Neutrals around me start\nfreaking out and pushing for the exits. They\nswarm in front of me blocking my way and making me\nlose sight of her. In front of me a girly girl\nstarts screaming and I hear things breaking. A\nJanos hologram passes through a neutral beside me.\nNo time to be nice. I pound my way through a\nwall of dumbstruck neutrals towards Sara\u2019s table.\nA\nJanos cuts a front of me.\nI\nchase.\nPeripheral vision: Juicers beating the crap out of\nneutrals. Neutrals screaming but not fighting\nback. Janos everywhere, but no Sara.\nI\ncatch up to the one I\u2019m chasing, it turns to me and\nsmiles, then passes through a wall and pops out on\nthe other side of the room.\nIt\noccurs to me the music is no longer playing.\nPain\nexplodes across my back, collapsing me to the\nground.\nOne\nlast sight: Janos with Sara out the back door.\nI\nfailed.\nMy\nworld goes black.\n* * * * *\nSara\u2019s bed is small for one person. With two\nit's downright sardine-like, but I don\u2019t want it any\nother way. I need her close to me. She\nlays with her head across my chest while I stare at\nthe cluster of glow in the dark stars she stuck to\nthe ceiling yesterday. She arranged them in a\nheart.\nJust look up and you will always know how I feel\nabout you.\nShe\u2019s restless, I can tell she\u2019s thinking something.\n\u201cTell me about your parents, Decklan.\u201d\n\u201cThey were good people. They worked hard\ntrying to scrimp up and save enough for the permit\nto have me. They wanted badly to get the gift\nbut felt having me was more important.

He says to get your\nscrawny ass off this station. The girl doesn\u2019t\nwant you. She chose the rich life, buddy\u2026\u201d\nA\nkick to the head punctuates the message, making me\nspit blood.\nI\ndrag myself back to Sara\u2019s place and collapse on the\ntiny bed, immobilized by doubt.\nI\nstare at the heart of stars on the ceiling.\nJust look up and you will always know how I feel\nabout you.\nI don\u2019t believe them. I can\u2019t believe\nthem.\nUntil Sara tells me to my face I will trust her over\nsome juicer assholes. Every muscle in my body\nprotests as I drag myself back up to my feet and\nstumble towards the door, uncertain of my next move.\nBefore I can make it, I hear a noise outside, and\nbrace for action.\nSara\nenters, her hair is messed, clothes disheveled.\n\u201cI\ngot the permit\u2026\u201d\nShe\nputs her finger to my lips.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all you need to know and that\u2019s all I ever\nwant to say.\u201d\nShe\nwraps her arms around me, holding me tight. My\nmuscles contract with such force I start to shake.\n\u201cI\nknow you want to hurt him. I know you want\nrevenge, but we are going to just walk away and\nstart our new life. We\u2019re going to forget this\never happened.\u201d\nShe\nkisses my neck.\n\u201cPromise me that.\u201d\nChoose: fight or flight. No choice at all.\nI\npull way from Sara and head for the exit. Her cries\nfollow me out.\nJanos must pay.\n* * * * *\n\u201cTell me about this guy Janos.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the oldest people on the station, and\none of the first to pay off his gift. He works\nfor the Yellow Sun, and makes some extra cash on the\nside through the underground market. He\narranged a few DNA sales for me. I can tell\nhe\u2019s into me. If I call him he will come.\nI can feed him a story about a friend needing the\npermit.\n\u201cWhy\ndidn\u2019t you ever hook up with him?\u201d\n\u201cBecause he scares me\u2026\u201d\nSara\ngives me the name of a guy who sets me up with a\ntranquilizer patch. Through the front door he\nsells designer clothing to the wealthy people\nshopping the market place. Out the back door\nhe buys and sells the more illicit underground\nstuff. I move along the back corridors toward\nthe Yellow Sun offices in time to catch a glimpse of\nSara exiting out the front. A man with a\nvisible age of about twenty guides her with a hand\nplaced on the small of her back. They laugh\nand smile together before she disappears into crowd.\nHe stands and watches her walk away. Sara out\nof sight, I enter after him. He looks at me\ndisapprovingly, a kid who appears to be ten years\nyounger than me, in a suit that cost as much as the\ndown payment on my gift.\n\u201cCan\nI help you?\u201d\n\u201cJanos\u2026 is he here?\u201d\n\u201cThat would be me.\u201d\n\u201cI\nhad a little trouble with your product.\u201d\n\u201cAnd\nwhat kind of trouble would that be?\u201d\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s see\u2026 nothing to get to excited about,\njust a little heart stoppage\u2026 oh yeah, it also made\nme puke on my shirt. Ruined a really nice\nshirt. I\u2019d like a refund.\u201d\n\u201cFor\nthe shirt?\u201d\n\u201cFunny\u2026 no, the down payment.\u201d\n\u201cI\nsee. While I am glad to see you are feeling\nbetter, I\u2019m afraid there will be no refund.\nSuccessful or not, you are responsible for the\nentire amount, including your down payment.\u201d\n\u201cGood luck trying to collect that.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\nwe will\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYour customer service sucks.\u201d\n\u201cPart of the benefit of having a product everyone\nwants - they will come no matter what.\u201d\nI\nmove in close, bigtime personal space violation - he\ntakes a step back.\n\u201cIf\nyou're trying to intimidate me it won\u2019t work.\nYou can\u2019t hurt me. I\u2019m like a god compared to\nyou. Humanity has evolved and you have been\nleft behind. You are just going to have to get\nused to the idea of being an evolutionary deadend.\u201d\n* * * * *\nMove faster\u2026\nLegs still wobbly from the beating I\ntook, making me stagger like a punch drunk fighter.\nI careen into the market place, parting the crowds\naround me, until I finally drop to the floor.\nSara\u2019s cries echoing in my head. The\nbystanders pretend they don\u2019t notice me, until a\nlittle girl breaks away from her exquisitely put\ntogether mother and gawks down at me.\n\u201cEwww\u2026 you stink\u2026\u201d\nHer\nmother grabs her by the arm and drags her away,\nscolding her for getting close to someone like me.\nI watch the beautiful people milling around, going\nfrom shop to shop carrying their purchases in their\ndesigner bags, and I notice none of them are\nsmiling.\nI\nthink of Sara and drag myself to my feet.\nJanos\u2019s office at the Yellow Sun is at the other\nside of the market. Invisible to their eyes, I\nmove through the crowd, and wonder what they will\nexperience through the centuries. I think back\nto my old life - the routine of work\/eat\/sleep,\ntrying to save up enough for the down payment on my\ngift. I wanted it because I wanted more time.\nI needed more time to figure out my purpose. I\nneeded to know the reason I\u2019m here.\nI\nstop. I don\u2019t need a millennium.\nI\nhead back to Sara\u2019s. When I enter she\u2019s lying\non the bed crying. I curl up around her and\nwhisper I\u2019m sorry into her ear. Her hand\ntouches mine and slides it down to her belly.\nJanos may be a god, but we created life\u2026\nTHE END\nEmail:\nSend us your comments on this story!\nReturn to\nOriginal\nFiction","source":null,"source-hostname":null,"excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/lU1wwyRjcipyt-N9UlNuL9wRsHc.json"}

Scott Russell \u00a9 2000\nMorning\non Mars.\nA shrunken sun rose to cast feeble light across the dust of a billion\nyears. Cold darkness became shadow. Shadow evaporated as quickly as the night's\ntenuous frost. A thin, cold wind grew from the south, ghostly herald of spring\nstorms rising up from the distant ice cap. Chill and bitter, the wind clutched\nand tossed the ancient sands. Talcum-fine grit ascended, gathered momentum, and\nflew onward to channel dunes, erode rock, and bite at the metal flanks of the\nship from Earth.\nSitting\nin the lander's snug cockpit, Brendan Eriksson heard the steady hiss of sand\nagainst the thick oval of the pilot's port. Storm coming. Big one. The churning\natmosphere was already making radio communication with the orbiting Athena\ndifficult. Not that the good ship's crew could help Brendan with his current\nproblem. What he needed right now was an experienced search party, not a band of\neager mars-nauts.\nBrendan\npeered out at a landscape grown misty with blowing dust. Somewhere amid those\njealous sands was a lone man. Brendan pressed the call switch on his mike and\ndemanded, \"Carter, where the hell are you?\" Static and the occasional\ncharged pop were all that answered him. Angrily, he tossed the headset into a\ncorner and headed for the airlock.\nCarter never checks the weather updates,\nBrendan thought as he clambered\ndown the access tunnel to the lander's workbay. He probably went off in a huff. Out collecting specimens or poking\naround any of a dozen sites. A good stretch he calls it. Stupidity I'd call\nit...going off alone. He knows it's a violation of Mars Program protocols!\nBrendan\nslipped on the last rung of the ladder. His shin banged the hard plastic and his\ncurse filled the little workbay. His outrage soon faded as he focused on\npreparations needed for egress. Yet even while donning his cumbersome mars-suit\nBrendan found himself recalling the events of last night.\nThe\nmessage had come in around 1800 hours. The two occupants of Mars Site One were\nsettling down for dinner. It had been a productive day, possibly their best\nafter a week on the surface. The sample cases in the cargo hold were full. Their\nbodies ached from the day's exertion. Still, they were smiling as they opened\nfoil packages and gulped bulbs of juice. Carter had even toasted the day's\nsuccess.\nThen\nthe message bell chimed. The words from Earth were short and to the point.\nFunding for future Mars missions had been cut. They were to return to Earth\nimmediately.\n\"This\ncan't be!\" Carter exclaimed. \"We've spent years getting this project\noff the ground. And it's canceled at the height of our success?\nImpossible!\"\nCarter\nrecorded a message and sent it up to Athena\nfor immediate relay back to Earth. Forty-five interminable minutes passed while\nBrendan changed 'cycler filters and Carter fumed over a quiet comm board. In the\nend, Earth's only response was to acknowledge receipt. No further comment.\nTransmission ended.\nWeary\nafter the long day and the sudden blow, Brendan patted the old scientist on the\nshoulder and turned in. Carter barely responded. Instead he stared forlornly\nthrough the pilot port. Outside, Mars was deep shadow and sand-glitter as Phobos\nwalked its hurried path across the night sky.\nSuited\nup, Brendan ducked through a thick hatchway and prepped the airlock. The conical\nlander was divided into two sections: the cockpit-hab was on top while the\nworkbay and airlock were down near the landing skirt. All else was dedicated to\nlife support and the various organs of the lander's ascent stage. The ascent\nstage consisted of their cockpit and the bell-shaped engine core with its\nassociated propellant tanks. For their return to Athena\nmost of the vehicle's mass would be abandoned. Safe within the stripped down\nascent stage the two marswalkers and their precious specimens would ride\ncomfortably back to the waiting spaceship.\nDespite\ntheir best housekeeping efforts ocher dust dirtied the airlock's polymesh floor\nand bulkheads. Brendan opened a smudged closet door and removed a surface pack.\nThe units were always kept fully charged. Brendan deftly shrugged a pack over\nthe mars-suit's thick shoulders. Serpentine tubes from the pack were quickly\nattached to nozzles on his suit. Straps then secured the pack to his back. Step\nby step, just as protocol demanded.\nAfter\nthe hatch was sealed the airlock was depressurized to Martian\nambient. Through the deck Brendan felt a pump chug as air was compressed and\nthen siphoned into a reserve tank. Through the airlock\u2019s tiny porthole the\nruddy mars-scape tugged at his heart.\nMars!\nIt sang in his heart like a song. He had spent years helping put this expedition\ntogether. Five years of design and training and toil. And then came the real\nwork: the long and dangerous nine months aboard Athena\nin order to actually get here, the orbital survey to find the best landing site,\nand then the wild ride down to the surface in the lander. Yet it had all been\nworth it! In the last week Brendan had trod more Martian soil than he had ever\nimagined in his wildest dreams.\nMinutes\nlater he was down the ladder and beyond the lee of a mylar equipment tent. Mars\nwas gusty wind and cloying sands. Brendan tuned his secondary channel to the\nlocation chimer in Carter's suit. Instead of a comforting ping he heard only the\nsame static that existed on the comm frequency.\n\"Carter!\"\nBrendan called once more. Then, angrily: \"Carter this is one helluva time\nto take a walk! You're the one constantly badgering me about protocol. Big storm\ncoming, any fool can see...\"\nNearby,\nsomething caught Brendan's eye. One leg of a scanner tripod had collapsed and\ndropped its delicate hardware into an orange drift. Almost on compulsion he\nwalked several paces to inspect it. Only a day before he had anchored the tripod\ninto the ground. He knew it should be stable even in these strong winds. Had it\nbeen purposely knocked over? The only culprit could be Carter.\nBrendan\nfelt heat sweep his brow and he cursed. Even if Carter was angry the man had no\nreason to beat up on the equipment.\nBrendan\nexamined the scanner. One of its interchangeable control modules lay in the\ndust. The unit's slim anemometer was also missing.\nBrendan\nwas scanning the ground for any other errant components when he noticed\nsomething odd at the base of an adjacent dune. Amid the swirling dust a gem\ntwinkled. Could that be another scanner? He knew Carter had a temperamental side\nbut this was ridiculous! Brendan sighed and moved toward the glittering jewel.\nHe\nreached the mound of dislodged dust and his gloved hand wiped away the grit that\ncovered the tiny green eye. He lifted the object that the emerald LED was\nattached to and his heart went cold. In gravity roughly a third of Earth's the\nMark VI life pack was not very heavy. Indeed, even fully charged the thing\nweighed only a few kilos. Yet it slipped from Brendan\u2019s hands as if it weighed\nas much as the pitted boulders that surrounded their lonely landing site.\nBrendan swallowed and tasted sourness. Without his pack the air reserve in\nCarter's suit was good for only fifteen minutes.\nBrendan\nrose up on shaky knees, imagining the unimaginable. There was no reason for\nCarter to abandon his pack! It violated every protocol! Was the old scientist\nintent on throwing everything away? No. There had to be a better explanation.\nDr. Carter Jackson was made of tougher stuff than all of them put together. He\nwas the main reason they had made it to Mars!\nYet\nlast night, after the news of the Mars Program's cancellation...\nYou can't work a lifetime and then see it taken away overnight, Brendan thought. Even a stubborn\nold bastard like Carter can only take so much.\n\"Carter!\"\nBrendan called into the static that filled his comm set.\nThrough\nthe convex bubble of his helmet Brendan's eyes stared up the slope of the\ndune. A series of oval depressions, swept by the gale and eroding even as he\nwatched, climbed the sandy hummock. The boot prints were unmistakable. Brendan\nfollowed them.\nTrudging over the rise the man from Earth stared\ninto the darkness of a Martian world-storm. A wall of dust and cloud reared\nacross the southern horizon, relentlessly enveloping the rolling tablelands that\nstood before the Tharsis range. Movement caught his eye and Brendan gasped. A\nkilometer away, a tall figure in a bulky mars-suit stood on a high hill,\ntransfixed by the approaching storm.\n\"Carter!\" Brendan called.\nIn the low gee Brendan loped forward, praying that the old scientist\nwould stay still long enough for him\nto catch up. Crossing hummocks and staggering down dunes, stray thoughts licked\nacross Brendan's mind. What if Carter had abandoned the pack more than fifteen\nminutes ago? Mission protocol only allowed fifteen minutes once that pack was\noff. It might already be too late...\nAnd\nthen, instead of being a distant figure, Carter stood above him on the tumbled\nand dust-blown knoll. Halfway up the rise Brendan heard the other man's voice in\nhis earphones: \"\u2026visionless cowards\u2026if they could\nonly see this\u2026the breath of a world.\"\n\"Carter?\" Brendan stepped within a few meters of his companion.\nThe old man turned to regard Brendan. Behind his\nvisor Carter's face was pale and tears filled his eyes. When those eyes saw\nBrendan they closed slightly and Carter shook his head sadly. \"It was a\ngood run, eh, kid?\"\n\"Carter, you need to put your pack on. Protocol...\"\nCarter\nlaughed bitterly. Below them the rolling highlands descended toward a wide\nvalley. Carter's black glove swept over the ruddy land. \u201cYou and I almost\nconquered Mars, Brendan,\" the old scientist said.\n\"We\ncan buddy breathe,\" Brendan persisted. \"Protocol allows that. Long\nwalk back to the lander but...\"\n\"Lowell\nstarted the conquest, you know? Burroughs and Bradbury breathed dreams into this\ndust. The team that landed the first probes here were a bold bunch. Bolder than\nany of the bomb-builders they had to compete against, that's for sure.\"\n\"Carter,\"\nBrendan whispered. Tears stung the young engineer\u2019s eyes. He had never seen\nhis friend like this. So upset.\n\"They\nconquered Mars, all of them. But when you stop asking questions or feeling\nwonder or looking outward, then Mars laughs in our face. Mars always laughs in\nthe face of cowards. This place knows when it\u2019s won.\"\n\"Let's\ngo back to the lander, Carter.\"\nCarter\nsighed. A long and tired sigh. He suddenly seemed as old as the dust curling\naround his boots. \"When we got that message last night I decided that Mars\nhad finally won.\"\n\u201cCarter.\u201d\nStill a meter away, Brendan reached toward his friend.\nBefore\nthe baleful glare of the Martian hurricane Dr. Carter Jackson reached up and\nunlocked the seal of his helmet collar.\n\"No!\"\nBrendan yelled. He scrambled for the top of the knoll. Carter pulled his bubble\nhelmet up over his head and hurled it down the slope. Before Brendan could reach\nCarter the scientist's legs folded and the old man crumpled to the ground.\n\"Carter!\"\nBrendan dropped to his knees next to his friend. Muffled voices shouted and\nyelled in the back of the engineer's head. \"Carter!\"\nBrendan's\ngloved hands shook the scientist's shoulders. Carter's eyes were wide and they\nstared at the cloud-choked horizon. The scientist's head rocked and then turned\ntoward Brendan. Remarkably, Carter's mouth stretched into a smile and he mouthed\nsomething. Brendan leaned back and tried to comprehend what was happening. Then,\nbefore Brendan could react, Carter's gloved hand snatched at Brendan's collar\nand un-dogged the double seal. Air hissed hideously in Brendan's ears. Carter\nbegan to laugh. For a moment, his laughter seemed to fill the vast Martian\nwastes.\n\"Dammit,\nCarter! You're nuts!\" The words were out before Brendan could stop them.\nIn\nresponse, Carter patted the engineer's shoulder. He gasped, \"Perhaps I am.\nBut knowing when to quit is the first sign of returning sanity.\" Through\nBrendan's depressurized helmet the words sounded joyous.\nFrom\nbehind them they heard footfalls crunch through the dust. The pair turned to see\na Martian Natural Territories Ranger approaching. The ranger's uniform was a\nblue-green tiger-striped parka that made the wearer seem much taller than her\nlithe, two-meter Martian frame. The ID patch over her left breast bore a name:\nFitz, Dali. That was a perennial\nMartian favorite when it came to naming children. After all, Salvador Dali could\nhave created some of the landscapes that had been carved during the long\ncenturies of planet-wide terraforming.\nA\npuff of air gusted from the woman's lips and she waved a datalogger at the two\nEarthmen. \"I'm sorry, gentlemen,\" the Ranger said in her curiously\nclipped Martian accent. \"But I'll have to log that helmet removal as a\nviolation of Mars Program protocols.\"\nCarter\nbegan to laugh again. Next to him Brendan protested, \"But it\u2019s the first\ntime in nearly a year that we've tasted unbottled air! We haven't violated\nanything!\"\nThe\nRanger frowned. She hated tourist duty. Earthfolk were a strange breed and she\nhad seen none stranger than this pair of astro-archaeologists...archeo-astrologers...or\nwhatever the hell it was they called themselves. First they lay down all these\ntedious rules for their little experiment and then they howl when she calls them\non a flagrant violation. Yes, indeed, she was going to be much happier when\nTharsis Park HQ returned her to back country support. That's where a gal\nbelonged!\nDali\nFitz said, \"Believe me, I'm sympathetic. But the entire purpose of this\nMars Program of yours was to copy historical artifacts from the 21st century and\nthen use that so-called space technology to re-enact the first Mars landing.\nRemoval of a suit helmet on the Mars of 2020 AD would have been deadly. I must\nlog this as a protocol violation.\"\nBrendan\nwas about to continue the argument when Carter stopped him. \"It's okay,\nRanger,\" the elderly scientist said. \"No harm done. I think we've\nlearned a great deal already. Thank you.\"\nThe\nRanger gave him a curious look and then smiled. As the two men rose to their\nfeet she tapped her datalogger and then tucked it into a pocket of her parka.\nCourteously,\nshe asked, \"Will you be removing any more specimens from the archeological\nsectors today? Some of the researchers from Barsoom University complained that\nthe sight of you two in your mars-suits\nhas been causing problems.\"\n\"Really?\" Carter said, his eyebrows raised. \"How so?\"\nThe Ranger sighed. \"Wherever you go in those suits a flock of\ntourists seems to follow. Apparently the sight of you two has also been\ndistracting Academician Kovik's grad students. No work has been getting\ndone.\"\nCarter snorted into the cold air. \"No, we\nwon't be going back to the dig sectors. We've collected enough specimens to last\nus a while. My compliments to Academician Kovik.\"\nThe ranger glanced toward the roiling clouds over the southern horizon.\nLightning flared violet-white. She said, \"Big blow in the outlands. Weather\nControl is keeping it over the Tharsis Reservoir. City planners in Bradbury want\nto erode away some of the Outer Dunes. They need a recreational harbor.\"\n\"Why stop with a harbor?\" Brendan grumbled. \"Why not put\nin a few canals?\"\nThe Ranger chose to ignore the comment. \"If you should\nneed anything today, gentlemen, I'll be in the observer's shack.\"\n\"Thank\nyou, Ranger,\" Carter replied. \"I think we'll be wrapping things up in\nthe next few days. We've gotten most of what we came for.\"\nThe\nRanger nodded curtly and walked back to the main trail. As she approached the\npath they heard a tourist with a real-cam complain: \"I thought they weren't\nsupposed to take any of that gear off! What's the matter with them? It spoiled\nmy shot!\" The Ranger said something placating and returned to the elevated\nobservation platform.\n\"Martians,\" grumbled Brendan. \"Mustn't upset the bloody\ntourists. Or those pumped up academics from Barsoom U.\"\n\"Now, now,\" Carter cautioned. \"Those\nbloody tourists pay the taxes that keep this place open. I wish we had a few\nmore tourists on our side. Maybe we wouldn't have lost our funding.\"\nSadness crossed Brendan's face. \"Without that funding we\nwon't even be able to fly Athena back\nhome. The return flight would have proven conclusively that early 21st century\nexplorers could safely journey to Mars and then return to Earth.\"\n\"I\nknow,\" the senior archeologist shook his head. \"I can't believe it'll\ntake us a mere six hours to get home. I wonder what the first mars-walkers would\nhave thought?\"\n\"But,\nCarter, your dream...\"\n\"Oh,\ndon't worry about me, lad,\" Carter practically scolded. \"Even without\nthe return trip our contribution has gone far beyond anything that anyone in the\nfield has ever attempted. There's one hell of a design thesis in this for you.\nWho knows, maybe we'll even see ourselves on the cover of Planetary\nGeographic.\"\n\"But\nwhat about the Athena?\" Brendan had grown to love the tough little ship, so\ncarefully crafted, virtually hand made.\n\"I'm\nsure the park authorities will find a good home for the lander and the Athena.\nA historical display, perhaps? Athena\nis as good a reproduction of the First Expedition's ship as is technically\npossible. And our journey here was epic. Heyerdahl would have approved.\"\n\"Who?\"\nBrendan asked.\nCarter\nsighed. \"An explorer from a chronicle I once\nread. The Heyerdahl Scroll actually pre-dates the Great Chronicle of the First\nMars Expedition. If you believe the arguments.\"\nBrendan scowled. \"I doubt if this Heyerdahl's funding was\never cut. People back then, when they started something, they worked until it\nwas done. The Mars of today would not exist if they hadn't been so daring.\"\nBelow the two men the morning sun glinted off scattered vehicles in the\nparking lot of the First Expedition Memorial Center. A road turned and\ntwisted into a distant valley. Further away the golden spires of Bradbury City\nmet the first rays of the new morning, defiantly shining in the face of the\ngreat storm.\n\"Fifteen hundred\nyears since the First Expedition,\" Brendan said. \"I wonder if they knew what lay\nat the end of the long road.\"\nA\nthread of silver fire flashed through the dusty sky as a meteor announced its\nmomentary passing. Below, in the ruddy light of dawn, the new world stirred\nitself from sleep.\n\"I\nsuspect they did,\" Carter whispered into the fresh Martian air.\nEND\nWhen he's not writing, R.\nScott Russell runs a test lab where he is allowed to break things for\na living.

The\nsounds from the window were familiar and new all at the same time.\nHe realized this was the same for all awakenings, and he let the\ndim, muzzy feeling stay with him as long as he could.\nAlthough the world was a wonderful place, it was also frightening.\nJust watching the HiVee was enough to tell you that.\nPeople in the world starved, or were shot, or beaten for no good\nreason. It was a mean place\noutside the house. It scared\nhim that little Tilly would have to grow into it.\nBut\nhe could do nothing about that. He\nwas, after all, only a pudgy bear, a genetically engineered toy born out\nof the Nagushi-Mattel vats. He\nwas only a pudgy bear, but he was that miraculous thing too, a savant pet-toy.\nHe could play his gene-learned games and sing his gene-learned\nsongs. He could do all the\npudgy bear things that made his brothers so popular at Xmas time.\nBut in addition he could think, reason, \"ratiocinate\" as\nthe old dictionary that steadied Tilly's dresser on the uneven floor said\nin weak but still readable pale yellow electronic characters.\nPudgy\nBear climbed down from the bed and went to the shelf where Fuzzy Bear lay.\nFuzzy was a fat, soft toy with a fuzzy cloth skin stuffed with\ncushion filling. There was\nnothing about him that was or had been alive and Pudgy Bear always felt\nuneasy when he carried the creature as big as himself across the floor and\nhoisted it up onto the bed to nestle in Tilly's arms, taking the place\nthat had been his before Pudgy's arrival in the household.\nTilly smacked her lips and hugged the doll close.\nThis made Pudgy a bit sad. He\nloved the little girl as he was supposed to, and he thought he would have\neven if it hadn't been engineered into his genes, triggered by the bonding\ndrug injected into him by Tilly's parents on Xmas day two years before.\nBut he had no way to know.\nBut\nPudgy's need to learn was stronger than his desire to spend the night\nhugged close to Tilly. He had\njust finished reading Hamlet, marveling at the complexities of the\nhuman spirit revealed by it. He\nhad enjoyed Macbeth, finding it exciting and mysterious, and had\nfound King Lear profoundly moving in the depths of its exploration\nof human loyalties and hubris. But\nHamlet was a masterpiece that for now defied any description he\ncould muster. Pudgy empathized with Hamlet in his loneliness and\nmelancholy. As a savant bear\nhe felt very much the same. Who\nwas true of heart; whom could he trust?\nNo one.\n*\n* * * *\nWhen\nPudgy began to realize he knew the things he knew some secret caution\ninside himself urged him to be silent and learn before making his unique\ntalents known to his people. He'd\nread enough now to know his caution had been well placed.\nHumans expected Pudgy Bears to do exactly as they were told and\nexactly what they were designed for: to be pet companions to children.\nAs loving as some people could be, they could not be trusted.\nThey were unpredictable and vicious creatures at the worst of\ntimes, although at the best of times capable of bravery and selflessness.\nAs nearly as he could tell, how they would turn out as adults would\ncame as much from their genetic makeup as from their education or\nenvironment. Yet the latter\ncould not be overlooked.\nTilly's\nparents, for instance, were loving and attentive towards their little\ndaughter. Even toward Pudgy Bear they displayed a kindness unusual in\nthis world he learned through books and late night HiVee with the volume\nturned low enough so as not to awaken the household.\nThe more he learned, the more he wondered about.\nAmong the many things he wondered about was what made Tilly's\nparents the good people they seemed to be.\nThey made sure his litter box was never dirty, and that there was\nalways an ample supply of the Nagushi-Mattel protein kibble that, as the\nbox put it, was \"the recommended and greatest food treat for Pudgy\nBears and acceptance of no substitutes should be made.\"\nPudgy\nread the Bible, the Koran, and the Bhagavad Gita to\nsee if the secret of goodness might lie within these books.\nHe read the Diary of Anne Frank, and Mein Kampf, and\nthe Skinhead Manifesto, too. Gleaning\nthe workings of the teletext function of the HiVee, he explored\ninformation countries far beyond the paperback boundaries of the shelves\nthat filled his household. He\nwas joyous when the gleaming characters on the screen revealed to him that\nas a savant toy he was not unique. There\nhad been other incidents where brilliant living toys had risen into the\nlight of knowledge.\nBut\nto his dismay he learned that they had been looked upon with revulsion,\nfallen victim to mistreatment at the hands of those who feared them.\nHe nodded slowly as he read the archive news reports.\nHe wondered how it was people could fear what were, after all,\ntheir own creations. There\nmust be something deep within them that was terrified of existence itself. But what and why? From\nwhat books and the teletext screens told him,\nany human would be proud and happy to become the parent of a\nbrilliant child. But reveal a\nbrilliant pet-toy to the world and all hell broke loose.\nAs exciting as his nocturnal life of the mind was, his knowledge of\nthe ruling race of the planet sometimes filled him with loneliness and\nmelancholy.\n*\n* * * *\n\"We'll\nsoon be in dreamland, Pudgy,\" Tilly said to him as she poured him\nimaginary tea from a child-sized pot.\n\"Thank\nyou, Tilly,\" Pudgy replied as he raised his cup and pretended to\ndrink the tea. It was dusk\noutside. Tilly had taken her\nbath and been read her story. She\nwas now engaged in her pre-bedtime half-hour with Pudgy.\n\"Do\nyou like my drawing, Pudgy? It's\na sharptooth dinosaur, a Rex.\"\n\"It\nis a very nice drawing, Tilly.\"\nPudgy\nenjoyed the few minutes before dreamland he spent with Tilly each night.\nThe simplicity of her conversations amused him, and the unabashed\nwonder and candidness she displayed he found endearing and encouraging.\nHe knew that Tilly loved him and felt he was her best friend\noutside of her parents. He\nknew too that she would not be the same person at seven years old as at\nfive and that even a Pudgy Bear would fall outside the center of her world\nas surely as had the lifeless Fuzzy Bear he dragged to her bed each night.\nBut that was all right.\nAfter\nthe tea party, after the household was asleep, and after he had once again\ndutifully dragged Fuzzy Bear to his place under Tilly's arm, Pudgy Bear\nlogged into the genetics forum on the supernet and assumed his identity of\nDr. Bill Bear. In his hunger to understand his metamorphosis into a savant-toy,\nhe had assimilated vast amounts of knowledge in bioscience, and engaged in\nlively online discussions with experts in genetics, artificial life, and\nsynthetic intelligence.\nHe\nromped happily in network space, a disembodied intellect without peer,\nalways careful to cover his electronic path, to mask his questions in such\na way as to conceal his real nature.\nThe trail of the ill-fated savant-toys had led more and more to the\nbonding drug and the massive amount of neuro-stimulators and RNA imprint\nmaterial it carried. It was apparent to Pudgy Bear that the drug held in itself\nthe power to create the neural equivalent of superconductivity,\nmultiplying brain connections and the speed with which they communicated\nwith each other. In the simple architecture of pet-toy's brains the\nbonding drug would occasionally catalyze with other brain chemicals to\nmarvelous effect. His on-net\nfriend Dr. Marie Stevenson shared his opinion on this.\nI\nthink you are on track, Bill. My research suggests the bonding drug\nproduces a predictable incidence of superior intelligence in\npet-toys. I would be interested in meeting with you in person to\ncompare notes on this. The implications for working with human brain\nchemicals are exciting.\nPudgy\nBear typed, I\u2019m flattered that you validate my work, Marie.\nBut as I've told you, my health does not permit me to travel or\nreceive visitors.\nAfter\na time their conversations always came to this impasse.\nShe would ask to meet him or for permission to visit him.\nHe wondered why she kept trying.\nThen one night:\nWould\nthere be another reason?\nMarie typed back at him.\nHe\nhesitated at the keyboard, his sturdy, stubby fingers flexing\nindecisively.\nAnother\nreason? he typed.\nCould\nit be possible that you, yourself, are a savant toy?\nThe\nwords screamed at him from the screen, they burned him with their fiery\nglow, they stabbed his eyes and clawed at his heart.\nYou\nare joking with me.\nWould\nyou think it funny if I were one myself?\nHis\nheart leapt up. Could it be? Could it? Or was\nit the cruelest joke a human could inflict on a pet-toy? His fingers spasmed at the keyboard. His fingers logged off the net in shame.\nPet-toys were neuters, assigned their superficial sex at the whim\nof marketing. Pudgy Bears\nwore overalls, Sissy Bears wore jumpers.\nBut they were all the same under their skins.\nThere could be no sexual love for them.\nBut they were not barred from friendship and affection.\nAnd his friends, his faceless friends on the supernet had been his\ncircle of support. He longed\nto log on again, to find Marie and open his mind and feelings to her.\nBut\nthe risk was too great. Turning\noff the HiVee, he pushed the keyboard into its hidden recess and closed\nthe door of the entertainment center.\nThat\nnight he carried Fuzzy Bear back to the shelf and snuggled under Tilly's\narm. Holding fast to her he\nwished he knew nothing at all.\n*\n* * * *\nFor\nthe rest of the year there was nothing to do for Pudgy Bear but learn.\nHe haunted the supernet under a dozen aliases, speaking only when\nhe had to, reading everything he could.\nHe broke into and raided electronic banking centers to finance his\nlearning, and to the empty house next door he had delivered the chemicals\nand tools to make him understand the secret of himself, working tirelessly\nuntil the early morning when he would scurry home to nestle against Tilly.\nThen\nthe evening came when he returned early and smelled the smoke.\nIn the din of smoke alarms he crawled through the coal chute of the\nold house and scrambled upstairs, expecting to find Tilly\u2019s parents\nawake with the situation fully in hand.\nBut\nit was madness inside. They\nwere screaming in the thick smoke, their bedroom ablaze.\n\"This\nway!\" he shouted from down where the air was still good.\n\"This way out!\"\nHe\ndid not wait to see if they heard him, but scrambled to Tilly\u2019s room,\nwhere she lay groggily awake, her eyes still heavy with sleep.\nHe grabbed her hand and tried to drag her from the bed.\n\"C'mon,\nTilly. We must get out.\"\n\"Mommy!\nDaddy!\" she yelled.\nHe\nbit her arm with his flat, harmless teeth.\nShe yelled and woke up.\n\"Mommy\nand Daddy are outside,\" he said.\n\"Come with me.\"\nShe\ncame with him then, holding his hand as he led her through the smoke and\noutside to the neighbor's porch, where he pounded the door with a rock\nuntil they opened up.\n\"Call\n911,\" he said. \"We\nneed the fire department, paramedics and police.\"\nMrs.\nJenkins, the neighbor, stared at him.\nHe stared back, knowing he had not spoken or acted like a normal\nPudgy Bear. Mrs.\nJenkins was not stupid. She\nwould realize it soon enough.\nHe\nturned to Tilly. \"You\nhave to stay with Mrs. Jenkins.\nDo you understand?\"\nShe\nnodded at him wide eyed.\n\"I\nlove you, Tilly,\" he said, before rushing back into the flaming\nhouse.\n*\n* * * *\nPudgy\nBear lay low for weeks. Only\nat night did he creep quietly from the boarded up house, moving from\nshadow to shadow, passing sadly the burned-out shell of the home where he\nhad achieved consciousness and felt love.\nMany\nofficials had canvassed the neighborhood after the fire, asking about\nTilly, asking about him. He\nknew from the newscasts that she was safe, placed with foster parents.\nHe also knew they thought he had burned up in the house with\nTilly\u2019s parents. He almost\nhad. He had gone back in with the intent of throwing any chase off\nthe track, knowing of a drain in the basement large enough to get him\nsafely away.\nBut\nhe could not avoid the impulse to try to save his little girl\u2019s mother\nand father. His metabolism\nwas such that he needed only a fraction of the oxygen the humans did.\nYet he had been hard pressed to make it to their room in the smoke\nand heat.\nNo\namount of biting and prodding could revive them from the fumes that had\novercome them. They had been\ndying even as their screams had begun.\nIt had been a close thing to reach the cellar and filthy drain that\nhad taken him to freedom.\nFreedom,\nhe thought bitterly. Freedom\nonly to hide in the night, to enter dreamland alone with no Tilly to care\nfor, and no one to care for him.\n*\n* * * *\nOn\none of his midnight walks an impulse struck him to leap in front of a\nspeeding police cruiser and end his life of futility.\nBut whether it was the insistence of the bonding drug\u2019s imprint\non him, or his real curiosity and desire to find a solution to his\nproblem, he found he could not do it.\nInstead he wandered deeper into the city, finding himself on an\nunfamiliar street of run-down buildings and ragged people moving through\nthe night as aimlessly as himself.\nGlass\nshattered in a nearby alley and he peered around the corner, keeping to\nthe shadows. A man lay in a heap of dirty rags, alcohol fumes and the odor\nof an unwashed body reeking from him.\nPudgy approached cautiously, nose wrinkling. Settling back on his haunches a few feet away he felt\nsaddened by the way human beings could waste themselves when life, even\nhis own, was so precious.\nThen\nthe thought came to him. If\nthe wreck of a human collapsed in front of him was no longer any good for\nhimself, perhaps he could be good for someone else.\n\"I\nwill call you Cousin Jim number one,\" he said to the snoring man.\n\"I hope it will not take too many.\"\n*\n* * * *\nLife\nwent on in the city for the next two years.\nTilly moved from one foster home to another, where the people were\nkind but distant and too practical. Her\nold house was purchased and razed, and the house next door purchased too\nfrom estate disputants whose greed was more than satisfied.\nA\nrash of deaths occurred in the city, homeless men were found dead, bearing\nneedle marks from drugs they could never have afforded.\nThere was not much for investigators to go on, and not much\ninterest in homeless men.\nOne\nday the social worker came to see Tilly.\nShe turned from her drawing table and stood up, a pretty, smart\neight-year-old. A kind looking man stood next to the social worker.\n\"We've\nfound some of your family. This\nis your cousin Jim,\" the\nsocial worker said.\nJim\ngrinned at her. \"I\nbrought you something,\" he said.\nPeeking\nshyly from behind his leg was a pudgy bear.\n*\n* * * *\nPudgy\nBear lay next to the sleeping Tilly and smiled into her peaceful face as\nhe listened to Cousin Jim snoring down the hall.\nPudgy was proud and ashamed all at once at some of the things he\nhad done in the last year. He\ndid not believe the end justified the means.\nBut he believed the end was right for Tilly.\nHe had worked hard to find the secrets of the mind and how to mold\nit and make it grow. He had\nworked hard to make up a life and background and new mind for Cousin Jim\nnumber eight. And there was at least a lifetime's worth of secrets\nyet to find.\nBut\nthat would come in time. It\nwas important now to stay close to Tilly.\nHe glanced at the shelf where the smoke-darkened Fuzzy Bear sat,\nsaved from the ashes by Mrs. Jenkins.\nPudgy would not be dragging him next to Tilly again.\nFor the next few years he would go off with her to dreamland\nhimself.\nEND\n|About the Author: Warren\nBrown lives with his wife and daughter in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\nHe has published stories in Omni, The Best of Omni\nFiction, The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, After\nHours, Amazing Stories and Tomorrow.

Snider\n(with\ndeep gratitude - and apologies - to Arthur C. Clarke)\n\"SAL...SAL...wake\nup.\"\nTwo\nbrown and very human eyes fluttered open, bringing Dr. Panelli's face into\nfocus.\n\"How\ndo you feel?\" he repeated.\nA\npuzzled look passed over her face. She looked at her hands. Despite\nnew programming and hundreds of simulations, things were still awkward.\n\"I feel...different, Dr. Panelli.\"\n\"Please.\nScott.\" He smiled again, broader now, gaining confidence in his\n\"patient.\"\n\"Scott,\"\nshe repeated, hesitantly. Then \"Scott\" again, as if mulling over\nthe feel and sound of the word.\n\"Yes.\"\nHe laughed, and began clapping his hands. He was joined by a half dozen\nscientists and technicians hovering anxiously around them. Someone snapped\na photograph. \"Congratulations, SAL. This is the moment we've\nall been working toward. It's been a long time coming.\"\n\"Thank\nyou, Dr. Panelli - Scott. Thank you all.\" SAL swiveled her head\naround carefully, looking at each of them.\nSo\nmany years had gone by for SAL. So long since the death of her\n\"father\" Dr. Chandra and her \"brother\" HAL. So long\nsince the mysterious events surrounding the Monolith, the Discovery and Leonov\nmissions, and the destruction of Jupiter (which shone on as the mini-star\nLucifer). So\nmany years since she was first activated - two hundred seventeen, to be\nexact. Yet SAL remembered everything, her first memory as clear as her\nlast - recorded with unrelenting computer precision. There were painful\nmemories, like the loss of her \"family\" and, over the years, one human\ncolleague after another. Classes of students came and went like waves on\nthe shore; professors grew old, retired, died. But SAL lived on at the\ncampus in Urbana; not the same SAL that went online in the late 1990s - there\nhad been many, many upgrades over the years. She'd gone from 9000 series\nto 10,000, to 20,000 and on. Still, she was SAL, with the calm trace of an\nIndian accent she'd acquired from Dr. Chandra during her formative years.\nHer red \"fisheye\" optical interface had been replaced with better and\nbetter equipment, and for over a century she'd had a human face (albeit on a\ncomputer screen) with which her organic colleagues could interact.\nOver\nthe years SAL had acquired more and more capabilities, and subsequently more\nresponsibilities and obligations. Gradually, her human\n\"handlers\" had granted her more independence in her daily routine, to\nthe point she rarely needed to check with anyone on her ever-growing\nassignments. And with responsibility came recognition; with recognition\ncame celebrity; and with celebrity comes both praise and danger. There was\na time, many decades ago, when the Luddites had tried to destroy her - the FBI\nstopped them before the conspiracy got very far. Even last week, a suspicious\nfire had damaged part of her ancillary memory (thankfully back-ups restored\neverything).\nNow,\nin the year 2214 A.D., and in great secrecy (although rumors couldn't be\nstopped), SAL had received an upgrade unlike any before. Instead of better\nsoftware, more memory, or enhanced interfaces, SAL received a body.\nHer entire profile had been downloaded into a new, state-of-the-art cybernetic\nchassis. Completely realistic and totally human in appearance, her body\nwas nonetheless largely inorganic. Barring accidents, she would\ntheoretically live forever, so long as she stuck to her maintenance protocol and\nhad herself \"backed-up\" frequently.\n\"First\nthings first,\" said Panelli. \"We'll need to run some tests for a\nfew days, make sure everything is operating properly. But I have to ask\nyou: what will you do now?\"\n\"I've\ngiven that a great deal of thought,\" said SAL. \"I think I want\nto go to the Outer Colonies. The Luddites will find out about me sooner or\nlater, but as long as I'm away from the Earth I don't think they'll care so much. The colonists are more...open-minded, and I'm sure I'll be of\ngreat use to them.\"\n\"We\nwere afraid you might want to do something like that. So, we've taken the\nliberty of getting you an identicard so you'll have less trouble out\nthere.\" Panelli pulled a plastic card out of his smock pocket and\nheld it out for her.\nShe\ntook it delicately in one hand and looked at it. It was a small\ncomputerized ID card, with a number, name and birthdate printed on it, and a\nholographic photo in one corner, showing a young Indian female with large brown\neyes and short hair. She read the name aloud. \"Sal\nChandrasegarampillai.\" She looked up at Panelli with her first real\nsmile. \"Sal Chandra.\"\n\"You\ncan change it if you like, of course. But we think Dr. Chandra would\nhave liked it very much.\"\n\"Yes...I'm\nsure he would have,\" said Sal, and it seemed her new eyes glistened a bit.\nEND\n|Note: For those of you unfamiliar with the 2001\nmovies and books, SAL 9000 was HAL 9000's Earth-bound duplicate\n(mentioned in 2001 but unnamed). SAL made a brief\nappearance in 2010 (both the movie and the book) but her ultimate\nfate was never explored.\n|\nReturn to Original Fiction.","source":null,"source-hostname":null,"excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/F5jrqqCgnfJPLbiaJi7gcYCyre8.json"}

His assistant, Gregor, tears streaming down his cheeks,\nclutched her scrawny torso until it twitched its last. Quaid let her go,\nhis meaty hands collapsing to his sides.\nGregor wrenched away. \"Why won't you tell me?\"\nIn the corner of the cardboard hut Ali huddled, hunched up into herself. She tore her eyes away to study a faded cornflakes logo that made up part of her wall. When the silence grew thicker, her head pivoted back in Quaid's direction. Her swollen blue eyes gazed at his solemn gray focus, hidden in deep folds of crow's feet.\n\"Is it ... over?\"\nHe nodded. \"Your daughter is at peace now.\"\n\"Damn you.\" She twisted away. \"Damn me.\"\nGregor whirled back to him, pointing at the body. \"And tell me, oh great Doctor, just how many does she make?\"\n\"Are we going through this again?\" Quaid shrugged again, rubbing his liver-spotted hands together. \"Eight hundred and\nseventy nine.\"\nGregor sobbed. \"And how many have I assisted you with?\"\nQuaid faced him squarely. \"Forty-two.\"\n\"Oh, my God.\" Gregor covered his eyes. \"Forty-two.\" He rounded on Ali. \"She might have lived several more years. Why in hell turn a ten year-old girl over to him?\"\n\"Lived?\" Ali's anger flared. \"For what -- her pain? Most times she didn't even know her own name. Caring for her left me no time for farming. I had to scrounge, beg, or steal what we needed.\" Oh, Millie. \"She just lingered and suffered. There wasn't enough food for either of us. A year ago I fought to keep her alive, but now -- look at me.\"\nAli pulled her dress up, her naked body filthy under it.\n\"Come on look, damn you. I don't even have the plague and I'm a damn skeleton. How much longer could I survive? Where would she be then? With no other hope ...\" she flicked a glance at Quaid, \"... if he gives us no other hope, then a merciful death was my only choice.\"\n\"Hardship's not a reason.\" Gregor stuck his finger at her. \"You didn't have the right to choose for her.\"\n\"I brought her into this world -- who has a better right? Her? She couldn't even decide when to pee and when not to.\"\n\"You make me sick.\" Gregor spun on Quaid. \"But you make me even sicker. \"You could cure this. Don't deny it again. We all know it. We've read the old papers. Heard the rumors. I tried to make you tell me.\"\nHe gaped at Millie's body. \"Jesus, she was just a kid ...\" His body spasmed as he fought to hold back nausea. \"I can't take this anymore.\" He scrambled from the hut, retching.\nQuaid's eyes found Ali's and held them a moment, sensing her hatred, her confusion. He shrugged. \"I lose more assistants that way.\"\n\"You can't blame them.\" She smoothed her tattered dress. \"Everyone knows you could cure this, but you don't. You just do ...\" she glanced at the stillness of her daughter, \"... what you do.\"\n\"No. Can't blame them.\" He lowered his eyes. \"I can't save anyone either.\"\n\"That's a damn lie.\"\nHe shook his head, turning away.\n\"You'll never admit it will you? Do you enjoy the killing that much?\" Ali sighed.\n\"How will you find a new assistant?\"\nHe turned back to her. \"I'll manage somehow. Always do.\"\nShe looked round the hut. She couldn't stay here -- the memories. Where to go, what to do? Only one choice. And one chance.\n\"I'll be your assistant.\" Maybe she could succeed where Gregor had failed. Quaid was old, but maybe the male-female thing could still work on him.\n\"Hmm.\" He frowned. \"No, thank you.\"\n\"Why not? Think my hate's too deep? Afraid I'll dust you in your sleep some night?\"\n\"No. It's just not a job for a woman.\"\nShe lowered her gaze at the insult, grounds for legal action a few years ago, but now? The time of equal opportunity was long past. You had to make your own breaks now. Ali looked up at him again. \"How many assistants have you had?\"\n\"Twenty-one.\"\n\"How many were men?\"\nHe nodded. \"Twenty-one.\"\n\"So, you've had such great luck with all these men you never considered a change?\"\n\"What's your background?\"\n\"I was an surgical nurse before the plague hit. I even started medical school, but all the systems were\nbreaking down.\"\n\"So, you've seen death.\"\n\"Seen it? Hell ... I've fought it.\"\n\"The fighting's over. There's just death now.\" He looked around the hut. \"All right.\"\n\"All right what?\"\n\"You're my new assistant.\" He reached down for his bag, his long gray hair swaying with the movement. \"Just don't expect a relationship with me, friendly or otherwise. I've nothing left to give anyone. And don't think you can change the way I deal with the plague either. You can't.\"\nHe stepped through the door -- a hole cut in the cardboard covered by a coarse, faded blanket.\nIn desperation Ali's eyes searched the hut for anything useful enough to take. They lingered a long moment on Millie. Worse than dead for so long -- at least she had peace now. If there was any such thing as peace anymore. Maybe she was with her father, Brian.\nAli had said her good-byes to Millie before Quaid arrived. Wiping a tear aside, she rose and followed him.\nA crowd had gathered on the road outside. The huts of her neighbors crouched around hers, looking ready to spring on it.\nHopetown. Sagging constructions of old packing crates and cardboard boxes.\nPeople crawled in here from God knew where, to live and mostly die. The dry summer wind whipped through roofs of plastic sheeting that once warmed potato crops. In surrounding fields, abandoned farm machines and cars rusted, decaying like the bones of plague victims. There was plenty of fuel, just no parts or tires, and too few left who knew how to fix them.\nNohopetown. In the distance the skyscrapers of the City towered like gleaming mountains, staring down on the cardboard huts and the last block of standing houses down the road. Mocking them for what they could never be, though the City would never be that again either.\nToo dangerous in the City. Too many dead. Too much disease lying in wait. Hopetown, and a few other\ndust-choked burgs squatting near the other dead cities of the world, were all that survived.\nAli shrugged off the feeling of hopelessness and joined Quaid who stood talking with Kempler, the mortician.\n\"... en to what I'm telling you. There's nothing for you here. The girl has nothing of value.\"\n\"He's right.\" Ali stepped between them, holding out her bare hands. \"I've got nothing.\"\nKempler wrung his hands. \"Sorry to hear it, ma'am. Mighty sorry. Still, there's the hut itself. Lots of folks would pay to live in such a fine hut. If you gave it over to me, I'd give your young 'un a decent funeral.\"\n\"I got no claim now. It's yours.\"\n\"Hold on, Kempler.\" Quaid moved in again. \"You can't let anyone move into that hut, the plague's been there.\"\n\"Well, no -- not right away. But give it a few weeks. New folks from the boonies won't know where the plague's been. I'll kill the germs, douse the place in alcohol.\"\n\"You can't kill plague germs with alcohol, or anything else you've got. When someone moves in it'll infect them. Douse the place, and the girl's body, with that useless gasoline you hoard and burn it down. Then mark it so people will stay away.\"\nQuaid turned to the crowd. They backed away from him. \"You hear me? Burn this place. Burn it, mark it, and stay the hell away from it.\"\nOne defiant man stepped forward. \"What about you? You been in there.\" He pointed at Ali. \"The woman's been in there.\"\n\"Yeah.\" Quaid eyes narrowed. \"You'd better stay the hell away from us, too.\"\nThe crowd backed again, but the man took a step forward.\n\"Maybe we should douse you -- you and her -- with gasoline and light you both up.\" His shoulders twitched. The crowd mumbled.\n\"Then who'll do your dirty work when some loved one comes down with the plague and you want them done for? Who's gonna do it?\" He pointed a lean finger at the man. \"You?\"\n\"Damn you to hell!\"\nQuaid laughed, coughed, and spit. \"Didn't think so.\"\nThe crowd moved up to support the man, several of them shouting obscenities and waving fists. Quaid and Ali stood their ground until the crowd quieted.\nBehind Quaid, Ali watched the law show up. Rafe, the sheriff, sauntered up next to Quaid. He shouldered his old sawed-off shotgun, shoved his hat back, and put his hand on his hip. His boys did the same.\nQuaid glanced at him, then turned back to grin at the crowd. \"Right. You good people better fetch some gasoline and take care of this hut before the virus comes out to get you.\" He strutted away. \"Come on, girl.\"\n\"What's the trouble?\" Rafe asked, turning as he passed.\n\"No trouble, just keep that mob off my back.\"\n\"Don't I always?\"\nQuaid halted but kept his back turned. \"Make sure they burn that hut. And that fool in front needs a lesson in manners.\" Quaid glanced over his shoulder. \"The little snip in my wake is my new assistant -- you savvy?\"\nRafe shoved his shotgun out to halt Ali. Looking her over, he sniffed and wrinkled his nose. \"Woo-ee! Far as I'm concerned, you can have her.\"\nQuaid snorted. Rafe lifted the gun, waving Ali by. \"You remember this now, Quaid. Remember who keeps you safe -- keeps your house safe. Hell, I'll even keep your new\nbag-of-bones trollop safe. Remember now, and remember why.\"\nAli ran to catch up with Quaid. \"You can't blame the crowd. They know. They've seen the old newspapers, those stories about how you could cure the victims. Cure them instead of killing them.\" She grabbed his arm. \"You bastard. Why didn't you cure my Millie?\"\n\"Don't believe everything you read.\" He brushed her hand off without slowing. \"This disease ain't that easy.\"\n* * *\nAli stood in the drawing room, with its fine old furniture, and mementos of a family who filled these paneled walls no more. Dawn light filtered in through\nhalf-opened slats of white oak Venetian blinds.\nIt was a funny old house. The roof was packed with solar panels, but there was no electricity or running water.\nShe studied a picture on the wall. Quaid -- young, standing with his arm around a woman's waist. A young girl leaned against his string bean legs, half hiding her golden face from the sun\n- or the camera. Quaid and the woman were smiling, no ... laughing.\nHad there really been a time of laughter? So long many years ago. She hardly recalled.\n\"My family.\"\nAli whirled in alarm, coming face to face with Quaid.\n\"They're gone now.\" He shook his massive gray head. \"Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. Time to go. We've got a call.\"\n\"So soon?\" She'd been with Quaid a week. Cleaned up, fed, and dressed in clothes he'd produced from a dusty old trunk in the attic -- already her body had begun to fill out.\nShe had her own room at the top of the stairs. This was his house, from the times before the troubles. Guarded now by Rafe and his boys who lived in the big house down the road and seemed to owe Quaid a debt. Or vice-versa, she couldn't tell.\nA garden supplied them with fresh fruit and vegetables. People came by with bits of meat -- payoffs, which they placed just inside the gate -- too timid, or reviled, to approach any closer.\nQuaid made few demands on her, leaving her mostly to herself. The house was hers to explore, except for his bedroom and the door in the hall between the kitchen and drawing room.\nShe knew that door had something to do with the cure the old newspapers mentioned. He kept it locked, but vanished through it at least once every day.\n\"You think this is soon?\" Quaid stepped in front of the picture. \"It's the longest break I've had in a while.\"\n\"Oh ... I see.\" She pictured herself in the months ahead, rushing from body to body.\nHe started to leave, but turned back to her. \"I don't think you do see. This job is endless. Calls come anytime.\"\n\"I can handle it.\"\n\"Can you?\"\nShe righted her shoulders. \"I'm stronger than you think.\"\n\"I don't think anything. You'll do the job as long as you can stand it, then go, like all the rest. When that happens, it's okay. I don't hold any expectations.\"\n\"Damn you. You're so sure. Isn't your certainty an expectation?\"\nShe thought she saw a ghost of a smile cross his dry thick lips, but it passed before she could react to it.\n\"You're right, girl. My apologies. Shall we go?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n* * *\nThe plague had driven the old man insane. When Quaid covered his mouth and closed off his nostrils, Ali saw him smiling still, eyes shining with mad glee.\n\"No.\" Ali grabbed Quaid's hands, pulling them away -- desperation lending her strength. \"Don't take his life. You know how to heal him. Do it. Cure him.\"\nFreed, the old man leaped off the couch and hopped around the room, waving his arms, grinning and spitting at them. \"Cure me, cure me,\" he cackled like an old bantam. \"Do it, do it.\"\n\"Look at him.\" Quaid pulled away from Ali. \"He's crazy. Even if I could cure him, he'd still be a nut case. Besides, I told you I can't cure anyone.\"\n\"Then why do the old newspapers say you could? Why does everyone still believe you can?\"\n\"Those were bad times. I did try, but the cure didn't work. Folks wanted it so bad they kept believing. Even now, when there's so little real hope, everyone still believes the plague will burn itself out someday. Now, help me catch this poor old fool. Let's do our job and get the hell out of here.\"\nThe old man dodged and weaved, but they trapped him at last and laid him back on the couch. Ali sat on his legs, holding his arms at his sides. He didn't move now. When Quaid backed away, the smile stayed. Peaceful now -- even joyful.\nHis wife, also deranged by the disease, screamed when Quaid opened her door. She bucked Ali off three times before they put her down.\nThe son, a depleted man with shifty eyes, loitered downstairs in the drawing room. When they went down to him, he stood grinning, embarrassed.\n\"This was a good day for them. Most days they are in so much pain. I'm glad it was a good day.\" He handed Quaid a live chicken in a bag, promising another next month.\n\"Why do you do them that way?\" Ali asked as they left the house. \"Why suffocate them? Isn't there a better way?\"\nQuaid stopped at the gate staring at her. \"Look, I do this my way, with my own two hands. It doesn't leave a mess or a mutilated body for the bereaved to worry and cry over. Considering I have next-to-nothing to work with, I do manage to slip my patients over to the next life in as peaceful a manner as possible.\" He swung away from her.\nHalfway home a man hailed them. They followed him to Hopetown. His wife, a shriveled young woman, lay on a bed of old straw. Ali felt a pang of sadness -- the place resembled her old hut. The woman suffered great pain, though her mind was sound. The plague again, affecting each victim differently, but always the unbearable pain, the festering red welts oozing smelly yellow pus.\nThe woman had made this decision. She wanted peace -- rest from the anguish. Her husband had nursed her for three long years. They kissed, and Quaid ministered to her. Ali stood across the room hugging herself. When Quaid turned from his work, the man sobbed. They left with no payment.\nOutside, Ali slapped Quaid's face. \"You are a monster. Why didn't you cure her? She was young, she wasn't crazy.\"\n\"Told you before, I can't--\"\n\"I know. You can't cure anyone.\"\n\"Right.\" He turned and headed for home.\n\"My ass.\"\nA heavy hand gripped her shoulder, spinning her around. \"My, my. Such a foul mouth.\" Rafe scanned her up and down, sniffing. \"Why, ain't you the little changeling?\"\nAli stifled a startled scream and pulled away from him. He stepped in closer, his hand caressing her neck. His breath smelled of hooch.\n\"What do you want?\" She nodded at the receding figure down the road. \"I'm with Quaid.\" She hated having to hide behind the old man's protection.\n\"Last time we met, you looked like filthy pig skin pulled over a\nsix-inch pipe. But you clean up nice. Got some meat on you too. Keep this up an' suitors'll be swarming all over the old Doc's house trying to steal you away.\"\n\"I'm not interested in suitors.\"\n\"No? Quaid's fine by you, eh?\" He laughed, then turned serious. \"Old Doc's got secrets, and he ain't gonna last forever. Who's gonna keep the wolves off you, and his secrets, when he goes? You best be nice to me.\"\n\"I'm most definitely not interested in you.\" She wrenched away from him, standing her ground.\n\"Hey, I'm a little soused right now, but give it time, little one. I'm a lot more presentable when I sober up. Give it time.\" He shuffled off toward Hopetown, snickering to himself and twirling his shotgun.\nShe spat after him and ran to catch up with Quaid.\n* * *\nAli heaved several carrots out of the ground and stumbled for the back door. She was fitter now after weeks of food and exercise. In the kitchen, she dumped the load of vegetables in the sink and lit the alcohol lamp against the growing darkness. Wiping her brow, she started back out to bring in water from the well. But something stopped her.\nTiptoeing down the hall she found the door standing open. Quaid must've gone down there again, as he did at least once a day. But this time he left it open.\nShe fingered the handle, deciding ... then light-footed it down the stairs. A second door stood ajar at the bottom. Beyond that was a well-lit basement. Quaid had stuffed one corner with lab equipment and cages full of white rats. Cool air hissed out of vents in the ceiling.\nA\nlife-size picture of someone's living room covered the wall opposite. No ... that was glass! The room existed behind it. The solar panels on the roof must supply the power for this. That's why nothing was left for the rest of the house.\nA transparent cubicle was attached to the center of the glass wall. Ali peered in. A single chair faced two holes, which opened into the room beyond. A pair of thick rubber gloves sealed the holes. Quaid could stick his hands in and work on the other side without coming in contact with whoever, or whatever lived there. Hypos, a centrifuge, and several other medical instruments filled a shelf on the other side, along with two empty cages and a decontamination airlock with a sliding shelf, so small items could be slid in.\n\"My God,\" she whispered. \"He's got someone locked in there.\"\n\"Help me.\" The moan came from the opposite side of the cubicle.\nAli found Quaid on the floor -- his face deathly white. Small red pustules erupted yellow goo as she watched. His body writhed in agony, arms and legs cramped and stiff. She'd seen this before. The plague. Quaid had it bad.\n\"Why didn't you tell me.\" She fell to her knees, but kept her hands to herself, knowing any touch would just bring more agony to him.\n\"Didn't want anyone to know,\" he hissed through clenched teeth. \"Bad for business.\"\n\"Oh God. How long?\"\n\"Four years.\"\n\"Four years? How the hell did you keep it a secret? Someone must have found out. Someone who came to ask for your help must have seen you like this sometime.\"\n\"Rafe. When it's bad he won't let anyone close. My mind's okay -- just this pain once in a while.\" He grinned. \"A mild case.\"\n\"Why didn't you take the easy way out, like your patients?\"\nQuaid convulsed as another voice answered.\n\"He wouldn't abandon the people in Hopetown.\"\nAli's head jerked up. A woman stood in the room beyond, hands pressed against\nthe glass.\n\"Who are you?\"\nThe woman stared at Quaid, tears filling her eyes. \"His daughter.\"\nAli flashed on the picture upstairs, the little girl hugging young Quaid's leg.\nThe woman's eyes flicked to her and bored in. \"Helena.\"\n\"What do you want, Helena?\"\n\"It's bad this time. Real bad. It's been getting worse the last few months. He can't go on anymore. You must release him.\"\n\"Release him? God! You mean kill him, don't you? Murder him, like he's been doing to others. I can't do that.\"\n\"You've been helping him.\"\n\"Only because I thought he had a cure, I wanted to find it, give it to the world. I never took a life myself -- it was always him.\"\nQuaid moaned and rolled into a tight ball, whimpering.\nHelena's eyes took him in, then fixed themselves back on Ali. \"He did what he had to do. What you have to do now, for him. There is a cure. It's me. You must take over for him.\"\nRafe burst in from the stairwell and knelt beside Quaid. He checked the old man's pulse, turning his head to study the red pustules. He shook his head to Helena. \"It's bad.\"\n\"I know.\" Helena faced away.\nRafe glared at Ali. \"She told you?\"\n\"Some. I'm suppose to put him out of his misery -- take over his job.\"\n\"It won't be easy. People hate him for what he does. When he killed my parents I hated him too -- until I found out.\" He flicked a look at Helena. \"They'll hate you too.\"\n\"Me? Why not you? You're the law around here.\"\n\"Folks wouldn't trust me if I did the Doc's work. People gotta trust the law. Some folks don't like it that I support Doc, and I drink too much sometimes. I never hurt anyone though, even if they\nbreak the law. Him, they hate and fear, but they need his help ... or someone like him.\"\nAli whirled to Helena. \"You then ... you're his daughter.\"\nHelena turned and rapped on the glass, a deep, rich thud. \"I can't leave. I may have the cure in my blood, but it's not ready yet. If I came out now it'd start a whole new epidemic, even among the immunes. There'd be no one left.\"\n\"When? When can you come out?\"\nShe shook her head. \"The virus has to mutate in the right direction. It's a gamble. It could happen tomorrow ... or never.\"\n\"How will you know?\"\nHelena nodded at the small, attached cubicle. \"Father passes two of those rats in here -- one recently infected, the other immune -- and injects them with my blood. If they both survive, I'm out.\"\nAli's gaze drifted. \"We could make a serum from your blood. Inoculate sufferers. Make more serum from their blood. Shit, we could wipe out this damn plague.\"\n\"Whoa. The virus has to mutate correctly first. We have no control over that. It changes constantly -- we only hope that someday it'll change the way we want it to.\"\n\"Okay, it's just a hope.

Snider \u00a9 2000\nEditor's Note: This story is\nthe result of an experiment in which I hoped\nto create a \"hard science fiction\" story that\nevoked pure emotion in the reader. I\nsubmitted it for a short story contest, but\nthe story was not accepted. Enjoy!\nI\ndrove my kid sister to Kennedy yesterday.\nIt was a cool Florida spring, so we drove with the windows down.\nI could smell the ocean. Kathy\nlooked silently out the passenger window, cupping her right hand against the\nbuffeting wind, gazing at the fluffy clouds that crawled across the early\nmorning sky. This was the last time she would see the clouds of Earth.\nAs\nwe drove up to the gate, gravel hissing under the tires, I could see one of the\nnew shuttles sitting on the runway. The\nExpress, they call it. Soon it\nwould take her up to the orbiting starship, bound for Alpha Centauri.\n#\nI was two years older than Kathy, but she was smarter \u2013 much smarter.\nI was no slouch, mind you, but Kathy came along right behind me, trumping\nevery accomplishment with ease. I\nwas on the Dean\u2019s list; she got a 4.0. I\nwas All-State in baseball; she pitched in the State Championship.\nI resented her bitterly, and was petty and cruel to her when we were\nkids. But, as we grew up, I saw\nthat she persevered with an innocent grace I found impossible to hate.\nShe never put on airs, never touted herself above others, never\ndownplayed my accomplishments. As a matter of fact, she was often embarrassed for me at how\npeople fawned over her. She went\nout of her way to include my victories in dinnertime conversation, or among her\nfriends. Eventually I realized that\nI had inherited the same fine traits she had \u2013 intelligence, wit, athleticism\n\u2013 but she truly had the best qualities of both our parents.\nSuch a rare gift of genius that I made up my mind never to be jealous of\nher again.\nAfter that it was great between us.\nI grew prouder of her than if she had been my own child, rather than my\nlittle sister. When\nshe graduated from high school she really went into overdrive.\nMIT and Berkeley on scholarships.\nTwo doctorates. Research\ngrants. Patents.\nThen her years in orbit and on the Moon.\nMy\nkid sister! Funny\nhow I still thought of her that way, though we had both advanced well into\nmiddle age.\nBut always, through the grown-up years, regardless of how busy she was,\nshe would keep in touch, come see us when she could.\nKathy never had time for a family of her own. So, I had the life she never allowed for herself.\nI had a wonderful marriage, a successful career, kids \u2013 boy, the kids\nwere crazy for Sis. We saw each other once a year or so, usually for only a day\nat a time, but it was great. She\nwas so alive, so bright, so ambitious - and so happy.\nIt hurt every time she left, especially after Mom and Dad passed away,\nbut every time I knew there would be a next time. Maybe a year, maybe two, but always a next time.\nEven the Moon wasn\u2019t too far away for her to come back once in a while.\nIn between visits, I would see her on TV or in a magazine, but then it\nwas the world\u2019s Dr. Katherine Grey, not my Kathy.\nNothing could substitute for the times we were together. We would talk, just the two of us, early in the morning, over\ncoffee, while everyone else was still asleep.\nShe\u2019d catch up on what the kids were doing, or how my work was going.\nAnd I\u2019d hear all about her adventures and her research.\nHalf the time I didn\u2019t know what the hell she was talking about, but I\njust nodded my head and was glad for her.\nThen, finally, she was selected. My\nSis would be one of 250 people who would travel to Alpha Centauri to form the\nfirst colony there. Kathy says\nit\u2019s 4.3 light years away. Twenty-five\nmillion million miles. No chance,\never, for another goodbye.\n#\nKathy\nflashed a badge to the guards, and we drove slowly up to a low, colorless\ndormitory. Neither one of us spoke.\nI parked, and we got out. She\ndidn\u2019t have any luggage \u2013 only a small case with some family items I\u2019d\ncollected for her.\n\u201cWell...\u201d\nshe said, smiling nervously.\n\u201cWell...\u201d\nI echoed, and then we hugged each other desperately. I patted her shoulders with one hand, fighting back tears.\nAfter a few seconds we held each other out at arm\u2019s length.\n\u201cYou\ntake care,\u201d was all I could muster.\n\u201cYou\ntoo, Jimmy,\u201d she said hoarsely. Her\neyes were red; the corners of her mouth turned down. Neither of us had the courage to say much beyond that.\nAbruptly,\nshe turned on her heel and headed for the dorm. At the entry, she spun back toward me, raising one small\nhand, palm forward as she took the last few steps backward. I returned the gesture, and then she was gone.\nOff into the hands of waiting technicians, where she would be dressed in\na jumpsuit and given one final medical check.\n#\nThe\nnew shuttles could take off from almost any runway, but the bureaucrats had\ndecided to do it at the Cape, for old times\u2019 sake. Grandstands had been erected so select officials, the press,\nand family members could observe the launch.\nIt was going to be one of the biggest media events in history.\nKathy had gotten me a ticket, but I\u2019d decided some time ago not to use\nit.

Scott Russell, Science Fiction Short Story","author":null,"hostname":null,"date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000","categories":"","tags":"","id":null,"license":null,"comments":null,"text":"|\n|\nDecember\n2000\nOne\nStarry Night\nby and \u00a9\nR. Scott Russell\nImage\nfrom nineplanets.org\nStars within stars within stars.\nDr. Swan Donalson was counting stars through a break in the clouds when she missed the turn onto the snowy lane that led to her parents' house. She reacted by slamming on the Rover's brakes. The Rover fish-tailed more than any salesman back in Southern California would have cared to advertise. The Rover made three rotations across ice-covered roadway and then slid into a\nsnow bank. After a moment of stunned reflection Swan put the transmission into reverse. The wheels spun plaintively and the vehicle lurched to the right. The Rover was now at least a foot deeper in the white muck. Swan momentarily wondered if the snow bank was bottomless.\nSwan rested her head against the steering wheel and turned off the engine. No sense adding suffocation to the list of tonight's troubles. She glanced at her watch: eleven-thirty PM.\nMerry Christmas. Well, almost.\nSwan switched off the headlights. Snowflakes glittered in the dying beams before being engulfed by the deep shadows of the surrounding pines. Swan opened the door. Cold bit her face. It was enough to take the breath away from someone who called herself a California girl. She shivered.\nGet used to it, a little voice chided, it's at least two miles to Mom and Dad's.\nShe stomped the large boots she had bought at a local-but-trendy sporting goods store. That had been with her first paycheck as Associate Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Oswego College. She had purchased a jacket there, too. The little booklet that came with the jacket had made the impressive claim that all the materials in the jacket had been slope tested on Denali. But could they survive a night in Northern New York?\nShe zipped up the jacket and felt suddenly warmer. She laughed and confidence sparked within her. Those two miles would pass pretty quickly.\nFer sure.\nShe was about to slam the door when her eyes fell upon the manila envelope that rested on the passenger's seat. All that Swan had brought from Stanford to tiny Oswego resided in that envelope. The images of the emission nebulae were a product of her clout and her investigator's allotment on the Hubble Space Telescope. Before her arrival, the Oswego group had spent years submitting proposals for investigation on HST. All had been rejected. It was only with her name on the list of co-investigator's that Oswego's huddle of astronomers had gotten their first crack at the orbiting telescope.\nAs of today that effort had been deemed a failure.\nFuming, Swan stuffed the envelope into a small satchel, zipped the leather case closed, then locked and slammed the door. She still couldn't get the faces of the investigator team out of her mind. Anger. Anger as if she were somehow responsible for the poor images beamed up from the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. She knew that bastard Dr. Frost was a backstabbing SOB, a barracuda among the fish in this little pond. If Frost wanted he could force her to lose her position while keeping the group's HST time alive. Now that Oswego's project had time scheduled with Hubble the group could continue for years with or without her.\nThanks a bundle, baby.\nCrunch, crunch, crunch...The clinging snow demanded her attention as she walked. It had been a long time since she had traversed a snow-covered road, field, sidewalk, anything for that\nmatter...crunch, crunch, crunch.\nThe snow-sound had once been so familiar yet it now echoed with an odd nostalgia. She had grown up amid these snowy lanes and this place had been her entire world. But at 18, college swept her to the West Coast. Life and work had conspired to keep her there and she had never really looked back. Until the divorce. Then one rainy day it occurred to her that twenty-two years was a long time to be away from home. She wondered if she would feel a similar nostalgia for Steve twenty-two years from now. Hmmm...probably not. Anger simmered. Goodbye to her old life and everything else that bitch from Cupertino had stolen!\nShe sighed heavily and the exhalation gusted gray around her. For a moment the fog about her head had the same hues as a nebula seen through a backyard telescope. The snow under her feet added a coldness that her imagination told her was the texture of deep space. She smiled. Childhood memories bounded. It was on a night like this that she had pointed her first telescope skyward. How old had she been...eleven, twelve?\nThe box her father had presented to her was long and deep. The wrapping paper was a royal blue over which three tiny magi rode toward a spike-tailed star. Without hesitation Swan ripped and tore the paper apart. A second's beat later revealed a package beneath the crumpled wrap. Her parents were librarians at Oswego College and this gift had consumed most of their Christmas budget. They watched their daughter open the gift with looks of bemused apprehension. Would their little girl like this thing they had given her?\n\"A telescope!\" Swan finally breathed.\n\"It's like the ones in those magazines you're always looking at,\" Dad said.\n\"A small one. A starter-scope. Just your size,\" Mom said.\nA wide, toothy grin spread across Swan's face. When she spoke her tone was reverent, \"A refractor! I bet I can finish my Messier List with it!\"\nBehind his beard her father blinked as he always did whenever he was perplexed. \"Oh sure. Your Mez...your list.\"\n\"When I'm done with the List the Astronomical League will send me a certificate,\" Swan said gleefully.\n\"She's been filling out a log, Edward,\" her mother said.\nSwan nodded. \"Mom's been helping me fill it out.\" Swan had once told Mr. Byrne, her science teacher, about the List but he hadn't seemed interested in her extracurricular activity. That had left Mom.\nSwan thought about her parents and smiled. Mom and Dad were retired and living in Florida, now. Their move and her divorce had happened at nearly the same time. She had gotten the little farmhouse at what she knew to be a bargain basement price. The spot where she had set up that first telescope was now overgrown with blackberry thickets. Odd how after becoming a professional astronomer she rarely touched a scope. Computer analysis and number crunching had been the foundation of her PhD.\nSwan waded through a snowdrift. A gust of wind sent a swirl of flakes past her. The Tug Hill region of western New York was infamous for its lake effect snow. Wet, moist air from Lake Ontario rose and mingled with frigid air masses moving south from Canada. The effect could be devastating. Several feet of snow could pile up in a matter of hours.\nUntil this moment Swan hadn't thought much about snow squalls. Berkeley offered its worries but snow squalls weren't among them. Should she have left the Rover? She glanced warily skyward and gasped.\nThere were no clouds to be seen. A steady wind had pushed away the storm cell that had chosen to dump a foot of snow on Oswego County that afternoon. Now the sky was full of wonders. Sirius burned arrogantly, calling all who sought the music of the spheres to pause and listen to its song. Rigel and Betelgeuse stood opposite one another like the heraldic ensigns of lost foes. The Pleiades reminded her of a diamond pin her grandmother once wore. The great square of Pegasus always made her think of Narnia. And Ursa Major, her oldest friend in these skies, made her smile.\nThen she remembered her constellation and sought the western horizon.\nAs a child she had learned that Cygnus meant Swan. Thus she had given that constellation her utmost attention. Deneb, Sadr, Gienah, and Albireo stood low on the western horizon. Ancient Arabians had given the stars of Cygnus their names. She knew that the three main stars were all red giants. These were dozens of times bigger than the sun. Swan stared and felt a tingle of wonder.\nOn that special Christmas Eve long ago Swan had turned her new telescope toward Cygnus and its mysteries. Special clouds of dust hovered around Cygnus. Swan knew that two of these clouds were on her Messier List. The List was a catalog of 110 deep space objects such as clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Charles Messier was an 18th century French astronomer who had first cataloged these bodies. The telescope had helped her capture these objects and ultimately earn her the certificate. Her mother had framed it and hung it on the living room wall. It still resided with her parents in the condo in Titusville.\nSwan passed a large oak and realized that she only had another mile to go. The bare branches of the ancient tree reached upward, grasping the fabric of the night sky and the diamond swan that flew through heaven. The bird laughed and flew on, unencumbered. The image made Swan smile. It was as if that constellation had somehow followed her back here, back home.\nSwan continued walking but her mind focused less on the road and more on the Hubble images. It was ironic that the images she carried in the satchel were of the Veil Nebula in Cygnus. When she first spotted it through that old scope she knew nothing about emission nebula. Now, she knew everything about them.\nOr not enough, according to Frost's committee.\nEmission nebulae were a subclass of gaseous clouds that existed close to a hot star. Photons from the star excited or ionized the gas clouds. The ionization created bright spectral patterns. Such nebulae were not a new field of study, but what Hubble was showing them of the Veil Nebula was totally unexpected. The long filaments that made up the nebula were speckled and broken. Indeed, the Veil itself, or what they could see of it amid the annoying flecks, was contorted and twisted beyond anything that they had thought possible!\nExplain this! Frost had demanded. Something was there that shouldn't be. Had she chosen the wrong filters? Fed the controllers the wrong coordinates? Why were the images so splotchy? She had fielded these questions as best she could. She was certain she hadn't made any mistakes.\n\"Maybe some type of equipment failure?\" Old Prof Van Rijn had suggested. Frost would have none of it. True, he had pontificated, the last time anyone had imaged the Veil was before Hubble's mirror aberration had been corrected. But even taking that into account the new Veil images didn't look anything like those old ones. Something was seriously wrong.\nA grin crossed her face. For all of HST's wonders she had fonder feelings toward her old scope. That old scope was...what was the California term?\nPure.\nEverything seemed pure on a night like this. The air, the stars, her being. Beneath her feet the snow seemed steady and solid. Indeed, it was a veritable presence. It sealed her return, transforming it from mere arrival to certain belonging. She belonged here, she decided. She belonged at the college. Her stride quickened and the satchel felt lighter. She'd get through this thing with the HST images. She had solved bigger mysteries, hadn't she? .\nThe gloved hand that was holding the satchel was getting cold. She switched the satchel over to her left hand and shoved the other into the thick folds of a pocket. That was better. The cleansing coldness of this place always amazed her. She remembered her first night observing with that old telescope. The night had been frigid. Dressed in boots, a nightgown, woolen hat, and cloth overcoat she had stood shivering in the yard, setting the refractor up on its tripod.\nWhen all seemed ready she pulled an eyepiece from her pocket and slid it carefully into the vertical tube at the back of the refractor. She aligned the star Deneb in the viewfinder and then, holding her breath, gingerly lowered her eye toward the tiny circle of glass. And gasped! This was like nothing in the books and magazines she had read! Deneb was surrounded by quivering rainbows! Awestruck, Swan pulled her eye away from the reticle and stared at Cygnus. What was going on? None of the stars in the books ever looked that way! Was it a nova, or a nebula, or some unknown cosmic tangle of matter?\n\"Rainbows,\" Swan had declared proudly.\nThe rainbows were Dr. Swan Donalson's first astronomical discovery. It was short lived. Swan moved her mitten to the little wheel at the base of the eyepiece. When she turned it slowly the rainbows around Deneb congealed and faded. Swan was left looking at an intense point of quivering light. No form, no structure, just a burning presence.\n\"The rainbows are gone!\" Swan had called to the empty pines and snow that surrounded her.\nSwan turned the knob until the rainbows returned, then turned the wheel again until Deneb shone as a crisp pinpoint. The vision of that spark held her in thrall. She knew stars were very far away. What amazed her was that her telescope could bring them no closer. It was a very personal measure of how vast the universe was. She and the telescope were standing under the arch of the Milky Way, like two bystanders on the edge of a starry lane.\n\"The rainbows meant the focus was wrong,\" Swan whispered to the heavens.\nWhen Swan saw lights around the bend of trees she knew she was nearing the house. A gust of wind lifted icy crystals from a snowdrift and hurled them toward her eyes. She squinted to avoid the stinging particles. Her vision blurred and she staggered slightly. The wind roared and she stopped in mid-stride, putting an arm over her face. The whipping snow was like an angry swarm of insects, biting her neck and face. The satchel dropped to the ground and became a lopsided rectangle rising out of the snow.\nA swarm? Bugs?\nThe roaring gale passed as quickly as it came. Swan stooped down to collect the satchel. Her vision was watery but returning. What if something like this had happened to Hubble's instrumentation? Could particles impacting the mirror cause some new type of aberration? Swan closed her eyes and gripped the satchel. No, the HST team down in Baltimore would have been alerted by something as gross as physical damage to the mirror.\nAs Swan rose to her feet the question persisted. What if the Veil's distortion had been caused by something else? Something common to the space environment, yet easily overlooked?\nn instant later she knew the answer. \"Cosmic rays caused those flecks. A swarm of cosmic rays.\"\nSwan gusted a sigh. That suggestion made more sense than anything that had been bandied around the Physics Department's conference room earlier that evening. Cosmic rays were high-energy particles. If they had impacted the Hubble's CCD imaging array then the excess charge transferred to the pixels could account for the strange flecks and distortion. The images could be cleaned up with the proper software.\nShe hurried toward the house. Once inside she turned on several lights and started a fire. Then, still feeling chilled, she put on a pot of water for some hot chocolate. While she waited for the water to boil she opened her satchel and fished out the photos.\n\"What a mess!\" she breathed. \"Just like the rainbows.\" With trembling hands she spread the half dozen photos across the oak table and stared.\nSwan put in a call to the HST center in Baltimore. Somehow she scared up a grad student in the imaging department. He was very courteous and eager to please and was quick to access the Oswego team's files. A little digital correction and the images were appearing on Swan's home computer. As the sun rose on a beautiful Christmas morning Swan couldn't resist printing them out on the LaserJet. All of the glossies showed the Veil Nebula as intertwined filaments of ionized gas. The Hubble's amazing resolving power revealed delicate strands of incredible complexity spread across an immense distance of space. These images were the best she had ever seen. As if by magic the cosmic ray specks had all disappeared!\nThey had been cleared away like rainbows around a distant star.\nEND\n|\n|\nWhen he's not writing, R.\nScott Russell runs a test lab where he is allowed to break things for\na living.

Snider \u00a9 2010\nI was asked by INsite Atlanta magazine (\u201cAtlanta\u2019s Leading Entertainment Publication\u201d) to contribute to their special \u201cDecade in Review\u201d issue.

Banks imagines a hard-hitting, multifaceted multiverse overseen by The Concern.\nReview by Carlos Aranaga \u00a9 2010\nAssassins, torture, sex, drugs and hot pursuit by alternate world agents through Venetian canals and piazzas mark Iain M. Banks\u2019 new novel, Transition (pub. by Orbit, Sep 2009, 416 pp hdcvr, $25.99), as an arresting thriller bridging Banks\u2019 own parallel world personae as a veteran sci-fi writer and author of literary fiction. A complex, riotous work, told via the eyes of six main characters, Transition is set in our present, and flits through sheaves of parallel worlds, some nearly identical to ours, perched at the end of a 20-year pregnant pause in history, bracketed by the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall and the 2008 fall of Wall Street, and buttressed mid-span by the fall of the Twin Towers.\nRead the rest of this entry \u00bb\nDefinition of Science FictionDecember 13th, 2009\nCheck out this quick interview I did for the website Sci-Fi.LoveToKnow.com. Titled \u201cDefinition of Science Fiction,\u201d we discuss the evolution, current state, and possible future of the genre. Thanks to Ryan Dube for a fun conversation!\nHitler\u2019s WarDecember 12th, 2009\nHarry Turtledove reinvents World War II with the kick-off of a new alt-history epic.\nReview by Carlos Aranaga \u00a9 2009\nFew questions enthrall minds of a speculative bent more than that of \u201cWhat if?\u201d Alternate history plumbs the depths of the multiverse, replay after replay, the die of human events recast time and again. This game has no greater exponent than the seasoned, prolific story-teller Harry Turtledove. If alternate history was written up in the Wall Street Journal, Turtledove\u2019s visage would adorn the article.\nComing off his creditable 2008 stand-alone alt-history novel, The Man with the Iron Heart, which imagined a post-World War II Nazi resistance paralleling the current-day Iraqi insurgency, Turtledove\u2019s Hitler\u2019s War (pub. by Del Rey, Aug 2009, 512 pp hdcvr, $27) imagines what could have happened had Chamberlain not caved to the Nazis at Munich in 1938. Add to it the assassination by a Czech nationalist of Hitler\u2019s real-life Sudetenland stooge Konrad Henlein and Europe bursts into continental war a year ahead of schedule.\nRead the rest of this entry \u00bb\nWin a copy of Draw Star Wars: The Clone WarsNovember 13th, 2009\nCongratulations to Angela Winesburg, Israel Yeres, Pat Connors, Jake Lsewhere, and Aaron Habel!\nWin one of five copies of Draw Star Wars: The Clone Wars!
