Made it legal, too.\nClara\nFraser had two things in her own blood: a love of her native\nSacramento and Benjamin Claver. Departing one with the other\nmade it no easier, nor did the ring around her finger.\nHe\nwooed her with the idea of Colorado in general and Cripple\nCreek specifically. How anything with cripple in its name\ncould be appealing escaped Clara, but she listened as Benjamin\nspoke of the mountains and the gold within.\nHe\nspoke of Rose Bud Hill and she pictured a mountain of tangled\nvines and blooms, soft summer winds blowing that wild scent\ndown into the town. He spoke of Raven Hill and she thrilled\nat the thought of a million black birds taking flight. Ironclad\nHill made Clara's face wrinkle, so Benjamin changed the subject\nto Gold Hill, and the Bogart-Blue Flag Mine.\nEverything\nhad a fanciful name. Half Moon Shaft, Black Jack, Blue Bell,\nRed Bird. Gold Geyser, Independence, Comstock, Three Kinds.\nBenjamin's map of the mining district looked like nonsense\nto Clara, uneven shapes tossed over mountainsides. One mine\noverlapped another; how did they keep all the gold straight?\nBenjamin\nkissed Clara's nose and she snuggled into his arms, awaiting\nthe moment when Cripple Creek lay before them. And when it\ndid, Clara's face wrinkled again. Benjamin tried not to notice,\nbut couldn't help it. Didn't the scene before them fire her\nwith the same passion it did him? Couldn't she see the potential?\nUnder the bleak land lay a shining bounty. Sacramento would\nbe small compared to the gold found here.\nRose\nBud Hill was not bursting with vines and blooms. It looked\nmuch like any other hill in the region, bleak in the cold\nspring, still speckled with patches of snow. Cripple Creek\nitself was shades of gray and brown; Clara ached for the color\nand scent of the coast, but straightened her back as she entered\nher home. Benjamin's arm stopped her. Without a word, he swept\nher from her feet, bags and all, and carried her inside.\n\"Our\nfirst home, Mrs. Claver,\" he said as he pressed her against\nthe nearest wall. He rocked a kiss over her sweet mouth and\ntook the bags from her hands. \"Only the first, because\njust you wait, you'll be living in a place finer than the\none your folks keep. I aim to be rich, Mrs. Claver, and will\nkeep you in nothing but furs when I am.\"\nClara's\ncheeks pinked. \"Even in summer?\"\nThe\nbags hit the floor with a solid thud. \"In summer, you\nrun naked.\"\nNaked\nwas the last thing Clara wanted to be in a house that needed\na good airing and dusting. She hurried Benjamin along with\ntheir bags, touching the furniture that had been left for\nthem. There wasn't much, and upstairs there was even less.\nThe bed had a definite squeak.\n\"We'll\nneed a bureau,\" Clara said, but before she could list\nmore, Benjamin touched a switch on the wall. Light flooded\nthe room, astonishing electric light. \"Light!\"\nBenjamin\nsmiled the very smile that had captured her heart on their\nfirst meeting, despite the fact that he'd been waist-deep\nin the ocean, trying to dislodge a grounded boat. \"Cripple\nCreek ain't no hole, I told you that. You can do your sewing\nat night if you like.\"\nAnd\nClara liked the idea of that very much. She was hopeful of\nfinding a local quilting bee, but first, a bureau, for she\nwasn't about to live out of her bags.\nHarben's\nGeneral Store had a little bit of everything, she discovered\nthe following day. Be it beans or furniture, Harben had it,\nand liked to talk at length about how he was the only one\nin town who did have it.\nClara\nleft Benjamin with Harben, slipping away as the man went on\nabout the variety of spices he stocked, and proceeded to show\nBenjamin each and every one. Clara went to the furniture,\nran her hands over the smoothed wood, and found exactly what\nshe was looking for when she rounded a rocking chair. The\nbureau was nothing fancy, but had seven drawers and was as\nwide as two doorways. It was soft gold in color, smooth and\nwithout splinters, and the drawers were nicely made.\nShe\npulled each one out to test them, and only the bottom one\nstuck. Clara kneeled on the floor and gave it a harder tug.\nIt came open and a small fabric pouch made itself known. Its\nlaces had tangled under the drawer above it, for now the drawer\nslid back and forth smoothly.\nThe\npouch seemed warm in Clara's hand. She cradled it as she might\nan egg, and her hand tingled. She dropped it when Benjamin's\nvoice sounded near.\n\"Clara?\"\nHe\ncame around the corner and found her kneeling there, closing\nthe drawer. Clara smiled and hooked a thumb at the bureau.\n\"I think this one will do us fine.\"\nBenjamin\nClaver knew better than to argue with Clara, fearing that\nshe would say she couldn't stand Cripple Creek and was heading\nhome. He paid for the bureau and Harben's sons loaded it into\nthe wagon. The boys even saw them home with it and carried\nit upstairs, where it fit lengthwise through the bedroom door\nand neatly against the western wall.\nClara\ndraped the top with the strip of fabric her mother had sent\nalong and set up the picture of her parents as well. Benjamin\nlay the frame face down, for he couldn't stomach the idea\nof her parents watching him make love to his wife. Which he\nplanned to often, squeaky bed or no.\nThey\nhad four days in their new home before Benjamin had to meet\nMr. Root at the Half Moon Shaft. Clara didn't want Benjamin\nto go, but at the same time couldn't deny him his passion\nfor gold.\nShe\ndidn't like the idea of him underground, for what if the walls\ndidn't hold and the ground, so heavy with its gold, simply\ncollapsed. She tried not to let such thoughts show, but Benjamin\nsaw. He tenderly kissed her and held her before he left that\nmorning. Just in case something did happen, he thought. But\nit wouldn't. It couldn't. Cripple Creek held their luck, this\nhe knew.\nClara,\nrather than sit home and worry about the ground smothering\nher husband, decided to explore Cripple Creek on her own.\nIt was, initially, a poor decision, for as she walked the\nstreets, men called to her, offering her coin for her company.\nHer cheeks burned with color, but that only encouraged them,\nfor what man didn't like a bashful lass?\nRefuge\nwas found at Mrs. Bunn's house, where Clara discovered the\nCripple Creek Pin Wielders Society, and was welcomed with\nopen arms and a flip. The mixture of beer, rum, and sugar\nwarmed Clara and she found herself smiling at even the simplest\nof needlework the ladies showed her.\n\"Clara\nClaver in Cripple Creek--ain't that the sweetest thing ever?\"\nClara\nsmiled pleasantly at the overly thin and pale Mrs. Irving,\nand stretched her legs under the quilt the ladies were working\non. She had long-since abandoned her shoes, bid by Mrs. Bunn\nto do so. \"It is sweet,\" Clara allowed. \"I\nreckon it'll be the perfect place for me. Though I do miss\nSacramento.\"\n\"Such\nan adventure!\" Mrs. Singleton exclaimed and pricked her\nfinger as she misjudged her stitching. She suckled the finger\nand shook her head. \"I can't imagine packing up and moving\nlike that,\" she said once she removed the bleeding digit.\n\"My family was raised in these hills--how could you leave\na perfectly good life to come here?\"\n\"Life\nisn't perfectly good here?\" Clara asked and Mrs. Raglin\ngave Mrs. Singleton an elbow in the ribs before she could\nrespond.\nMrs.\nRaglin smiled at Clara. \"Perfectly good, if you like\nyour man having a mistress.\" Clara's eyes widened. \"A\nmistress who leaves him filthy and smelling of metal, one\nwho pulls her down into her womb on a daily basis and only\nspits him back out if you're lucky.\"\nAs\nMrs. Raglin turned her attention toward her drink, Miss Easten\nwhispered in Clara's ear. \"Widowed not even a month.\nLost her man in the Tenderfoot. Ground gave way and swallowed\nhim up.\"\nClara\ndrank more of her flip and thought of Benjamin. Dirty, smelling\nof metal, vanishing under a sudden slide of dirt. \"Surely\nthat doesn't happen often...\" She'd rather have him smelly\nthan swallowed.\nMiss\nEasten shrugged. \"What do you consider often?\"\n\"Accidents\nhappen everywhere,\" Mrs. Bunn said and handed Clara a\nquilt square. \"The Half Moon is supposed to be very safe.\nWant to work on this piece, dear?\"\nClara\nrushed home that evening, distraught to find the house empty\nwhen she arrived. Though Mrs. Bunn was welcoming and kind,\nClara hadn't missed the look on her face when she spoke of\nthe Half Moon Shaft being safe. What was safe in such a profession?\nHow could any miner truly be safe?\nWhen\nBenjamin arrived home, Clara had dinner on the table, but\nwas in no mood to eat. Instead she watched him, and later\nhelped him into a hot bath and scrubbed his back. She couldn't\nstop touching him, and it didn't bother Benjamin one bit.\nIf this was how Clara greeted him every day, as though she\ncouldn't get enough of him, he would be a happy man.\nBut\nclearly she wasn't a happy woman, for she cried when they\nmade love and clutched him afterward as though she feared\nhe would vanish. Benjamin rocked her in his arms and the bed\nsqueaked this way and that.\nClara\nwoke alone, Benjamin gone before sunrise. She rose and tidied\nherself before straightening the bed sheets. There were still\nbags to unpack and Clara focused on that, trying not to think\nof Benjamin in the mine, but each time she handled his shirts,\nand especially the clothes he'd worn the day before, she was\nreminded.\nHis\nclothes smelled of metal and deep earth, of a ground she had\nnever smelled before, so deep it was. Clara pressed the filthy\nshirt against her nose and breathed deeply.\nShe\nwas folding shirts into the bottom drawer when she spied the\nfabric pouch. She picked it up and again it was warm in her\nhand. Squeezing the pouch produced a small rumble from it.\nIt felt as though it contained dirt, but how could dirt stay\nwarm? The fabric was very worn, but Clara couldn't see through\nit. She was hesitant to open it, especially when she found\nthe writing on the opposite side.\n\"Half\nMoon Shaft,\" she read.\nShe\nhad no right to go looking inside it, but her fingers were\nloosening the strings even as she thought about not doing\nso. Just a bit, she told herself.\nShe\npoked one finger inside to open the pouch and felt the dirt\ninside. Not just dirt, because it was warm. Warm like skin,\nor bath water. Warm like the inside of Benjamin's mouth when\nshe dared to slip her tongue inside.\nHer\nhead grew light, so light she feared she might topple over.\nThe bed squeaked as Clara fell upon it and blackness swept\nher away. She walked on a crystalline path with an impossibly\ntall and dark man beside her. He was so thin he nearly vanished\nwhen she looked sideways at him.\n\"Where\nam I?\" she asked, but the man placed a long dark finger\nagainst her mouth.\n\"Find\nme,\" he said and his desperate need stabbed Clara much\nas a needle stabbed fabric.\nThe\npouch tumbled out of Clara's hand and she woke to the late\nafternoon heat that filled the bedroom. She lifted the pouch\nby its strings and tossed it in the drawer.\nDinner,\nshe told herself as the memory of the pouch's warmth grew\ndim. Perhaps Benjamin would enjoy a pie, or gingersnaps. Yes,\ngingersnaps. But later as she worked the dough, she thought\nof the pouch and the warmth it contained\nWhile\nClara made gingersnaps, Benjamin felt like a kid let loose\nin a candy store. The Half Moon Shaft was sweet to him, though\nit was dark and dirty. In the dank, he could smell gold and\nthough he hadn't seen any over the two days he'd been there,\nhe knew it was close. Mr. Root felt it too. They were due\nto hit a new vein.\nIt\nwas Chester who let loose the first cry. Gold, gold, he'd\nfound it. Benjamin added his arms to the fray and when his\nfingers fell upon the unearthed treasure, he let out a whoop\nwhich was lost amid the others. He drew one small nugget toward\nhim and even in the dim light, it looked like a promising\nfuture.\nDidn't\nmatter who he was hugging, or who was hugging him. Men was\nmen down there and they were all working toward a singular\ndestination. By the time Benjamin came out of the shaft, he\nfelt as though he were being reborn. Out of dankness, into\ncandle-lighting. He shoved the small nugget into his pocket,\ncertain Root wouldn't mind, and hurried home, to the scent\nof roasted chicken and fresh gingersnaps.\nBenjamin\nappreciated the meal, indeed, but it was the desert he looked\nmost forward to. In the dark of their room, Benjamin showed\nClara the gold nugget. She gasped softly as Benjamin ran it\nover her lips, down her chin, and between her collarbones.\nIt felt warm, she thought as she closed her eyes. From being\nin his pocket, that was all. Not like that pouch, not like\nthat pouch at all...\n\"Gold\nsparkles on your nose,\" Benjamin whispered and kissed\nthe sparkles away.\nBenjamin\nand his nugget were gone again come morning. It was a routine\nClara didn't immediately like but eventually came to appreciate.\nShe was fortunate, she told herself. Benjamin placed no restrictions\nupon her. She didn't cook dinner solely for him, but because\nshe needed to eat, too. Her days were her own; she could shop,\nread, tend house, or sew.\nWhen\nthe Pin Wielders Society wasn't working on a quilt, they bicycled\nalong Cripple Creek. Clara came to like its rocky shores and\nthe myths that surrounded it.\n\"Got\nits name when a horse busted its leg midway across,\"\nMiss Easten said one day, but Mrs. Bunn challenged her.\n\"Got\nits name when Mrs. Gilman--as long-faced as a horse, mind\nyou--busted her leg half way across.\"\nThe\nwomen laughed and Clara felt shamed for joining in. But still\nshe laughed until she felt a stitch in her side. They arrived\nat Mrs. Bunn's to hear the news that there was a collapse\nat the Pessimist Shaft.\n\"A\nperfectly dreadful name,\" Clara said.\nThough\nit was not Benjamin's mine, it was that of Miss Easten's beau.\nClara brought Emily home with her that evening, for the young\nwoman had no one else to take her in. She'd followed Louis\nto Cripple Creek the prior spring and was still waiting for\nhim to make her his bride.\n\"This\nis the punishment, isn't it?\" Emily said. \"Momma\nsaid I was nothing but a whore, would never be a wife. Never.\"\nEmily wrung her hands together and paced.\nClara\nfound no comfort in the evening. Benjamin did not come home,\nso Clara made sure Emily was comfortable and cared for. Neither\ncould be fully distracted, but at least Emily slept before\nsunrise. Clara went to her room, but found no solace in the\nbed. Instead, she took up the fabric pouch and cradled it\nagainst her. Its warmth slid over her, into her, and she sat,\nidle and relaxed for the first time in hours.\nThe\nroom faded and she was on that crystalline path again. She\nlooked at the sky to find nothing she recognized. Rather than\none moon, there was two. One was blue and as swollen as a\nwoman nine months with child, the other small like a pearl.\nThe\ndark man was at her side again. He extended his hand and showed\nher the hole in the ground. Clara watched and a bright silver\ndisk cut through the dirt. It vanished amid screams.\n\"We\ndidn't all die,\" he said and when he touched Clara's\ncheek, she felt the same warmth she had from the pouch. \"Find\nme?\"\nBenjamin\nslid naked into bed behind her sometime that morning. Clara\nopened her eyes to sunlight as Benjamin wrapped his body around\nhers. He smelled like dirt and metal. The fabric pouch nestled\nbetween Clara's breasts, undisturbed by Benjamin. It remained\nwarm, so warm, and Clara felt boneless between it and her\nhusband.\n\"Find\nme?\" Clara asked. Even as she formed the words, she didn't\nunderstand them. Benjamin nuzzled her neck.\n\"Mmm?\"\n\"Survivors?\"\nThose words were better, what she'd meant to say. She opened\nher eyes to look down at the pouch. Its strings were loose\nand her chest was flecked with dirt.\n\"Only\ndirt,\" Benjamin said, and sank into sleep.\nClara\nslipped out of his arms and closed the pouch before she returned\nit to the drawer. She closed the drawer reluctantly.\nBenjamin\nwas up before Clara, dressing in the dark that still cloaked\nthe room. He didn't turn on the light for fear of waking her;\nshe'd spent a restless night, muttering in her sleep.\nMen\nwere already stomping their way to the Half Moon Shaft when\nBenjamin arrived; wasn't much more rescuing to be done at\nthe Pessimist. Negroes and Johnnies were among the men; Root\ndidn't care who was doing the digging, as long as it got done.\nThe large conical hats of the Johnnies made strange shapes\nin the early half-light, pyramids that floated toward a similar\ndestination.\nThe\nmouth of the mine stank like the back end of a skunk. It was\ntruly a wonder that Clara didn't give him hell for smelling\nthe way he did. Benjamin wrapped his cotton scarf over his\nnose and mouth for the ride down in the lift.\nBenjamin\nstepped out at the lowest level of the mine, easing his way\npast the massive timbers which held the ground steady. It\nwas warm down here, so warm he wondered if they might reach\nthe center of the earth some day. Crack it open and be looking\nat the Johnnies on the other side.\nWater\nwas ankle deep today and Benjamin crouched as best he could\nwithout wetting the seat of his pants. It was no use; he was\nwet before he'd even reached his work. Root had him working\nhere with a single colored man; said he thought there was\nsomething special down this far. Said it like Root knew more\nthan he was telling.\nArmstrong\nlooked like his name, like he could hold up the ceiling should\nthe world begin to swallow them. Armstrong was quiet, didn't\ntalk much and when he did it was mostly singing. He wore a\ncharm bag around his neck, one probably filled with animal\nskin and horns, dirt from his native land, magical things.\nBenjamin wanted to ask more about it, but had been told by\nRoot not to. Another man had asked, and that man was no longer\nworking the Half Moon Shaft.\nThe\nlight was poor; Benjamin could hardly tell if he was digging\ngold or mud. Maybe it was all just rocks, he thought as he\nslipped one into his pocket. Couldn't hurt. Root would never\nknow.\nWhen\nBenjamin stopped and wiped his face with his scarf, he saw\nthe glitter of metal on the cloth. Whatever he was digging,\nit was good. Plain rock didn't glitter like that.\n\"How\nfar down you think?\" Armstrong asked late into the day.\nHis\nvoice was close in the small space. Benjamin stopped in his\nwork again, looked at Armstrong, then back toward the main\nshaft. \"Fifteen hundred feet?\"\nBenjamin's\npick hit something hard that crumpled under the assault. He\nabandoned the pick and began to dig with his hands. He and\nArmstrong raked until their thighs were covered in mud and\nmetal, and they had exposed a slim length of silver.\nThey\ncontinued to dig until Benjamin broke through and cold, rushing\nair washed over them. Only it wasn't air, or at least any\nkind Benjamin had ever breathed, for his vision swam and the\ntunnel went abruptly dark.\nAround\nthem, the walls vibrated and lurched, and as it turned out,\nArmstrong wasn't strong enough to hold up the ceiling.\nAbout\nthis time, Clara's bicycle hit a stone, tossing her from the\nseat. She flew over the handlebars to land in an indelicate\nheap near the creek bank. Mrs. Bunn came to her rescue and\nthough Clara could sew her torn hem, her bent tire was another\nmatter. She headed home slowly, her left ankle throbbing.\nHer vision swam and she had to sit. It had become hard to\nbreathe and it seemed darker, though the sun had yet to set.\nClara\nlooked at the sky, pressed a hand to her chest and tried with\nall her might to calm down. Eventually, she regained her breath,\nand hurried as quickly as she could home. Considering her\nankle and bent bicycle, it wasn't very quick at all. Still,\nBenjamin had yet to arrive, so Clara cleaned herself up and\nhobbled around the kitchen, cursing as she worked on dinner.\nGives the food more flavor, Mrs. Irving would say.\nEmily\nEasten would not be at dinner; Mrs. Raglin had invited her\nto stay until matters of the funeral could be settled. As\nClara set the table, she glanced at the clock and frowned,\nfor it was much later than she'd thought, and Benjamin should\nhave been home.\nShould\nhave beens didn't help matters, for the hour grew later and\nthe sky darker, and Benjamin remained away. Clara lay down,\nfor her head and ankle hurt terribly, and when she rose, little\nhad changed.\nShe\nstumbled to the bureau and withdrew the still-warm pouch of\ndirt. Holding it calmed her, brought her some measure of comfort.\nThe pain seemed to bleed right out of her as her fingers strayed\ninto the warm soil. A sob of relief escaped her and she sat\non the windowsill, staring up at the night sky. It shifted\ninto unfamiliar stars.\n\"Find\nme.\" The voice was insistent now, no longer kind. Clara\nflung the pouch to the ground.\n\"--Moon\nShaft! It's the Half Moon! She's goin' down!\"\nThere\nin the street was a lantern, seemingly floating, but on further\ninspection, Clara spied the youth who carried it. Clara closed\nher eyes and told herself no, that it wasn't so.\n\"Half\nMoon's goin' down!\"\n\"Blazes,\"\nshe whispered, and dressed herself before the first ladies\nstarted to call. Clara tucked the pouch into her pocket and\nushered Mrs. Bunn into the house. Mrs. Bunn thrust a packed\nbasket into Clara's hands.\n\"My\ndear, I had to come. And you know, he'll be home soon, I'm\nsure he just stayed to help, being that kind of a man and\nall.\" Mrs. Bunn made her way back to the kitchen and\nin moments, Clara, still rooted in the entry, smelled fresh\ncoffee. \"My dear?\"\nMrs.\nBunn poked her head out to find that Clara had not moved.\n\"Come, come.\" Mrs. Bunn propelled Clara into the\nkitchen. \"I lost my first husband to a cave in. Was really\na blessing as his health was not good. Coughing black tar\nall over my fine linens.\" She clicked her tongue and\npressed Clara into a chair. \"That was Half Moon Shaft,\ndid I tell you that?\"\nClara's\neyes widened.\n\"Well,\nno,\" Mrs. Bunn continued, \"I would not have told\nyou that. It was a good many years ago--there was talk of\na meteor strike near the shaft. Something came down, the mine\ncollapsed a bit. Lost my second one the same way, different\nmine but I'll not be losing Mr. Bunn to the mines, no ma'am.\"\nShe began to unpack the basket, placing a small loaf of bread\nnear Clara's hand. \"Fresh berry. No, Mr. Bunn enjoys\ncounting the profits, but doesn't like getting down there.\nHere, dear.\"\nClara\ndrank the coffee black, though she preferred it sweetened.\nMrs. Bunn filled the cup again and took one for herself.\n\"My\nfather was a miner,\" Clara said. \"I don't know how\nmy mother stood it. Not well, I don't think as she was upset\nwhen I brought Benjamin home. I don't think...\" She faltered\nand rubbed her hand over the pouch in her pocket. \"She\ndidn't want me to go through this.\"\nBut\ngo through it was the only thing she could do. There was no\nway to go around. On the second night without Benjamin, Clara\nstuffed socks into the toes of Benjamin's spare boots until\nthey fit her, and laced them tight.\n\"Find\nme,\" she whispered and clutched the pouch of dirt against\nher chest as she left the house. She glanced at the night\nsky and it shifted between what she knew and what she didn't.\nWhere was she? \"Earth, you ninny,\" she told herself.\nBut whatever was in the pouch wasn't from Earth, was it? \"We\ndidn't all die...we didn't all die.\"\nClara\nfound herself in unfamiliar surroundings. Evergreens rose\naround her, though they thinned in the distance. Clara squinted\nat the hills, trying to remember Benjamin's carefully constructed\ncourting, and the way he talked up the mountains.\n\"Rose\nBud,\" she said, but couldn't tell it from the others\nin the darkness. \"Gold Hill.\" It was easy enough\nto eventually find; it was splattered with mines, and even\nin the darkness stank like metal and deep earth.\nShe\nclawed her way along the hill, past one mine, and another,\nfocused on something she could not see. But she could feel\nit and the pouch in her pocket had begun to grow warmer. She\nfinally had to take it out and wear it around her neck, for\nwhere it pressed against her thigh felt burned.\nThere\nwere few men about; a handful of wagons rolled past but no\none saw Clara. She thought they would question her, but she\nslipped past and continued on.\nThe\nsmall hole in the ground was not what she had expected, but\nit looked familiar. It was not the formal entrance to a mine,\nbut more of a cave. She stepped into the dark mouth and stopped,\nunable to convince herself to continue. It was much too dark\nand she was much too alone.\nAround\nher neck, the pouch began to glow. She took it off, fearful\nof being burned, and its silvery light illuminated the rough\nwalls. The pouch was no longer painful, only helpful in that\nit allowed her to see the ground and the walls, and before\nshe knew it, Clara was inside the cave, descending.\n\"Blazes.\nWhat am I doing? What are you?\" She squeezed the pouch\nand the light faltered, only steadying when her hold loosened.\nThe\ntunnel narrowed and grew steep and she looped the pouch around\nher neck, needing her hands to hold on to the walls. At one\npoint, she slipped and the light circled around her as she\nfell. Up and down were the same, until she hit bottom.\nTepid\nwater greeted her, broke her fall. She floundered in the water\nand gasped for breath. Her hands were raw, she tasted blood\nin her mouth, and darkness was all around her. There was only\nher breathing in the small space. Clara reached her wounded\nhands out and felt the close walls. She finally found a small\ncrawlspace, but did not move.\n\"Go\nor stay, them's the choices,\" she told herself.\nShe\npressed the pouch against her forehead and the walls faded.\nShe was again on alien ground, with that impossibly dark man.\n\"You're\nnearly here,\" he said and he touched the heaviest moon.\nClara\nlooked at the small wet space in which she found herself.\nYes, she might as well be on a moon, for it was just as unfamiliar\nto her.\n\"Go\nor stay?\" she whispered.\n\"Come,\"\nthe alien voice beckoned.\nClara\nwriggled until she fit into the space and as she crawled on,\nthe pouch brightened again. Like it wanted her to go on.\nThe\nair around her was warm and smelled pleasantly of damp earth.\nLike a garden after a rainfall. The dirt here was dark, and\nthe idea that it had never seen daylight gave Clara a thrill.\nHow deep was she? She listened and could hear nothing save\nfor her own breathing. She pressed her hands against the walls\nand felt only warm earth.\nIt\nwas somehow comforting and when she spied the faint glitter\nin the dirt above her, she understood the appeal for Benjamin.\nThe world above was chaotic, but this place was simple, full\nof mystery.\nAhead,\nshe thought she heard voices, but told herself she was being\nfoolish. Clara bowed her head and tried to be calm. She wiped\nher face and blew her dirty nose on her sleeve before continuing.\nThe\nvoices grew clearer the further she went. She tried not to\nlisten, for they were surely not a good sign of her sanity.\nShe could not make out the words, could only hear the men--two\nmen, she thought--conversing as though they were at tea.\nBenjamin's\nvoice? She wanted to leap up, but there was not room enough.\n\"Benjamin!\" she cried with the hope that they could\nhear her as she heard them. And if not, then she really had\nleft her mind up top.\nThe\nmen fell silent.\n\"Ben!\nBenjamin Claver!\"\n\"Clara?\nMy God--Clara!\"\nHe\nwas close, very close, but around a curve, dirt blocked her\npath. Clara began to dig and felt fingers brush her own as\nshe worked. When she next felt it, she clasped that hand,\ncertain it was her own Benjamin's, but it was too big and\ntoo black.\n\"Benjamin!\"\nThe\ndirt cascaded around her and those black hands clasped her\narms, pulling her into the next section of tunnel. Clara found\nherself in the lap of a large Negro, her own Benjamin crouched\nnearby.\nSeeing\nClara was like glimpsing the sky, no matter that it was dirty.\nBenjamin wrapped his arms around her and squeezed for all\nhe was worth.\n\"What\nin damnation are you doing here?\" Benjamin shook Clara,\nfor in his mind's eye she was safe and home, not mucking through\nan unstable mining shaft. She was mending, cooking, doing\nanything but being here.\n\"The\npouch lead me here. I think.\" Clara looked at Benjamin\nand then noticed the silver object to her right. \"What\nis that?\"\nWhat\nit looked like was an upside down tea saucer. Clara touched\nit and found it smooth and warm, and broken. She opened the\npouch and dumped the dirt out. She rubbed her fingers over\nthe now-loose dirt and shards of silver made themselves known.\nSilver that matched the upside down tea saucer. Clara began\nto gather them up.\n\"Don't\nknow what it is, but it's worth something,\" Benjamin\nsaid. \"Been digging on it since the tunnel collapsed--it's\nbig, Clara.\"\n\"Worth\nsomething,\" Clara agreed, \"but it's not ours.\"\nShe looked at Armstrong, noted his pouch, then looked at the\nsilver in her hand. \"I think it belongs to itself.\"\nShe bundled the silver shards together and placed them along\nthe outer curve of the saucer.\nLike\nice on a hot sidewalk, the shards melted into the saucer.\nShe would have to tell Mrs. Bunn it wasn't a meteor, Clara\nthought.\nThe\ntunnel began to rumble.\n\"Found\nme,\" Armstrong said. \"You found me.\"\nBenjamin\nlunged for Clara, trying to protect her for surely this was\nthe end; the mine was finally going to give way and they'd\nbe on the other side of the world looking at Johnnies soon.\n\"Hang on--\"\nThe\nsaucer burst out of the ground, tunneling upward as though\nthe dirt were as soft as whipped cream. The silver saucer\nspiraled into a day-bright sky and beyond, vanishing in two\nblinks. Benjamin, Clara, and Armstrong were left staring up\nthe long shaft, at faces peering down.\n\"Claver?\"\nRoot called down to them. \"What in tarnation was that?\nClaver?\"\n\"Midas's\nriches gone like that,\" Benjamin whispered.\n\"Found\nyou?\" Clara asked, looking into the liquid-brown eyes\nof the Negro. She wanted to touch him, but he didn't look\nquite solid. If she looked sideways, he would vanish altogether.\nArmstrong\nclasped Benjamin's hand, and then Clara's, and brought them\ntogether. Armstrong felt a relief he had not known in many\nyears. The pouch around his neck was once again warm, once\nagain hopeful.\n\"Your\nriches are outside this hole.\"\n\"He's\nright, you know,\" Benjamin said. \"I already found\nmy treasure. Don't know why I thought I had to look further.\"\nClara\nblushed under the mud that covered her. She bowed her head\nand spied the shine of gold in the muck around them. She pried\nthe nugget loose and pressed it into Benjamin's palm.\n\"Clara\nClaver in Cripple Creek,\" Benjamin said with a laugh\nas he wiped mud from her cheeks. \"Mining gold.\"\n\"Ain't\nthat the sweetest thing ever?\" Clara whispered a moment\nbefore she kissed him.\nArmstrong\ntook hold of them and they spiraled up the shaft as the silver\nsaucer had. Benjamin and Clara dropped back to the ground,\nbut Armstrong kept going, high into the bright sky until he\nvanished in a silver spark.\n\"Man\nalive, Claver! I feared you was a gone sucker.\" Mr. Root\ngrasped Benjamin's filthy sleeve and tried to turn him from\nClara, but he wouldn't be turned. \"What was that?\"\n\"Looked\nlike a giant tea saucer,\" Benjamin said and skimmed his\nhands over Clara to remove more mud from her.\nRoot\ntossed his hat to the ground. \"A tea saucer! And what\nwas Armstrong then, a drop of tea?\"\nBenjamin\nchuckled. \"Well that would just be absurd. Mr. Root,\nyou won't mind if I take a few days off, will you? I'm feeling\nplum peaked.\" He scraped mud out of his collar and flung\nit to the ground. It splattered Root's shoes.\n\"Plum\npeaked,\" Clara agreed as they walked away from Root's\nmuttered protests. \"Mr. Claver, you gave me quite a scare.\"\nBenjamin's arm around her tightened and he admitted he'd given\nhimself a scare, too. His hip knocked against hers and Clara\nfrowned. \"What's that in your pocket, Benjamin?\"\nBenjamin\nkicked a stone out of their path and patted his pockets. They\nwere lumpy as if with rocks, but when he dared slip a finger\nin, it was warm. Warm like the inside of Clara's mouth when\nhe dared to slip his tongue inside. \"Just rocks.\"\nThe\nEnd","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20051030133631\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/janmar2003\/pocketfullofrocks.htm","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/HRB63v-3jF7iVbgP+6b7g8tV+38.json","volume":4.0,"issues":1.0,"has_text":true}

I need a break from work.\"\n\"Be careful, the countryside is filled\nwith desperate people since the Depression began. God, I can't\nbelieve it's only been a year.\"\n\"Neither can I, and don't worry, I'll\nbe fine.\" The judge slipped into his suit coat and with\na wave, left the chambers. His clothes were already packed\nand in the car. The four-hour road trip appealed to him; he\nneeded to relax, and driving the 1928 Packard Saloon to the\nmountains was a joy in itself. Children scampered down the\nstreet toward him; most had looks of hunger. The judge called\nseveral over and gave them each twenty-five cents, enough\nto buy bread and milk for their families. A daily ritual.\nWith the lights of New York City far behind\nhim, Joseph whistled a tune and again gave thanks to the heavens\nhe didn't suffer like so many people during those bleak times.\nBeing a compassionate man, his heart ached every time he saw\nthe haunted faces of the destitute. The judge gave away a\nthird of his salary to the needy.\nPresident Hoover wouldn't be re-elected\nto another term, no doubt in his mind. Governor Roosevelt\nhad some good ideas and all ready had made assertions he would\nbe running for President the next election.\nJoseph believed in premonitions. In early\n'28, after making a fortune in the stock market, he woke up\nfrom a deep sleep. Visions of panic, banks closed, and thousands\nof people out of work from the market crashing, sent icy tendrils\nof fear around his heart. It was a warning. Cash in and stuff\nit under your mattress. He also saw metallic flying objects\nflying all over the sky. The next morning he called his stockbroker\nand told him to convert everything to cash.\n\"Judge, you're making a big mistake.\nNow's the time to stay in, the market's going to break records\nand you'll miss out. Trust me.\"\n\"I'm sure you're right, Roger. Now,\ndo as I say, and call me when I can pick the check up.\"\nThe next stop was a hardware store where he purchased a home\nsafe, to be delivered that afternoon. Roger called him while\nhe was securing the small safe in his bedroom and told him\nthe check would be ready in the morning. Again, he told the\njudge the money should stay in the brokerage and buy more\nstock. Again, the judge refused.\nWhen Joseph cashed the check the next day,\nhe bought the Packard on his way back home. Once the money\nwas in the safe, he drove to the courthouse. As a New York\nSupreme Court Justice, his docket allowed him a certain amount\nof freedom on his time.\nAfter the stock market crashed, banks closed,\nthousands of people were out of work and the Great Depression\nstarted. Only a small select group of people stayed wealthy.\nJoseph was one of them. He had acted on a premonition and\nhad been saved. Anything out of the ordinary was then looked\nat like cells under a microscope. The judge soon earned a\nreputation for being overly superstitious.\nThe shadows grew deeper as he entered the\nfoothills and began the long winding drive into the mountains.\nThere was no traffic on the road other than him. Peaceful\nand tranquil, a warm breeze blew over his face from the rolled\ndown window. He lived a good life.\nA high pitched, whining, noise invaded\nhis mind. Sweat beaded on his forehead and he thought his\neyes had gone bad. The ice blue object floated over the car,\nnot more than fifty feet above it! His foot slammed on the\nbrake, the Packerd screeching to a stop in the middle of the\nroad. Blinking lights came from the circular base and it dropped\nbehind a grove of pine trees not far from the car. Joseph\npulled over to the side and got out. Pulsating flashes emanated\nfrom behind the grove. It was so thick with trees he couldn't\nsee what the object was from where he stood. Quickly, much\nfaster than a man of forty-one, Joseph ran across the road\nand through the groves until he came to a rock outcropping.\nThe saucer shaped metallic object rested on four pods and\nwas the size of twenty Packard's. There appeared to be an\nopening with a ramp extending to the ground. A thin, slippery\nlooking form stood near the base of the object, standing on\ntwo legs. Joseph didn't move a muscle, he was transfixed by\nthe sight.\nThe form seemed to turn toward Joseph and\ngracefully glided over the terrain like an ice skater on a\npond. Joseph couldn't move. He stared as the figure approached\nhim. His mind clouded then a soft, soothing thought formed\nin his conscious.\nDo not be afraid. I wish you no harm.\n\"I\nI\nwho are you?\"\nA visitor to your planet.\n\"Where are you from?\"\nA slender iridescent arm pointed up at an angle toward a distant\ntwinkling star.\nWe call our planet, Kzaan-tkai.\n\"Why are you here?\" Joseph realized he asked his\nquestions out loud, but decided it didn't make any difference\nsince the alien being answered him.\nTo study humans and develop friendships. Your species are\nvery\ninteresting. So young, so ambitious.\n\"You are evidently far superior to us in knowledge, why\nspend your\ntime with us? Surely there are other worlds inhabited?\"\nDo not be frightened. I am going to fill your mind with thoughts\nof\nour world, our culture and our people.\nJoseph gasped. Colors of greens, reds and yellows flashed\nacross his mind. Visions of a world shaped by communities\nof caring, compassionate, gentle beings wove through his consciousness.\nA feeling of warmth and love filled his body. He saw a history\nof the world, one with no war, no neglect, no crime. He could\nfeel his soul longing for Kzaan-tkai. It was a sign. No doubt.\n\"May I go with you?\"\nDo you truly wish to?\n\"Yes, I'm ready now.\"\nYou may come, but you can never return. Come back here in\nfive nights. We will be here. If you arrive and are still\nwilling, we will take you with us.\nThe Packerd's engine hummed as it sped toward New York at\nseventy miles an hour. Joseph had several things to do before\nhe went back. The money he put in the bank on Fifth Avenue\nto show new faith in the system would have to be removed.\nHis safe at home held a large amount of cash. It wouldn't\nbe that hard to put it to good use.\nOver the weekend the judge selected certain\nfiles from his office. Those went into the incinerator in\nthe basement of the building. They had contained newspaper\nclippings, handwritten letters and interviews with people\nseeing the future, having premonitions and accounts of men\nand women swearing they had encountered strange aliens, not\nfrom this world. No one needs to associate this with me, he\nthought. The last thing he bought was a 1924 Model T Ford.\nThe title was made out to a fictitious William Fortmeyer and\nhe parked it two blocks south of the theater. After he met\nwith some friends Tuesday, before the play, he would take\na taxi to a hotel near the Model T. This is the car he would\ndrive to the meeting place. It would be found abandoned, but\nnot connected with him.\nMonday morning he wrote two checks totaling\n$5500. With the money from his safe he drove around to the\nsoup kitchens and distributed the money. The money from the\nchecks he put into an envelope and took it with him to his\nchambers at the courthouse.\n\"Jimmy, open this envelope after next\nFriday and keep quiet about it. I'm going on a business trip\nupstate on Thursday and will be gone for two weeks.\"\nJoseph patted the clerk on his shoulder, \"you've been\nwith me for twelve years and I appreciate your loyalty.\"\n\"Is something wrong, Sir?\" Jimmy\ntucked the envelope into his jacket pocket.\n\"No. Not at all. Sometimes we neglect\nto say thanks, that's all.\" A smile spread across his\nface. \"Tomorrow night, I'm going to the play, Dancing\nPartners, then I'll leave the next day. Goodbye, Jimmy.\"\n\"Judge?\"\n\"Yes, Jimmy.\"\n\"It's been my pleasure to serve you\nall these years. I know of no one as respected as you. Now\nI feel good telling you that.\"\n\"Thank you, we should do it more often,\nshouldn't we?\"\n\"I have a premonition,\" Jimmy\nproudly said.\nThe judge stopped in his tracks, his attention\ndrawn like a magnet to his clerk. \"What is it?\"\n\"I think people will remember\nJudge Joseph Crater for years to come. Yep, Judge Crater,\njurist supreme.\"\nWhere is Judge Crater?\nBy Franklin Bowmark, New York Times\nNew York City - On Aug. 6, 1930, Joseph Force Crater - a New\nYork Supreme Court Justice, told friends he would be attending\nthe Broadway play, \"Dancing Partner\" that evening,\nand was never seen or heard from again.

That is true enough, I suppose, in its own\nway. But folks are always talking about things they don\u2019t\nhave first-hand knowledge of. Me, I was there, I knew both\nthe gentlemen, not like we were chummy or anything, I was\nonly a kid. I cleaned up and I ran errands as people around\nthe labs needed. I had dropped out of school when my father\ndied.\nTruth to tell, the two gentlemen got\non good to start with. I recall as how at that time, that\nwould have been in the middle eighties, the Oregon was\nin harbor with two bad dynamos. And Mr. Tesla, he took his\nequipment over to the ship to work on the dynamos, fixed\nthem both up, worked until five in the morning, and on the\nway back he met Edison and some others, and Edison figures\nthis foreign fellow has had a night out on the town. But\nMr. Tesla explained himself, and the old man, he appreciated\nhard work and diligence. So Mr. Tesla had earned his respect.\nAnd as it turned out, Tesla was a hard worker, eighteen\nhours a day, hardest worker of all except for the old man\nhimself.\nI always called Mr. Edison the old man,\nthough not aloud. I reckon now he was not so old as I thought\nhe was. As for Mr. Tesla, he was closer to my own age, and\nhe was friendly-like, he spoke to me on several occasions\nduring those months. He called me William, never called\nme Will, and of course he had that accent, being foreign.\nHe told me how important it was to do my job and be dependable,\nand confided in me that he had done many jobs worse than\nmine, and worked harder and longer hours. And he told me\nthat when I was able, I should continue my education, that\nit was important. I suppose if he saw me now, he might be\ndisappointed, for I never received much education beyond\nwhat I already had.\nThe two gentlemen had some disagreements\nnow and again. Mr. Edison was stubborn as a mule, and nobody\ncouldn\u2019t make him change his mind, but he would always listen\nto anybody, give him a chance. Me, I never understood half\nthe stuff I overheard, I just watched and listened and went\nabout my business.\nBut the funny thing was this. Mr. Edison\u2019s\nattitude toward Mr. Tesla changed, changed overnight, or\nI should say his treatment of him. His attitude changed,\nif you\u2019ll excuse the expression, like flipping a light switch.\nAnd I am certain to this day that it was no fault of Mr.\nTesla\u2019s, just as I am certain that Mr. Edison was not acting\nentirely according to his conscience. It was a strange thing\ntruly, for though I saw the old man treat the other unfairly,\nand heard him speak unkindly, yet I couldn\u2019t help feeling\nhe was kind of double-minded about it, like he was doing\nit for some reason against his will.\nAnd it all went back to one single evening.\nIt was late, and most people had gone home. I would have\nlong been home myself by that hour, but the old man himself\nhad sent me out to get some items for his personal use.\nSo there I was on the top floor of that\nmain building. It was a modern building for its time, goes\nwithout saying it was electric, but many of the lights were\noff so it was dim-like. Tall ceilings, wide hallway, and\nI don\u2019t mind telling you I was a little bit spooked as I\nwas not used to being there so late, with it dark and deserted.\nSo when I saw this funny blue light at the end of the hall,\nit startled me and I just stopped right there, standing\nthere with that box.\nI neared the end of the hall where the\nold man had his own large room with a little office area\nat the front of it. The door was ajar, which was nothing\nunusual, and the light inside was dim, also nothing unusual.\nHe kept the strangest hours of any man I ever knew, and\nhe even kept a cot right there handy so that he could sleep\nat any time. And he would often take naps of an hour or\nless and jump up and be right back at work.\nMy first clue that something was out\nof the ordinary was, as I said, a blue light which I saw\nemanate from behind the door, and the sight of it stopped\nme dead in my tracks. It started out dim, barely visible\nagainst whatever electric light burned in the room, and\nit grew more intense in a few seconds before it went out\nentirely. And I venture to guess that Mr. Edison was in\nfact sleeping, because I heard an exclamation from him,\nsounding like someone startled awake, and a little loud,\non account of his deafness. And right then, as I say, I\nnearly dropped that box of goods and rushed in to see what\nthe matter was; but something made me hold back, and I was\nalways glad I did.\nInstead I eased the box to the floor\nquiet-like and crept forward slowly. Presently I was surprised\nto hear voices coming from the room. I say surprised, because\nI had every reason to expect the old man was by himself\nin there.\nOne voice was certainly Mr. Edison\u2019s,\nand there was a small degree of alarm or agitation in it,\nwhich soon went away. I was still too far away to make out\nany words, though I knew I did not recognize the stranger\u2019s\nvoice. But I kept creeping forward, painfully slow, and\neventually I could overhear some of the conversation.\nAnd an odd conversation it was. I feared\nto get too close, so I could not make out the whole thing.\nThere was some talk of a book, and of a calamity of some\nkind, a danger. From my vantage point against the wall,\nI craned my neck a little, and could make out a little of\nthe scene. They were not at the front area, or I could have\nheard better, but more towards the back of the room. Mr.\nEdison was seated by the side of the long workbench, thumbing\nthrough a book, and the stranger stood before him.\nI have never seen anyone dressed in such\na way, before or since. My first impression was of some\nkind of one-piece garment like overalls; but it was of a\nfabric or material I was not familiar with, some material\nwhich wrinkled like cloth but was shiny as steel. The sight\nwas so strange that I confess it occurred to me to wonder\nwhether Mr. Edison was being visited by an angel. I don\u2019t\nput too much stock in such stuff, but I was reminded of\nSunday school, and the young man in shiny white at the tomb.\nBut the fellow looked earthly enough,\neven if he looked out of place, and the tone of his voice\ndid not seem anything too odd to me. He kept pointing out\nthings in the book as Mr. Edison turned the pages; and he\nhad some other things to show him also. One thing was like\na framed picture, but I swear to you that the picture moved,\nlike a magic lantern, but with nowhere to project from.\nI saw it clearly as it was angled toward me once, and I\nheard sounds come from it plain as day, voices and music\nand sounds like crowds of people at a distance. And Mr.\nEdison grew so excited that he got up and began to pace,\nand I was forced to duck back into the darkness for fear\nhe should see me.\nAnd I heard him ask how was this all\npossible? And the stranger was talking about a river. He\nsaid that time was like a river, though I cannot say what\nhe meant by that.\nThere was some urgency to his tone as\nif he was trying to persuade Mr. Edison of something. And\nhe spoke more of calamity or disaster, but I could never\ncatch any specifics. And he said finally that he had only\na short time to stay here, only a few minutes, and he said\nhe would leave the book, but that it should not fall into\nanyone else\u2019s hands. And he said he had to leave immediately.\nThis caused me some concern, as there\nwas only one way out of the room and the building, and he\nwould have to pass right by me. But I sneaked a peek anyway,\nand saw that the stranger was not moving toward the door\nat all, but he went and stood in a bare spot on the floor.\nAnd then \u2013 why should you believe me?\n\u2013 the stranger began to glow with that same blue light,\nand only a second passed before there was a brilliant flash\nthat took a few seconds to die away. I saw spots before\nmy eyes. If you have ever been photographed and you looked\nstraight at the powder when it flared, you know what I mean.\nIn the awful silence that followed, my\nheart was hammering. It was only seconds before I started\nto doubt the evidence of my senses, and I wanted to pinch\nmyself to see if it had all been a dream. And sneaking another\npeek, I saw the old man clutching the book in both his hands\nand staring at it like he had never seen a book before in\nall his days. And I figured he felt the same, that he couldn\u2019t\nbelieve his eyes, and was holding tight to the one thing\nhe had that showed it was all real.\nI kept watching, though I hated eavesdropping\nand spying. And I saw him walk up toward the door, to the\noffice area; and he took the book and put it in a drawer\nof his desk\nI did not want him to suspect that I\nhad been around, so I counted a hundred slow-like and then\ndid it again to let some time pass. Then I took a deep breath\nand grabbed the box by the handles and walked in as if I\nhad just arrived.\nHe took the stuff and he said, \u201cThank\nyou, Will,\u201d but you could see his mind was elsewhere. He\ngave me a dime and sent me off, and I never spoke to him\nof what I saw.\nIt was two nights before I could find\na chance to do what I had to do. The old man kept a a strange\nschedule, and you could never tell when he was coming or\ngoing.\nBut I had found out by listening that\nhe was for sure going to be away that night, and I arranged\nto be there. My supervisor trusted me with a set of keys;\nbut I had no good excuse for being around at that hour,\nso I was feeling a little scared and very cautious.\nNo sooner had I set foot on the stairs\nthan I encountered Mr. Tesla himself coming down, and my\nheart leaped in my chest. \u201cGood evening, William,\u201d he said\nin his clipped, precise way of talking, and I stammered\nan answer. \u201cYou are not getting into trouble, are you?\u201d\nhe asked; and for a second I was awfully afraid, but then\nI realized he was just joking with me. \u201cNo, sir,\u201d\nI said, and I grinned as well as I could, and we passed\non the stairs, and that was that.\nNo one else was around, and I got to\nthe third floor without seeing anyone. At the end of the\nhall, the old man\u2019s door was locked, as did not surprise\nme, but my key opened it. I risked the electric light, as\nfolks were used to seeing it at all hours anyhow.\nThe drawers were not locked as no one\nwould dare mess with the old man\u2019s things, and I was amazed\nthat I was trying it myself. The middle drawer on the right\nheld the mysterious book.\nBefore I even opened it, it was unusual\nto me. The cover was very flat and the binding very plain;\nI would have thought that it was simply a cheap item except\nthat the workmanship seemed so fine. On reflection, it seemed\nplain in the same way that the engineers preferred their\nsurroundings and furnishings, Spartan and no-nonsense. The\ntitle was in shiny letters, plain and blocky, and would\nyou believe I cannot remember what it said? But it said\nsomething about the Tesla Institute, of that I am sure.\nI did not finish my schooling, as I say, but I could read\nall right. The name jumped right out at me, of course, and\nI wondered if it had to do with some relative of our Mr.\nTesla.\nAnd when I opened it, the pages themselves\nwere brilliant white and so smooth that they were shiny,\nand the print was fine and crisp and black. There was no\nfrontispiece to the book or anything of that sort; I guess\nthere was a table of contents, but I don\u2019t recall. I flipped\nthrough it slowly with a keen curiosity and a growing sense\nof wonder.\nThe pictures! That is what I remember\nbest. I do not mean engravings or drawings such as we are\nso used to, but actual photographs. Now we have all seen\nphotographs reproduced in books, but these were different.\nThey were crisp and clear, and they were like frozen moments\nin time. I saw things that were clearly in motion, and yet\nthey were photographed and made to look as though they were\nstanding still. And they were in color, and I would bet\nyou that no human hand had colored them. They just looked\ntoo natural, too lifelike.\nBut the things in the pictures, that\nwas what puzzled and disturbed me most. For many of those\nthings I was certain had never existed anywhere, not in\nmy part of the world or any other, and yet there I was looking\nat them. And as I said, they were not drawings, you could\ntell they were photographs.\nI saw motor-cars racing down wide streets\nbetween huge buildings. Back then even in the cities we\nhardly even knew what auto-mobiles were. The folks I was\naround every day were excited by them, and were mightily\ninterested, for the most part. I had only seen a few motor-cars\npersonally. But these wheeled contraptions in the pictures\nwere the same kind of thing, if you get my drift,\neven if they were fully enclosed and oddly shaped and brightly\ncolored.\nSome of the pictures showed tall steel\ntowers that seemed to reach for heaven; some of them had\nshafts of light stabbing across the air between them. Even\nmore incredibly, I saw pictures of flying machines \u2013 I am\nnot making this up \u2013 airships of many different kinds. Some\nwere like dragonflies, not too unlike what the Wrights are\nnow building. Others were balloonlike, like giant whales\nswimming in mid-air. And finally, I swear to you I saw pictures\nof flying machines that were neither winged nor balloon-like,\nbut hung suspended in air by God knows what art, and they\nglowed at the bottom. And some of these were no larger than\nthe auto-mobiles were, and they flew between the buildings\nin large numbers.\nI could scarcely tear my eyes from the\npictures, but the words drew my curiosity, for I wanted\nsome kind of explanation. But I did not have much luck there.\nIt was in English all right, and I understood it for the\nmost part; but the sentences were short and choppy and I\ncouldn\u2019t make sense of much of it. There were words which\nI had never seen before. Not unusual perhaps, except that\nthere were so many of them. And there were numbers here\nand there that confused me, until I realized that they were\nmeant to signify years. I confess at that time it hadn\u2019t\ndawned on me that a year could ever start with a 19,\nas then we were still more than a decade from the turn of\nthe century.\nSo this started to read like a history\nbook, but with all the years the wrong way. It strained\nmy imagination, but I reckoned it was like taking a history\nof the last hundred years and somehow delivering it to George\nWashington: \u201cHere, sir, here\u2019s a record of the eighteenth\ncentury for you.\u201d That was what I was holding in my hands,\na history book of things that hadn\u2019t happened yet.\nOne year that sticks in my mind is 1973;\nit said something about gravity cancellation becoming practical\nin 1973. I do not know what that means, but it had to do\nwith the flying machines.\nWhat disturbed me most was something\nabout \u201cworld wars\u201d \u2013 three of them if I understood rightly.\nI do not know much about war, but I know it to be a terrible\nthing.\nSo I sat and read until my eyes were\nbleary, and I put the book back in its place. I left the\nbuilding, and no one ever knew I was there.\nIt was then that Mr. Edison began behaving\noddly. I recall meetings with his senior staff, meetings\nI naturally was not there for, but I overheard bits and\npieces as always. There was much arguing and discussion,\nand as I said, he was stubborn as a mule, and always got\nhis way.\nPeople started giving Mr. Tesla a cold\nshoulder, giving him a wide berth. I do not know whether\nhe even noticed. He was always wrapped up in the machines.\nOnce in one of the larger areas, I saw\nMr. Edison standing on a catwalk and looking down at where\nMr. Tesla was working. And his eyes as he looked at him\nwere funny, they were without malice and even held pity.\nI realized then where I had seen that look before. Out on\nmy uncle\u2019s place in the country, as a child, I saw that\nsame look on a farmer\u2019s face as he dealt a mercy-killing\nto an injured animal.\nAs far as I know, no one else ever saw\nthe book, and I only saw it once more. I was on the basement\nlevel one day, and I encountered Mr. Edison there, where\nI never saw him before or since. He did not speak to me,\nwhich was also unusual. The old man had the book in his\nhands, and I saw him personally feed it into the incinerator.\nNothing was ever the same between Mr.\nTesla and Mr. Edison, or between him and anyone really.\nIn the end, so I heard, I am sorry to say they actually\ncheated him out of a large sum of money that they had promised\nhim on completing some work. He left us then, of his own\nwill so far as I know, and I have never seen him since.\nSome folks say that Mr. Edison set out\nto destroy or, what\u2019s the word, discredit Mr. Tesla.\nWell, it did seem so, for that sort of thing continued even\nafter the other man had left. I do not know what it was\nabout, but it had less to do with \u201calternating current\u201d\nand more to do with the visit from the stranger, that is\nwhat I say. And I do claim that Mr. Tesla never deserved\nsuch treatment, nor was it wholly in character for Mr. Edison\nto behave so.\nAnd over the years I have given much\nthought to the whole matter, though nearly thirty years\nhave passed and my memory of those few minutes in the dark\nare so dim now. I would think that I had dreamed the whole\nthing, but that I don\u2019t have that much imagination.\nI stood on the riverbank once, and I\nbelieve I know what the stranger meant by saying time was\nlike a river. It flows on its own, and if you go with the\nflow, you go where it takes you. But you can move under\nyour own power if you want; you can go forward or backward,\nwith or against the current.\nBut there is something else about rivers.\nThey change courses. And I think that was the whole point\nof the visit, to fix something that went wrong somehow.\nI don\u2019t know what kind of disaster or calamity the visitor\nwas talking about, but it must be something worse than three\nworld wars.\nAnyhow, I reckon the river has changed\ncourse already. Did I tell you I tore a page from the book?\nIt was the only thing I ever stole from the old man or any\nother employer. That page mentioned in passing the First\nWorld War and how many died terribly in it. But that war\nbegan in 1910, so said the book. It is now 1911, and we\nhave had no war. So I suppose the river has changed course,\nand we have escaped that tragedy, and the world is a better\nplace. That is a good thing, then, isn\u2019t it?","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050727004221\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/octdec2003\/teslastime.htm","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/Hw3SrPyuiMWdbeIaedxNVreaD3k.json","volume":4.0,"issues":4.0,"has_text":true}

I had it tucked discretely out of sight\nin my cummerbund. I eased my hand out from under the hem\nof my jacket, but had to resist the urge to reach back.\nSeveral men, all of us agents, crowded around Harold Bonds\nfeigning interest in his bizarre proposals for gaining fortunes.\nI sat in the back analyzing as he told his preposterous\nfables.\nThe technical discussion over welding with something called\nacetylene, rather than with a smith\u2019s forge and hammers,\nleft my head spinning. In another one of those curiosities\nover Bonds\u2019 prattle, it turned out that an Englishman\nhad discovered something called acetylene recently, and\nword had trickled to the states. How Bonds had come by such\nknowledge was perplexing. His fanciful extrapolation of\nusing it to weld iron sounded great, but like all of his\nproposals, he was a bit shy with sufficient detail to make\nhis claim stand up.\nI realized my jaw was stiff, and urged myself to relax.\nIgnoring his words for a moment, I tried to take a fresh\nmeasure of the man. While he was tall, approaching six feet,\nhis appearance was uninspiring. Though still a young man,\nhe carried a pot gut and was clearly a dandy who had never\nput in a hard day\u2019s labor in his life. However, he\nseemed remarkably ignorant for someone who had led a sheltered\nlife. He spoke no other language than the heavily accented\nEnglish that he claimed as his mother tongue. Though vaguely\nTeutonic, I had never heard any dialect like it. Fortunately,\nwith the passage of weeks, his patois was fading, making\nthe task of listening to his stories easier.\nHe demonstrated an ignorance of most written works a well-educated\nman should be acquainted with, then inquired about a Samuel\nClemens with the amusing nom de plume of Mark Twain. Agents\nfound a gadabout of little note with that name, working\naboard a New Orleans riverboat, but when asked, the young\nlad professed little practice in writing, though he confessed\nto previous work in print shops and newspaper offices. I\nworried whether those tantalizing coincidences were hints\nthat Bonds\u2019 story could be true.\nMy musings were interrupted when a house Negress, a fine\nyoung woman with high cheekbones and scrubbed skin like\npolished ebony, opened the doors to the parlour. She had\nbeen stirring my interests for the last two weeks.\n\u201cSupper is served in the dining room, sirs, if you\nplease.\u201d She tried to keep her vision submissively\nfocused on the floor at her feet, but I caught her eye as\nwe shuffled out of the room and thought I came to an understanding\nwith her for later that evening. It had been a long season\nout here, gently prying at the secrets Mr. Bonds purported\nto be keeping from us. A bit of sport might just be what\nI needed to calm my disposition.\nBonds was perhaps the victim of an incredible misfortune,\nmore likely he was a charlatan. Part of my job was to confirm\nwhich. For some time he had resided here at the plantation\nof a fine southern aristocrat, regaling his host with improbable\ntales. The owner was an otherwise stalwart gentleman with\nsome connections to men of influence in Atlanta, but tended\nto be lonely out her in Smyrna, miles from refined company.\nWhen his field niggers had carried the fellow in from the\ncotton fields with a cockamamie story of his stumbling from\nthe midst of a dust devil, one taller than a two-story house\nand flashing lightning and crackling like it had come straight\nfrom Hades, he had given the story little credence. But\nthe oddly dressed fellow definitely appeared to be addled,\nso Colonel Brackett had offered a room for as long as the\nfellow wished to stay while he recovered. The extraordinary\ntales Bonds had told in the ensuing days had entertained\nthe old veteran.\nHe took no cotton to Bonds\u2019 claim of coming from the\nfuture, not at first. When the stranger expressed an interest\nin seeing debates between the renowned Stephen Douglass\nand an undistinguished lawyer by the name of Lincoln, the\nconcept merely sounded preposterous, but later, when the\nAtlanta papers reported that such debates were scheduled,\nColonel Brackett suddenly paid credence to those claims,\nand sent word to Atlanta to certain well-placed confidences.\nI had been out here for the last several weeks checking\nout his story. He wouldn\u2019t talk openly about the Douglass\n\u2013 Lincoln debates, which he insisted on referring\nto as the Lincoln \u2013 Douglass debates, slighting the\nesteemed popular souvereignist, or discuss any politics\nfor that matter, so we spent the time pursuing various schemes\nfor amassing a quick fortune.\nThe dining room was hotter, but the windows were opened,\nletting a slight breeze blow through, and the sun shining\nthrough the pecan grove just outside the window was a welcome\nchange from the parlour. After we had settled around the\ndining table, Bonds asked in a flat voice, \u201cHow about\nthe Pony Express? Have you heard any word about that?\u201d\nThe scent of fresh-baked bread filled the air and I didn\u2019t\npay him much mind. It was at least the third proposal he\nhad offered up this morning, and he sounded as guarded and\nuneasy as we felt. His days of freely expressing his opinions\nhad ended when a local thug who had been guarding him had\ngotten angry at something Bonds had said and beaten the\nbejebers out of him. Neither Bonds nor the bully had spoken\na word of what had caused the outburst. The ruffian was\ngone now, replaced by myself and the other men who filled\nthe room, but Bonds guarded what he said these days.\nTom and Robert exchanged glances then turned back to Bonds.\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe we can say we have heard\nof a pony express. Pray tell, what is that?\u201d I glanced\nover at William to confirm he was memorizing Bonds\u2019\nevery word, then turned back and scrutinized the man to\nassess whether he was fabricating the story from thin air.\n\u201cThe railroad, has it extended all the way to California\nyet?\u201d Bonds asked hesitantly.\n\u201cWhat? Heavens, no. I don\u2019t even know why anyone\nwould want to go to all the trouble to run a railway into\nthat territory.\u201d Tom had appointed himself as the\nprovocateur. We all waited to see if his ridicule might\nelicit any telling response. \u201cThough there was that\ngold rush back a few years?\u201d\nBonds only shook his head. He wasn\u2019t taking that bait.\n\u201cGood, the time frame may be just about right.\u201d\nSuddenly, his eyebrows sprang upwards. \u201cHave we purchased\nthe Alaskan territories yet?\u201d The blank looks on everyone\u2019s\nface must have supplied the answer.\n\u201cWhere is that?\u201d Robert gently probed.\n\u201cThe Russian territories up north of the Oregon Territory.\u201d\nBonds gave a dismissive wave of his fingertips. \u201cNever\nmind.\u201d\nI wondered how in the heck that tied in to what we were\ndiscussing.\n\u201cYou were asking about a pony express?\u201d Tom\nturned the conversation back towards what, hopefully, would\nprove to be a fruitful direction.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Perhaps that doesn\u2019t happen\nuntil after the ci-\u201d He suddenly had the look of a\nhaunted man. The broken sentence hung there, making us all\nuncomfortable.\nHis alarm made me uneasy. The abolitionist movement was\nmaking everyone jittery. The thought of Yankees forcing\nthrough emancipation of the Negroes seemed ridiculous. Thoughts\nof bleeding Kansas came to mind. All John Brown had accomplished,\nI mentally observed, was get himself killed and made the\npun of a derogatory ditty. No plantation owner would ever\nrelease his slaves. Still, I realized the course of events\nover the next few years would be delicate, to say the least.\nAny hint we garnered to better turn the tide of abolitionist\nfever could be invaluable. It was the reason we stayed here\ndelicately probing at Mr. Bonds\u2019 claims.\nThere were those who argued that we beat whatever knowledge\nBonds possessed from his recalcitrant lips. That would be\na futile act, I felt, as I still didn\u2019t believe the\nman was from the future, or that he could discern anything\nabout it. First off, the Douglass \u2013 Lincoln debates\nweren\u2019t for the Presidency like he had claimed, it\nwas for Congress. I took that as a sign that the man was\na fraud.\nIt was clear the Yankee had traveled well. He had inquired\nrepeatedly after a John D. Rockefeller. It had taken considerably\nresearch, but we had finally located a man of modest upbringing\nand little means with just that name, living in Cincinnati.\nHe claimed no knowledge of any Harold Bonds.\nFor a confidence man, Bonds was unusually shrewd, or exceedingly\nfoolish. What interest he might have in this Rockefeller\ngentleman, he wouldn\u2019t say. He had given no indication\nwhere we might find this Rockefeller and seemed to accept\nat face value our claim that he couldn\u2019t be located.\nUnless this other gentleman was simply a side ruse, Bonds\ndidn\u2019t seem to be advancing his scheme effectively.\nAt the same time, he maintained a fa\u00e7ade of professed\nignorance of our culture, thereby supporting a serviceable\nclaim to being planted into what was for him an historical\nperiod. The lack of familiarity he displayed was what unnerved\nme. His casual ignorance of the most mundane minutia of\neveryday life seemed impossible to maintain convincingly,\nyet he had held us here for weeks. We still hadn\u2019t\nbeen able to conclusively pierce his deception.\nI forked a slice of cold ham onto my supper plate, already\nladen with collard greens, black eyed peas and fried crook-necked\nsquash, and grabbed a thick slice of fresh-baked bread,\nthen sat back to enjoy the mid-day meal and study my subject\nsome more.\nAs I cut my ham steak with my knife, I asked, \u201cSo,\nwhat about this pony express, anyway?\u201d\nWithout pausing to swallow, he began to speak. Even after\nall these weeks, he displayed atrocious manners, seemingly\nunaware of his lack of etiquette.\n\u201cDon\u2019t know much, really. But it was a really\nbig deal. I seem to recall that there were many investors.\nIt might be easy to get in on the venture.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what did this pony express do?\u201d\n\u201cIt delivered letters all the way from the Atlantic\nto the Pacific in just a few days.\u201d He noted the looks\nof incredibility about the room as he shoveled another forkful\ninto his mouth and nodded.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. Set up way-stations clear across\nthe western frontier. Young riders would switch onto fresh\nmounts and just keep on riding, then pass their saddlebags\nfull of letters to another when they finally stopped.\u201d\nSuch a scheme would convey information weeks, even months\nearlier. That was one of the first things he had spoken\nabout that made any sense to me. It wasn\u2019t like that\nautomobile business, or worse that aeroplane idea he had\npushed for weeks. I told him as much.\nThere were guffaws around the table. The Negress who had\ncalled us into supper was going around the table and serving\nglasses of cool well water. I saw her lips twitch into a\ngrin also. She looked real nice when she smiled.\n\u201cFly, to Europe!\u201d James snorted.\n\u201cHell, why stop there?\u201d Tom exclaimed. \u201cWhy\nnot fly all the way to the moon?\u201d There was another\nburst of laughter and merriment.\n\u201cAh, I see someone has been reading Wells?\u201d\nBonds asked. The remark was one of those unguarded outbursts\nthat we stove to pry from him.\n\u201cWho?\u201d Tom asked.\n\u201cWells, H.G. Wells.\u201d Bonds looked around the\ntable at blank faces, and his grin faded. I noticed that\nWilliam was committing the name to memory, so investigators\ncould look up this fellow.\n\u201cWho is this Wells?\u201d I asked gently.\n\u201cNobody, just a novelist. He wrote an amusing novel\nabout men flying to the moon. I thought you were referring\nto that.\u201d\nAh, that explained it, I thought. We all laughed at the\nconcept of men traveling to the moon. I wondered if the\nname would prove valid. Once William included it in his\nnext report, agents would scour the literary field for an\nH.G. Wells. About a third of the names we got him to drop\nchecked out. I had no idea what that proved.\nA nudge at my elbow distracted me from the conversation.\nThe Negress stood there with the pitcher of water.\n\u201cPlease, pour,\u201d I directed and nodded towards\nmy glass. As she leaned forward to fill my glass, her scent\noverpowered my thoughts. I slipped my arm around her waist\nand gave her derriere an affectionate rub. I definitely\nhoped we had come to an understanding. She pulled back abruptly\nand pulled away from my embrace. She was a spirited filly.\nI decided I might have to enlist the support of Colonel\nBrackett to get her to cooperate.\nThat might be expensive, but well worth the cost, I speculated,\nas I watched her march back towards the kitchen. I was grinning\nas I turned back towards the supper conversation. Bonds\nwas favoring me with a stern frown.\nI wondered what I had just said to disturb him. When he\nglanced at the retreating back of the Negress, I realized\nhe didn\u2019t approve of my sport. His ire puzzled me.\nI knew the man paid little attention to the gospel. He hadn\u2019t\nattended a single Sunday service in all the time I had been\nwith him, or inquired about such matters. Indeed, he seemed\nto studiously avoid the subject of religion. So he wasn\u2019t\nany holier than thou bible thumper worried about carnal\nsin.\n\u201cYou planning on making a play for her yourself?\u201d\nI asked. Maybe he already had, I reasoned, perhaps I was\ntrespassing upon his private playground. If so, I speculated,\nI might use it to pry a wedge into his dispassionate reserve.\nI glanced behind my shoulder, but the Negress had disappeared\nthrough the kitchen door.\n\u201cSir, forcing yourself upon someone who is trapped\nin bondage is hardly civilized behavior.\u201d The ice\nin his voice made clear that my first guess was wide of\nthe mark.\n\u201cForce myself?\u201d I displayed exaggerated umbrage\nat his remark in order to goad him. \u201cI have never\nhad occasion to force myself upon anyone. I make sure any\nwoman who shares my bed enjoys herself, even a nigger.\u201d\nI felt my cheeks warm over my frank works in such a refined\nsetting, but reminded myself that no ladies were present.\nI stuck my chin out and dared him to push the subject. I\ncould see the others in the room shift in their chairs,\nawaiting whatever outburst I could draw from him. He glared\nat me, then locked his jaw and let out a shuddering breath.\nAfter that, the conversation sputtered. After dining, we\nwandered out onto the veranda. A breeze knocked down the\nworst of the later summer heat, but the humidity bore down\nupon us all like a millstone. The enthusiasm we had shown\nfor our discussion this morning sweated right out of us.\nEven the anger from the exchange at supper was bludgeoned\ninto submission. A couple of the men drew forth cigars and\nlit up. The fragrance of fine tobacco soon filled the air.\n\u201cWhat I wouldn\u2019t give for a good air conditioner,\u201d\nBonds lamented. We had already been down that discussion\na number of times. No one showed the vitality to pursue\nit once more. He claimed that lack of practical knowledge\nof compressor design, that and his confound electricity,\nkept him from making a fortune in air conditioning. His\nclaim that he could draw cold air from the muggy heat was\none of the reasons I didn\u2019t believe his fantastic\nstories.\n\u201cIf it is so much better back where you come from,\nwhy don\u2019t you just conjure up one of them there time\nfunnels made by that Professor Marion Beasley and go back?\u201d\nI could tell Tom didn\u2019t really have his heart into\nhis effort to goad Bonds. Undoubtedly, that was one of the\nreasons he chose such a tired old subject to kick around\nonce more.\n\u201cTemporal terminus.\u201d I had to hand it to Bonds,\nhe remained consistent with his four-bit words. He claimed\nthese terminals were like the ends of a lightning bolt striking\nacross time, except being struck snapped you to the other\nend of the bolt.\n\u201cBelieve me, if I could do so, and had any hope of\ncreating a temporal arc pointed the correct direction in\ntime, I would. But we don\u2019t even have electricity,\nI can\u2019t build a linear accelerator on my own, and\nfrankly, despite all my work on the project, I don\u2019t\nreally understand M theory well enough.\u201d As he reached\nthe end of his outburst, Bonds\u2019 voice pitched into\na shrill whine.\n\u201cBut you carelessly let yourself enter one of these\ntime terminals created by Beasley\u2019s physics experiments?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t allow any such thing. I was swept\naway unexpectedly. It was at least six months before the\nhardware was to be ready for the first tests, but the dust\ndevil that blundered across my path on the way to the lab\nmust have come from that experiment.\u201d\n\u201cAnd when you realized the phenomenon had whisked\nyou back in time, you tried to return back to your own time\nperiod by re-entering the funnel, but instead or returning\nforward in time, you jumped back even further, back to this\ntime and place.\u201d Jack was intentionally cutting this\ndiscussion short. I couldn\u2019t blame him. We had gone\nover this too many times already.\nBonds tilted his head and just stared back. After a while,\nI said I was going back inside. It was debatable whether\nit was hotter inside, but I thought I would wander back\ninto the kitchen and firm up my expectations with the Negress.\nI let the screen slam shut behind me as I disappeared back\ninto the dark interior of the mansion.\nI found the girl standing at the sink with her back to me,\nscrubbing dishes.\n\u201cRufus!\u201d she called out the screen door. Then\nmuttered under her breath, \u201cWhere is that boy when\nhe\u2019s needed?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps I could be of service?\u201d I offered.\nWhen she twirled about, I bowed low in mock formality. I\nfound a touch of respect always went a long way in garnering\na nigger girl\u2019s affections.\n\u201cOh sir, sorry sir. I was just callin\u2019 Rufus\nto fetch me a pail of rinse water for these here dishes,\u201d\nshe explained as she wiped suds from her hands onto a towel.\n\u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d\n\u201cPlease, let me help, or don\u2019t you think I\u2019m\nstrong enough to fetch a pail of water?\u201d I grabbed\nthe pail as I spoke then paused to slip off my jacket and\nroll up my sleeves while grinning at the girl.\n\u201cI can\u2019t ask you to fetch for me!\u201d She\ndimpled as she spoke.\n\u201cWell now, I reckon not. But there ain\u2019t nothing\nagainst me going and fetching myself a cool pail of water\nfrom the well to get a drink. If you dispense with the leftover\nwater afterwards by using it as rinse water, who\u2019s\nto say otherwise?\u201d I left her standing bemused at\nmy gallantry and sauntered out across the yard to the well.\nAs I reentered the kitchen, I carried the pail well out\nto my side. I had made sure it was full to brimming. I tensed\nmy abdomen and swung the pail onto the counter with the\nbest display of ease I could muster.\n\u201cLet me fetch a glass for you,\u201d she said. Her\neyes sparkled.\n\u201cYour name\u2019s Ruth, is that right?\u201d Though\nwe referred to the servants as girl or boy, I had made sure\nI knew her name beforehand. I watched her respond with pleasure\nat my use of it.\n\u201cYessir, from the bible.\u201d\n\u201cRuth, perhaps you could provide my room with a fresh\npitcher of cool water after we all retire this evening?\u201d\nI leaned forward slightly as I made the suggestion.\nI watched her bosom swell as she leaned away. \u201cWhy,\nI don\u2019t know if that would be quite proper.\u201d\nHer voice held a hint of scandal, but her eyes revealed\nher interest.\n\u201cWell, I have a present for you, but I don\u2019t\nthink it would be proper to prance it out in front of everyone,\nnow do you?\u201d\n\u201cA present? What is it?\u201d Her quick interest\nwas satisfying.\n\u201cWell, at first I thought I might purchase a store-bought\nSunday dress, but I wouldn\u2019t know how to get the size\nright.\u201d She swatted her hand through the air at the\nthought of a man properly selecting a dress for a woman.\n\u201cThen I thought I might get you a nice little bit\nof jewelry, but then someone might accuse you of stealin\u2019;\nbesides, I haven\u2019t made it to the general store for\nsome time. So I thought I might just offer you a two-dollar\ngold piece, and let you go pick out your own dress.\u201d\nAt the mention of money I saw her eyes brighten, then she\nleaned forward.\n\u201cA two-dollar gold piece?\u201d she asked hesitantly\nas she placed her spread palms against her ribcage. I could\nsee she was wondering whether she dared try to squeeze any\nmore from the negotiations. She took a deep breath that\npulled my eyes to her breasts.\n\u201cAnd I will add another two bits for a pretty sash\nto go with that dress.\u201d\n\u201cYes sir, after the household retires. I\u2019ll\nsurely fetch you a pitcher.\u201d I let my eyes wander\ndown her delicate form, taking in her fine young shape.\nI could feel a grin spread across my face.\n\u201cYou jerk.\u201d I spun about at Bonds\u2019 statement.\nIntent upon the girl, I had missed his arrival.\n\u201cDo you have no shame at all? Forcing sexual favors\nfrom a slave.\u201d Bonds\u2019 face flushed; his hands\nclenched.\n\u201cYou sir, are out of line,\u201d I declared. I realized\nhis outburst could jeopardize the agreement I had just reached.\nIt had been a long season out here listening to his claims\nand I was tired of his games.\n\u201cAnd you are immoral.\u201d His tirade would surely\ndraw a crowd. The girl rushed past and out of the room.\nI resisted the urge to reach out and pull her back.\n\u201cWhat, you a bleedin\u2019 abolitionist?\u201d I\nsqueezed all the venom into the words that I could muster.\n\u201cWhat the hell does some Negress mean to you?\u201d\nI watch his teeth grind for a few seconds.\n\u201cYou bigoted prick.\u201d He marched forward with\nhis finger aimed at my face like a sabre. \u201cFor your\ninfo, one of my father\u2019s ancestors was half Native\nAmerican and half African American, and my mother\u2019s\nfamily is Jewish. Care to make any other cracks?\u201d\nI stood before him befuddled for a few moments as I reasoned\nout his comments. \u201cYou\u2019re a mulatto, a Hebrew\nand a what?\u201d I began to snicker then broke out into\nloud guffaws as I realized the parentage of the illegitimate\nman before me who had commanded my attention these long\nweeks. Tears squeezed from my eyes and I clutched my stomach\nwith my right hand as I bent over from the pain from laughing\nso hard. Realizing that I still had a job to do and needed\nto humor him, I held out the palm of my left hand towards\nhim and tried to gather my composure. He slapped it aside.\n\u201cThe Emancipation Proclamation, issued by President\nAbraham Lincoln frees the slaves, you haughty prick. That\ngirl will be a free woman before she\u2019s married. Your\nprecious south loses the Civil War and is overrun by northerners\nthat pillage everything that isn\u2019t torched in the\nwar.\u201d Bonds turned his face towards the doorway into\nthe kitchen. The crew all crowded about.\n\u201cYou getting all this, William?\u201d he snapped.\nTurning back, he spat at me. \u201cGeneral Sherman will\ntorch your precious plantations and your mansions to the\nground.\u201d He gestured around him as he spoke.\n\u201cUlysses S. Grant forces Robert E Lee to surrender\nthe Confederate forces to the Union at Appomattox. With\nthe end of slavery and the collapse of the plantations,\nthe south becomes synonymous with ignorance and poverty.\nSouthern bigots like you --\u201d Bonds staggered then\ncollapsed to the floor, clutched at his stomach and fell\nstill. Bright red blood began to pool on the floor.\nI realized I had shot him. Tom approached and removed the\npistol from my grip. I looked up at everyone as they gathered\naround the body. The scents of blood and gunpowder filled\nmy nostrils.\n\u201cDamn shame you had to have a modern revolver. Not\nlikely he\u2019ll survive five shots to the gut,\u201d\nJack observed dryly. It was the first I realized I had emptied\nmy pistol.\nAs I looked about the circle of faces, I realized the gravity\nof my situation. I cleared my throat but had no idea what\nto say.\n\u201cAs demented as could be,\u201d William declared.\n\u201cA swindler, pure and clear,\u201d Robert argued.\n\u201cA cheat.\u201d\n\u201cA flimflam. I never heard a taller story in all my\nlife.\u201d Tom looked around at all of us. \u201cIt looks\nlike we\u2019re in agreement. Shame that he went for your\npistol when we caught him out. Clearly self defense.\u201d\nHe handed my revolver back to me. I remained rooted in place.\nTom looked around at the crew.\n\u201cOur work here is over. I\u2019ll be heading back\nto Atlanta in the morning to report. Ya\u2019ll can leave\nwhen you see fit. No use any of you spreading any of those\nlies he was telling, understood?\u201d Everyone else nodded,\nthen shuffled out. Tom turned back to me.\n\u201cYou shot him, you see to his burial.\u201d he turned\nand left me alone with the body.\nOf course, I realized, it was all lunacy, every word of\nit. Except, I suspected that his words would be spread throughout\nthe plantation by mornin\u2019 and halfway to Atlanta by\nthe end of the month. I had noticed a blackie scurry down\nthe hallway past the door right after Tom had removed the\npistol from my hand.\nNonsense, but it would give false expectation among the\nniggers during a time when we didn\u2019t need it. This\nabolitionist fever would be tough to ride out until it blew\nover.\nI thought I might head back to North Carolina and see how\nmy folks were doin\u2019. They had a modest plantation.\nI might make it back in time to help finish the harvest.\nThe image flashed through my thoughts of young men racing\nacross the western wilderness on sturdy mounts. In their\nsaddlebags nestled letters announcing the end to a Civil\nWar between northern Yankees and southern Confederates.\nNonsense, I told myself.\nNonsense, but I resolved to sink my life savings into his\npony express if it came about. We would see who would have\nthe last word.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050905180510\/http:\/\/wouldthatitwere.com\/julysept2004\/ponyexpress.htm","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/9jhOaVSDYBPK38kDFHHDghoktBY.json","volume":5.0,"issues":2.0,"has_text":true}

The gray haze of a chilly\nday obscured some of the worst details of the crumbling\nbuilding. Little Billy knocked with a ham-sized fist in\nhuge gloves, the taps oddly delicate. He looked around,\nnoting the smoky fires of vagrants in front of ruined buildings,\nthe ugly remnant of London\u2019s lowest side. He glanced again\nat the note Mum had brought to him in the wooden tray she\nreserved for less-than-gentleman\u2019s missives. He mumbled\nsomething to himself and checked the sooty walls nearby\nfor a clue to 11 Cardinal Way. A quick gusty \u201cHmph\u201d was\nall he could muster, so he knocked again.\nThis time the door opened\nand a wispy man, white frantic hair above washed-out blue\neyes stood in the doorway. The floor beyond him was filthy,\npiled with assorted knick-knacks and wooden crates, the\ndust thick enough to be settling after its recent disturbance.\n\u201cWilliam? William Mayfair?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Cuthbert? Is that you?\u201d\nAn ugly chuckle emerged from\nparched lips. \u201cYou cannot say I haven\u2019t changed in all these\nyears. How long has it been? Twelve, thirteen years?\u201d\nLittle Billy took a second\nto respond. \u201cAlmost fourteen, really, Andrew. I was very\nsurprised to receive your message.\u201d\nCuthbert stepped back and\nwaved a spindly arm as if royalty stood before him. \u201cYes.\nPlease step into my humble manse, if you will. Pardon the\nmess as I can no longer afford a housekeeper and my talents\ndo not exactly lie in the direction of mere organization.\u201d\nHe gave another ugly chuckle as Little Billy moved silently\ninto the hallway. He noticed the walls were stained, possibly\nby fungus, and that the interior felt damp on his face.\nCuthbert closed the door\nand raised a hand to cut off the other man\u2019s words. \u201cPlease.\nFollow me to my studio and I will answer your questions.\u201d\nHe hesitated a moment and then laid a gnarled hand on Billy\u2019s\nmassive shoulder. Cuthbert\u2019s face softened and the deep\nlines faded so that youth seemed to emerge. \u201cI thank you\nfor coming. It means much to me.\u201d\nLittle Billy blinked. \u201cYour\nwelcome, Andrew. You did say I was the only person who would\nappreciate what you were doing so I felt comp\u2014\u201c\n\u201cCompelled by curiosity?\u201d\ncackled Cuthbert, his face wrinkling into itself again.\nHe started to cough, a wet phlegmy cough that quickly escalated\ninto whooping breaths. Little Billy grabbed Cuthbert\u2019s arm\nto steady him and was shocked to feel but skin and bone,\nas fragile as if grasping a bird.\nCuthbert halted the spasms\nas if by an act of sheer will. He pushed Little Billy\u2019s\narm away and drew himself up, barely increasing his stooped\nposture. \u201cYou are here, at my behest. Time flies and we\nhave much to discuss. Come.\u201d With a shuffling, limping gait,\nCuthbert moved down the hallway into the darker gloom within.\nCHAPTER\n2\nCuthbert\u2019s studio was a large\nill-shaped room that may have been parts of other rooms,\nas traces of walls and doors remained scattered across its\nfloor. The ceiling was high, almost thirty feet, and the\nfew windows that were not covered by cloth or paper were\nfilthy. Dust seemed to float like fog. The room was dominated\nby a large organ-like instrument, shiny golden pipes atop\na rectangular box reaching high in a steadily rising series,\nlowest on the left. The front of the instrument, if that\nwas its function, had holes of different sizes, arranged\nin staggered lines of nine, seven, five and three from top\nto bottom. A long bench faced the instrument.\nAround it were arranged a\ntable, two rickety chairs and a narrow cot, covered with\na blanket. Scraps of food on dented tin plates covered table\nand chairs, a chamber pot resting beneath the cot. Papers\nwere scattered everywhere, and as Little Billy took this\nin, a large rat ran over to steal a scrap from beneath the\ntable.\nCuthbert followed Billy\u2019s\neyes and chuckled again. \u201cMarion is her name. Quite bold,\nshe is.\u201d\nLittle Billy showed the note.\n\u201cWhy am I here?\u201d he asked softly. He took off his coat and\ngloves, glanced around and settled on holding them.\nCuthbert clapped his hands\nonce. \u201cCome. Sit.\u201d He cleared a chair with one sweep of\nhis arm, food and plates flying onto the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s sturdier\nthan it looks. Sit.\u201d He turned and pulled the bench away\nfrom the instrument, sat on it and leaned forward, his eyes\nshining as if reflecting a full moon.\nLittle Billy sat gingerly,\narranging his coat and gloves on his lap. \u201cI am all ears,\nAndrew.\u201d\nCuthbert raised a hand. \u201cIt\nwas \u2018Andy\u2019 once. Why \u2018Andrew\u2019 now?\u201d His face seemed eager,\nas if a weasel spying fowls.\nLittle Billy shrugged. \u201cWe\nwere much younger then, almost children. We have progressed\nbeyond that and \u2018Andrew\u2019 is most appropriate. Would you\nrather I call you \u2018Andy\u2019?\nCuthbert shuddered. \u201cNo!\n\u2018Andrew\u2019 is fine. It\u2019s just that\u2026\u201d He looked away and once\nagain the lines on his face faded and a trace of a mischievous\nyouth, bright-eyed and smiling, came through. They disappeared\nin a blink. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I knew you were the person to\nwrite to. You were always miles ahead of us in grasping\nthe essence of things. I have made an excellent selection.\u201d\nHe smiled with open pride. \u201cYes, an excellent selection.\u201d\nLittle Billy let the smile\nfade. \u201cHow may I help you?\u201d\nCuthbert reacted as if stung.\n\u201cHelp? Help me? Do you believe I asked you here to impinge\non your person? After all these years?\u201d He seemed on the\nverge of apoplexy.\nLittle Billy raised his hands,\nas if in offering. \u201cAndrew, what else was I to think? You\ndropped from our sights almost fourteen years ago. We heard\nyou had spent your wealth in travels abroad and in sundry\npurchases that were later lost when your mansion was sold.\u201d\nLittle Billy paused, blushing furiously at the implication\nof debt upon a gentleman.\nCuthbert waved a hand deprecatingly.\n\u201cWhat else was said?\u201d\nLittle Billy set his jaw.\n\u201cForgive my bluntness, but it was said you had taken leave\nof your senses, that you had been sent to a spa in Austria\nto settle your nerves.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cWe thought\nyou would be found dead, or had already died in some forgotten\nroom.\u201d\nCuthbert nodded his head\ngently, his smile a freezing line. \u201cI was forgotten by\nalmost all of you, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d\nLittle Billy nodded.\n\u201cAnd you?\u201d\nA deep breath and a soft\nvoice. \u201cEven I.\u201d\nCuthbert laughed in a snarling,\nstaccato fashion. \u201cWilliam, you were always forthright,\neven to the point of embarrassment. And yet, diplomatic\nat the same time.\u201d The laughter faded into a cough that\nwas halted with difficulty.\n\u201cCan I get you something?\nA potion or tincture to help you with that cough?\u201d\nCuthbert raised a hand. \u201cNo,\nmy friend, there is no need. I will have the wherewithal\nto deal with this malady very soon.\u201d He hacked and then\nspit a phlegmy wad upon the floor. \u201cTime is of the esssence\nand the day grows short. Let me begin.\u201d\nThe shadows deepened and\ndespite the chill, beads of sweat bedewed Cuthbert\u2019s forehead.\nCHAPTER\n3\nLooking at some distant point\nabove Little Billy\u2019s head, Cuthbert spoke in a whispery\nvoice. \u201cI did disappear, as you said, for I had lost the\ndesire to waste my time in petty social calls and mindless\nactivity.\u201d He raised a hand. \u201cNo. Let me speak. You were\nthe only person I missed, the only one I truly missed in\nmy days as a wanderer. At first, I traveled to see the sights\nthat others had spoken to me of, and I did that to get my\ntake on them. I thus relieved myself of their insipid and\nstunted views.\u201d Cuthbert looked directly at Little Billy.\n\u201cI discovered that they were fools, all of them, incapable\nof seeing beyond the surface into the true essence of things.\nI returned time and again to my memories of you, and your\nway of studying what was placed before you and how you loved\nto explore the universe around you as if the answers were\nalways within your grasp.\u201d His eyes focused on the massive\nman. \u201cI envied you. In a kind way, but envy none the same.\nAnd I wanted to be like you.\u201d\nLittle Billy started to say\nsomething but Cuthbert lay a hand on his knee and squeezed.\nThe grip was surprisingly strong. \u201cPlease. I need to say\nthese things, as I have rehearsed them time and time again.\nIt will not take long, I assure you.\u201d He leaned back and\ntook a deep, raspy breath.\n\u201cIn a quiet place just south\nof Innsbruck, I came across some documents that hinted at\nthe method the ancient Egyptians used to build their pyramid\ntombs.\u201d\n\u201cEgypt?\u201d\nCuthbert smiled as if to\na child. \u201cYes, William, the empire of the Nile. You are,\nof course, familiar with their great pyramids, huge mounds\nof stones weighing hundreds of tons? Structures that defy\neven our greatest engineers to reproduce? And as no one\nhas yet deciphered their strange pictogrammatic language,\nwe are left without a clue as to how these massive deeds\nwere accomplished.\u201d\n\u201cBut the Rosetta Stone has\u2014\u201c\n\u201cNo. The Stone lets us compare\nEgyptian to ancient Greek, but it merely details a simple\ntransaction. Nowhere have we found a description of the\nprocess used to create these strange monstrosities. But\nbuild them they did, and the knowledge that was once common\nenough to create a dynasty has been lost in time.\u201d Cuthbert\ngave another ugly chuckle. \u201cOr has it?\u201d\nLittle Billy stared. \u201cYou\nhave the answer.\u201d\nCuthbert\u2019s face sagged into\nitself and his eyes blazed with fury, his face a stone mask.\nLittle Billy skipped a breath, watching carefully.\nThe mask softened and a normal\nlight returned to the faded blue eyes. \u201cA lamp! We now need\na lamp!\u201d cried Cuthbert, quickly scuttling around table\nand chairs to light two oil lamps. Shadows leaped across\nthe large room, disguising age and revealing sorrow.\nSeated upon the bench, Cuthbert\ncontinued. \u201cYes, I have. It is this.\u201d He pointed over his\nshoulder at the organ-like instrument. The frenzied glow\nreturned to eyes that seemed to shrink and expand in the\nmuted light. \u201cAnd in a few minutes, only you and I will\nknow the secret.\u201d A sound like a chuckle. \u201cOnly you and\nI.\u201d\nCHAPTER\n4\n\u201cIt took me years, many years,\nto piece together the trail that leads to this. From faded\ndocuments in Innsbruck through bazaars in Istanbul, basements\nin Paris, a castle in Northern Italy, wretched caves in\nPersia, a tomb in Mesopotamia, a temple in Nepal and filthy\nmud huts in Ethiopia, in all of these and more I followed\na trail no other man could see. None! It was there, bright\nas day to me, but lost in mists to mere mortals.\u201d Cuthbert\nwas standing now, his thin body arching upward in conquest.\n\u201cI nearly died a dozen times, maybe more for I knew not\nwho was my enemy and who might have been following me. I\nspent all my money, stole more and spent that too, and at\na crucial point in my quest, languishing in prison, I bartered\nwhat I knew for a silver piece and escape.\u201d\n\u201cSo you had help from someone\nto complete your search?\u201d\nCuthbert\u2019s gaze pierced Little\nBilly. \u201cHe was dead before the final moment.\u201d There was\nlittle doubt about what was left unsaid.\nLittle Billy stared at the\nwizened figure, noting his defiant stance. \u201cAnd what did\nyou gain for all this\u2026effort?\u201d he asked in a quiet voice.\nCuthbert seemed to grow in\nstature, vanity incarnate. \u201cThis!\u201d he pointed to the pipe-laden\ninstrument. \u201cThe secret of the Pharoahs! The magnificent\ncreation that built the glorious pyramids!\u201d\nHe scuttled around the bench\nand put a loving hand on the instrument\u2019s sturdy side. \u201cThis\nis what I knew that no other man could see. I took one tiny\nclue, a sliver of Truth, and followed it relentlessly to\nits brilliant conclusion!\u201d Cuthbert\u2019s voice rose until it\ncracked, a coughing spasm wracking his withered body as\na storm shakes a twig.\nThe ponderous body stood\nup slowly. He waited for the coughing to end, then: \u201cI must\nsay, Cuthbert, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. The\npyramids were obviously built by slave labor, not by a pipe\norgan, if that\u2019s what that artifact is.\u201d\nCuthbert\u2019s eyes slitted to\ndaggers, his lips compressing until they almost disappeared\nin the wrinkled visage. \u201cOf course you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m\ntalking about! You are but one of many fools who cannot\nimagine that I, I Cuthbert of the broken past, could ever\ndiscover such a stunning secret. But you are a lesser fool\nby far than the rest, and that is why I have asked you here.\nYou were always willing to follow the facts.\u201d\n\u201cI see no facts of your claim,\nonly wood and metal.\u201d\nCuthbert\u2019s smile was reptilian,\ncold and harsh. \u201cCome. See the rest.\u201d He pointed to the\nspace behind the instrument and Little Billy followed.\nA large pendulum hung from\nthe highest rafter, connected high up by horizontal rods\nto two weights on either side, one resting on a bellow,\nthe other hanging above a second bellow. Cuthbert lay a\nhand on the pendulum and gave it a small push. It barely\nmoved.\n\u201cBill, would you do me the\nhonor of setting this into motion?\u201d\nLittle Billy stepped up to\nthe pendulum and pushed it with one hand. It moved but inches.\nEyes agape, he turned to Cuthbert who chuckled wetly. \u201cLead.\nVery heavy, you know. Try harder.\u201d\nThe huge man set both hands\non the pendulum\u2019s shaft and pushed with a heave of his strong\nback and legs. The pendulum rose a couple of feet, and using\nits momentum, Little Billy pushed it the other direction,\nagain and again, until the motion was constant, whipping\nviolently back and forth and the bellows gushed air into\nthe instrument. A low thrumming emerged from the pipes above.\nCuthbert claped his hands.\n\u201cExcellent! The Egyptians used slaves to keep their bellows\nworking, but I cannot afford slaves. \u201c A pause. \u201cYet.\u201d\nLittle Billy pulled a linen\nhandkerchief from his vest pocket and wiped his hands. \u201cBad\ntaste, old man. Deuced bad taste.\u201d\nWith a wave of his hand,\nCuthbert dismissed the criticism. \u201cIt\u2019s what I have left,\nor not, I\u2019m not sure.\u201d He walked around the instrument and\nsat at the bench. Little Billy stood to his right, focused\non Cuthbert\u2019s actions.\nThe thrumming grew slightly\nlouder and Little Billy could feel it against his right\nshoulder as he leaned slightly on the instrument. Cuthbert\ntook a deep breath and began speaking in a soft monotone.\n\u201cTo build the pyramids was\na physical impossibility. No amount of human strength could\nwrest those gigantic blocks from their quarries and mason\nfields and place them one upon the other reaching hundreds\nof feet into the air. No theory ever advanced can explain\nthe building considering the sheer weight of rock and the\nlack of a true wheeled system for conveyance. No theory\never explained to satisfaction the method by which these\ngigantic blocks were raised and placed to exquisite precision.\u201d\nCuthbert coughed slightly, holding himself\nin against another spasm. He continued, his voice rising.\n\u201cNo, no theory, even one considering the efforts of thousands\nof men laboring hours to place one stone at a time. The\nbest theory would have the Great Pyramid of Giza built over\na period of 150 years! Think of that! They would have you\nbelieve that the tomb of one Pharoah was being built several\npharoahs into the future! Preposterous!\u201d He stared at Little\nBilly.\n\u201cAnd yet there it is, there they are.\nPyramids that defy explanation.\u201d\n\u201cExcept to me.\u201d Cuthbert stood up. \u201cI\nknow how they were built.\u201d He stared again at Little Billy,\neyes gleaming in the flickering light.\nLittle Billy counted to ten, then ten\nmore. \u201cYou would have me ask, no?\u201d\nCuthbert nodded, a beatific smile on\nhis face.\nWith a grunt: \u201cCuthbert, how were they\nbuilt?\u201d\nIn answer, Cuthbert turned and placed\na hand over one of the holes of the instrument. A low hollow\nhum emerged from the pipes above, changing in pitch as he\nmoved his hand closer and farther away. Staring somewhere\nin space he could only see, Cuthbert said: \u201cThey built the\npyramids with sound.\u201d\nCHAPTER\n5\nLittle Billy bit back an\nexpostulation. \u201cSound, Cuthbert?\u201d\nCuthbert returned to the\ndingy room. \u201cSound, I said.\u201d He pulled himself erect. \u201cThe\nEgyptians knew the power of harmonic convergence to move\nmatter.\u201d\nLittle Billy\u2019s jaw dropped\nopen, then shut with a click. \u201cYou tossed away your fortune\non a crackpot theory?\u201d\nCuthbert erupted. \u201cNo! It\nis not a crackpot theory! I know! I KNOW!\u201d he shrieked,\nhis hands like talons and spittle flying.\nLittle Billy surprised himself\nby taking a step backwards. \u201cEasy, old chap. Forgive my\nbluntness, but you must be aware that harmonic convergence\nis but a myth, an old wives\u2019 tale that ran through Science\nand was chased away by Reason.\u201d\nCuthbert was breathing heavily.\n\u201cAnd that is proof enough for you? What unnamed others have\nopined?\u201d\nLittle Billy\u2019s brow darkened.\n\u201cThese are men of Science, disciplined and erudite. What\nhave you against their proof?\u201d\nCuthbert smiled, like a fallen\nangel. \u201cAh. We shall cut short the lecture and proceed to\nthe demonstration. You force my hand, don\u2019t you know. Force\nit indeed.\u201d He turned to the instrument and after a brief\npause, he placed his hands over the holes, seemingly at\nrandom. The pendulum swayed back and forth, the bellows\ndelivering their gulps of air steady as clockwork. The thrumming\nrose and fell, the sounds swooping through the lamplit room\nlike heavy birds of prey. Little Billy watched, his intensity\nfading into pity as Cuthbert worked harder and harder, moving\nhis hands from one hole to another, changing sounds and\npitches until he reached a maniacal speed, sweat flying\nfrom his wrinkled brow.\nAnd then it happened. Deep\nin his stomach, Little Billy felt a vibration, as if something\nalive were quivering in his entrails. He placed a meaty\nhand over the source and felt the vibration through his\nskin, on his now-sweaty palm. The vibration grew quickly,\nhammering at his ribs and sternum, shaking his innards like\na dog shakes a bone. As he opened his mouth to speak, his\nbody was wracked by shudders that had nothing to do with\nthe chilly air.\nAnd with gentle grace, Little\nBilly started rising into the air. Inch by inch, steadily\nas smoke, he drifted farther away from the floor. Two feet.\nThree feet. Four, five then six. Try as he might, he couldn\u2019t\nspeak. An unknown form of terror gripped his heart, his\nmind, his very soul and demanded that he scream, but his\nvoice was trapped by the intensity of the experience. Seven,\neight, nine\u2026 He looked up, the once-distant ceiling now\nalmost within reach and his terror grew. Little Billy had\nnever really experienced fear, brawny and bold since infancy.\nBut this was beyond terror, this was madness and he shrank\nfrom it like a lamb from a lion.\nSuddenly, Cuthbert slowed\nhis hands and almost immediately, Little Billy began drifting\ndownward. The descent was quick, taking but a few seconds,\nbut it seemed like another eternity to both men. Dropping\nheavily the final foot, Little Billy collapsed on the bench,\nhis heart thudding like a trapped rabbit and watched as\nCuthbert slumped over the instrument, his body wracked by\ndeep phlegmy heaves, his face and hands bloodlessly pale.\nMany minutes passed before\neither man could speak. Little Billy gathered himself and\nwent over to Cuthbert, who was still breathing heavily.\nHe sat the frail man down and found the thin blanket with\nwhich to cover his sweaty frame. He looked around for something\nto drink and found a pitcher of cloudy water, poured a cup\nfor Cuthbert and gave it him. Cuthbert sipped and nodded\nhis thanks.\n\u201cCan you talk?\u201d\nCuthbert nodded, sipping\ngently.\nDozens of questions raced\nthrough Little Billy\u2019s mind. In the end, only one emerged:\n\u201cHow?\u201d\nCuthbert smiled wearily.\n\u201cHarmonic\u2026convergence. Vibrating at the exact frequency\nas matter and changing its properties. Making it malleable\nto heretofore invisible forces. Such as the mind.\u201d\nMore questions, and selecting\none. \u201cAny mind?\u201d\nAnother smile, more like\na grin. \u201cA trained mind.\u201d\n\u201cAt the risk of repeating\nmyself, how? By whom?\u201d\nCuthbert finished the cup\nof water. \u2018Myself, by trial and error.\u201d Noticing Little\nBilly\u2019s reaction, he raised a hand to stop him. \u201cI knew\nit was possible. Once the Egyptian priesthood had done this\nand kept it a closely-guarded secret, never making reference\nto it as it was the great source of their power. Having\na destination I merely needed a path to it. I obviously\nfound it.\u201d\nLittle Billy let the silence\nexpand. \u201cWhat else can you move?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cStones, wood and metals.\nEspecially metals. Now humans.\u201d An ugy chuckle.\n\u201c\u2019Now\u2019?! I was your first\nvictim of this\u2014this proof?\u201d\nCuthbert cackled. \u201c\u2019Victim\u2019\nyou say. Well, not entirely true, but yes, my first harmonic\nlevitation of a man. What did it feel like?\u201d\nLittle Billy shrugged and\nturned away. He paced the room, a lumbering bear in search\nof an escape. \u201cWhat now? When will you publish?\u201d\nThe wizened man stood up.\n\u201cPublish? I rather think not. This is not to be paraded\nbefore the unconscious and the foolish. I have my own plans.\u201d\nA lengthy pause. \u201cI have a fortune to recover and my time\ngrows short.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nCuthbert glanced to the high\nwindow. \u201cDo you think it will rain tonight?\u201d\nLittle Billy blinked. \u201cQuite\npossibly, yes. Humid day, heavy clouds and a quick drop\nin the temperature.\u201d\nCuthbert chuckled softly.\n\u201cAlways observant.\u201d\nThe silence became ponderous.\n\u201cIs there anything more I could do for you, Cuthbert?\u201d\n\u201c\u2019Do\u2019?\u201d Cuthbert turned to\nface his guest, face and figure almost lost in shadows.\n\u201cNo, nothing more, William, nothing more. You have been\nmost accomodating and I thank you for responding to my summons.\u201d\nHis manner was stiff, far beyond formality.\nLittle Billy put on his coat\nand gloves. He looked at his friend and finally said: \u201cI\nam\u2026 glad I came. Feel free to call on me, or ask me to return.\nAnd Cuthbert\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\nLittle Billy struggled with\nhimself. \u201cNothing.\u201d He turned to leave, and at the hallway\nseparating the room from the distant exit, he turned. \u201cBe\ncareful.\u201d\nCuthbert chuckled, a wet,\nclicking sound. \u201cI will be, I assure you.\u201d\nCHAPTER\n6\nLittle Billy pored over his\nrecent seeding notes when his Mum, all six stone seven of\nher, rapped her way into his laboratory. \u201cBilly? Are ye\ngoing to eat your supper or are ye going to fade away into\nnothing?\u201d\nHer son finished a quick\nnote and rose to give her a hug. It was a bear embracing\na fawn. \u201cMum, I\u2019m finished here and close to starving.\u201d\nMum looked into her son\u2019s\nwide, open face. \u201cYe\u2019re still bothered by that visit, ain\u2019t\nye?\u201d\nA slow nod.\n\u201cWell, whenever ye want to\ntell me about it, ye just let me know.\u201d\nLittle Billy smiled fondly,\ngiving his Mum a silent hug. They were about to leave the\nlaboratory when rain started to fall, heavy drops that thumped\non windows and ground. \u201cHow dreadful!,\u201d exclaimed Mum. \u201cI\nleft my brolly and slicker and now my pots will burn.\u201d\nLittle Billy reached for\nhis huge slicker, hanging on a knob near the door, and covered\nthem both. Suddenly he let out a cry and rushed back to\nhis worktable, flinging rolls of parchment back and forth.\n\u201cMetals and rain! A fortune! Cuthbert\u2019s gone mad!\u201d He flailed\namidst the papers, muttering. \u201cMum! Where\u2019s Pa\u2019s map of\nLondon? The one he drew for the Home Office?\u201d\nMum put her hands on her\nhips. \u201cDon\u2019t ye go finding reasons to skip my supper, Billy.\nYe do that too oft\u2014\u201c\n\u201cMum! Please! The map!\u201d\nBefore she could move a step,\nLittle Billy cried out: \u201cHere it is!\u201d Unrolling it quickly,\nhe searched with a quill pen as his pointer. \u201cCardinal Way\u2026\nCardinal Way\u2026 Near the river, close\u2026 Here! Found it!\u201d He\nlooked at the map. Across the river, across the river\u2026\n\u201cSaints alive!\u201d cried Little Billy. Grabbing his slicker,\nhe rushed out of his laboratory, past an open-mouthed Mum.\n\u201cBilly? Billy!\u201d she cried\nout as her bearish son raced into the rain. \u201cYou forgot\nyour hat!\u201d She saw as Little Billy raced to the stables,\nhis figure growing darker and dimmer with each stride. With\na harumph, Mum marched to the rolled-up map, unfurled it\nand looked closely. She found an ink blot the size of pin\u2019s\nhead on Cardinal Way, and with mutterings, found the other,\nmuch smaller, across the river.\nThe Bank of London.\nCHAPTER\nSEVEN\nCardinal Way was deserted\nas Little Billy\u2019s massive steed clopped in. The fires of\nthe day were doused and the buildings, decrepit in fading\ndaylight were positively horrid in drenched night. Leaping\nfrom his horse, Little Billy landed in a greasy puddle and,\nexcept for his horse, would have tumbled badly. With a muttered\noath, he secured the massive horse to a lamp post and walked\nup the short stoop to 11 Cardinal Way.\nHe felt the thrumming before\nhe could touch the door. Deep, penetrating and raising in\nhim a primitive fear that was almost physically painful.\nBiting down bile, he placed a hand on the doorknob and turned.\nLocked.\nBracing himself, he pulled\nup and inward, forcing the door back toward its hinges.\nThe frazzled frame gave enough to push the door open, a\nwave of thrumming vibrations hitting Little Billy as if\na furnace\u2019s blast.\nThe hallway was like a Leviathan\u2019s\nmaw, deep, foreboding and dangerous. Little Billy swore\nagain, his hand clutching the doorknob fiercely. Without\nanother thought, he tread down the hallway, dodging debris\nas he went, the thrumming waves pushing him back like a\ngiant\u2019s hand.\nAt the entrance to the dreadful\nroom, Little Billy stopped, his innards quivering in nauseating\nfashion. He could hear rain falling nearby and felt the\nheavy wetness in the air. Peering through the darkness,\nhe could see Cuthbert in front of his instrument, almost\ncapering to and fro.\nA distant movement caught\nhis eye and Little Billy looked up to the far corner of\nthe ceiling. A hole \u2013 trapdoor? \u2013 created an opening to\nthe stormy night, from whence the rain came in. As Little\nBilly tried to make sense of the sight, the opening was\nslowly obscured by\u2026 a box.\nA large box, slightly taller\nthan it was wide. It hovered above the hole, then, with\nfits and starts and an almost palpable trembling, it began\ndescending into the room.\nThe flash of a distant lightning\nbolt clarified the picture.\nThe box was a safe.\nCuthbert was stealing a safe. The Bank\nof London!\nWith a muffled cry, Little Billy ran\ntowards Cuthbert. The darting figure sensed the bigger man\u2019s\npresence and after turning his head to see, began moving\nhis hands with dizzying speed, as if a demon.\nLittle Billy\u2019s steps became lighter and\nsuddenly, a mere few feet from Cuthbert, he was once again\nrising above the floor. He thrashed and flailed to no good\neffect, his slow rise continuing. Cuthbert was a dervish,\nhis entire being darting to and fro, hands moving as streaks\nfrom hole to hole.\nThen Little Billy\u2019s rise changed. He\ncontinued to struggle to no avail as his rise became\u2026 diagonal,\nthen slowly horizontal. He could see the pendulum swaying,\nthe bellows pumping air to the dastardly machine. Like a\ndandelion wisp, Little Billy floated through the room and\nwith a horror-filled gasp, he saw to where: beneath the\nsafe.\nThe iron box was almost entirely through\nthe roof and into the room. A small part of Little Billy\u2019s\nbrain marveled at the effort it must have taken for Cuthbert\nto manipulate two such disparate objects, but his will quashed\nthe thought as he rushed to find a solution. Only a few\nfeet separated him from being entirely underneath the safe,\nat which point he knew Cuthbert would cease all activity\nand let the huge weight eliminate the only witness.\nThree feet remained, and nothing Little\nBilly could do slowed his relentless motion. Two feet and\nhe tried a swimming motion, with no positive result. One\nfoot. And then he stopped, directly beneath the safe.\nHe could barely see Cuthbert, but a trick\nof the light gave him a clear view of a madman\u2019s eyes, glittering\nlike sharp ice as they stared in harsh glee at the arrangement\nof box and man. Little Billy opened his mouth to shout\u2014\nFrom out of the darkness, a small figure\nwhacked Cuthbert about the head with what sounded like a\nlength of wood. Instantly, Little Billy began to fall and\nthe moment he landed, he leaped aside, just in time as the\nenormously heavy safe crashed halfway through the floorboards.\n\u201cBilly! BILLY!\u201d cried Mum. \u201cOh, Billy!\u201d\n\u201cMum! I\u2019m here! I\u2019m unhurt!\u201d answered\nthe son as he rushed to her side.\nThe tiny woman hugged most of her boy\nwith a vise-like grip. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do! \u2018ow could\n\u2018e do that? You were up in the air like a ghost!\u201d\nLittle Billy hugged her back and stroked\nher white hair softly. \u201cMum, I think I can explain.\u201d\nSuddenly, a bobby, tall and rain-wet\nin his black slicker, barged in. \u201cMa\u2019am! I asked you to\nwait for me outside!\u201d\n\u201cShe came in to rescue me,\u201d said Little\nBilly. \u201cHow did you get here?\u201d he asked Mum.\n\u201cI used the \u2018ansom,\u201d she replied, deliberately\nmisunderstanding the question. Seeing his look, she relented.\n\u201cYe left two marks on the map and I figured ye\u2019d be \u2018ere.\u201d\nAnother bear hug. \u201cYou figured right,\nMum. Thank you.\u201d\n\u201cMa\u2019am, sir, I have reinforcements coming.\nWhat exactly happened here?\u201d\nLittle Billy separated himself from Mum.\n\u201cOfficer, tend to this man,\u201d he pointed at Cuthbert, immobile\nnear the bench. \u201cAnd would you happen to know two gentlemen\nby the name of Murchison and Leeds?\u201d\n\u201cNo sir, can\u2019t say that I do.\u201d The bobby\nmoved towards Cuthbert.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure your superior officer would\nknow them. Have them brought here and even if\u2014when\u2014it\ntakes all night to explain, you shall know as much as I.\u201d\nThe bobby leaned over Cuthbert, touched his chest and nodded.\nLittle Billy looked around the dark,\nwet room, at the near-fatal safe, set a heavy arm upon Mum\u2019s\nthin shoulders and with a weary sigh, gazed upon the fallen,\nstricken friend of his youth.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050727004221\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/octdec2003\/ethericforces.htm","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/62E1jUbzwMmtJUDlN8UCiMoFNf0.json","volume":4.0,"issues":4.0,"has_text":true}

The chilly October night had already filled with me the silent terror that stalks all October evenings and the thick smell of smoke hung in the air like a cloud pleading to be noticed. I had just come from library where its countless volumes had emptied into me too much thought for a man of my middle years and there is a dangerous trap that comes with deep thought and smoky wind and the very season of autumn, a time unto itself.\nI stood on the moors, gazing out across the vast expanse of quiet land. The branches of the trees edging the moor bent just the right angle for music and that self same wind sifted through them as if the night were offering up a tune to the moor. The sound met my ears with little more than a high pitched whine and I smiled to myself as I thought how silly it was that I could almost make out the faintest melody. Perhaps I recognized the tune, or perhaps it recognized me, but in moments I found myself humming it.\nThe yellow leaves seemed to dance in time and though it may have been but my imagination, I swore the limbs of the blowing trees gave and bowed to the rhythm as well. I imagined them dancing and even saw the shape they took on as a small aspen gentlemen bowing to an elegant spruce. Together they waltzed over my head and the moon filtered through the leaves casting her soft light over the stony ground and played tricks with the colours of the trees. The delicate spruce took on the aspect of a women in a white dress and I smiled to myself again at the absurdity.\nIt was then that I saw her. I stopped as the music's reverie filled me with a sudden fright and my pulse ceased to thrill. At first I saw only a white dress floating across the ground, much like the one I imagined on the tree, but its consistency was that of luminous silk, casting no shadow over the moonlit ground over which it flowed. I think I brought my hand to mouth, though all I remember was the slight tickling of my thick mustache against my flesh, which just as easily could have the wind or the leaves of a plant.\nShe continued to glide and I watched in fixed horror which one might say I got used to after a moment or two and it became a fixation of curiosity. That curiosity however turned to the stopping of my blood as she turned towards me and I saw the face, the glowing features of a childlike woman.\nShe stretched her arms to me as if to ask an embrace, but I do believe I fainted or she vanished. Perhaps both. Next I remembered, I had returned to a well marked path and I hoped for all to have been but my imagination. I might have believed this fallacy and as God is my witness I wish I could have, but my heart still thumped like a drum and the soft tinny music still played in my ears and I stopped, realizing it still played because I was still humming it.\nMy small home, usually the haven for both my heart and my mind, seemed strangely perilous. The lighted windows, soft reflections of the moon, stared at me as I approached. I stood, not wishing to enter, not wishing to remain on the moor and wondering if there might be anywhere else I might spend the night. After several minutes of deliberation I reconciled myself to another night alone without my wife, God rest her soul.\nFor the next two weeks I avoided the moors, walking a good hour out of my way or daring them only by daylight. I would arrive most evenings at half-nine and tried to forget the music that still seemed to come from the darkness of the moors that lay but a quarter mile from my new path.\nI could have told my friends of it, but then, who would have believed such a thing.\nThen came the day it followed me home, the music that is. It was two and a half weeks since I first saw her and the ordeal had been pressed so far to the back of my mind that I had not thought of it in days.\nThat night I allowed my path to stray too near the moors, forgetting in my conscious mind why I took so long a path. The end of October had come and the autumn smoke had become mostly ash. I put my lips together and let fall the fatal humming from deep in my throat. As if summoned from the notes the music rose again from the moors.\nThe whole ordeal came back to me in a sudden rush of both mental and physical anguish. I ran and am not ashamed to say I ran hard. My hat flew off in the wind, becoming the first victim to the awful music. I dashed into my house and shut the door, breathing a sigh of relief into the hard door-frame.\n\"Sweet mother of God,\" I said as I turned around. What little colour remained in my face must have gone from me. The lady stood before me, her arms outstretched, her flowing gown shimmering through the legs of my kitchen-table. She turned and floated to my bedroom where she vanished through the dark door. Every impulse and all the good sense my blessed mother had bestowed upon me screamed for retreat into the night. Fore even that devil's music could not be worse than that woman in my home. Despise my wishes and pleas to my body for quick departure, my legs refused to move. The air inside my home had taken on the autumn smell of smoke though my fireplace lay dormant.\nI felt myself thrust forward, a sensation that seemed far more like a pull than a push. The most terrifying place I could imagine going, the blackness of my bedroom, had now become my unwitting destination and I know I must have cried as I moved forward. My room itself had taken on a darkness deeper than one could find in any space that merely lacked light. As I stumbled through that damnable threshold I saw the form on my bed. It lay turned against the wall, a form not spectral, but quite firm and real. The flowing white dress was now one of yellowed lace and of the head, all I could see was a mass of grey hair. I reached my hand, which remained strangely steady, towards the mass of hair. My finger caught the far edge of the forehead and pulled, feeling the head give and turn towards me, the cold glass eyes starred into mine without a blink. The face resembled that of the woman, but aged by forty years or more.\nThe skin felt hard and I realized I held at my fingertips the head of a mannequin. The pale white paint was cracked and peeling, giving the head the shattered look of an ancient face long dead. I drew my arm past its hand. It seemed to grip me by the wrist. I found it was the shape of the tapered fingers that gripped, but as I drew my hand past a second time it happened again.\nThen it was that the Tinny music began again, resonating from inside the room. It began soft, but grew to a volume that thundered inside me like a torrent of thumping waves. I had no more control of my body at all and at that moment it ceased to matter. I reached around the wooden body and pulled it from the bed. The mannequin proved to be no more than half a mannequin, but I held it in my arms, its hand, her hand in mine. As the Tinny music played I danced. The lace dress swept the ground. I spun, waltzing about the room. The music played on. I waltzed, eyes closed, the smoky air filling my lungs.\nAs soft as it had started the music ebbed, trailing off into the darkness. I fell to my knees, holding nothing now save the dress. As I clutched it to me I knew it had once been by my wife's dress, her wedding dress lost so many years ago. I wept as I knelt there, holding it to me like a lover, spilling my salty tears into the soft cotton of the lace.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050421124105\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/aprjun2001\/dress.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The Internet's Premier Magazine of Historical Science Fiction","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/gIyCZgtjhPKHUYuex5Vz246O+ng.json","volume":2.0,"issues":2.0,"has_text":true}

Raney and her brother\nsquatted on separate burlap-cushioned stools pulled up a pace or two from their\ngrandmother\u00eds black leather shoes oddly tied with purple laces.\nThe dark mystery lurking behind her luminous rust brown eyes warned them\nto shush fussing and sit tight, their ears perked.\n\u010fWell, you must first try and understand how after the field surgeons\ncauterized his stump, your grandfather became a driven man, terror stricken by\nShiloh\u00eds blood.\u0112 Amid the\nday\u00eds dimming half-light, she licked at lips pale as clabber.\nTenderly, she clucked back to soothe the scratching and pecking\nDomineckers engulfed by the ancestral chinaberry tree\u00eds shade.\n\u010fNot all the religion in this world can ease an old soldier\u00eds\nsoul,\u0112 she continued, a hand knotted by sallow calluses perching on Raney\u00eds\nfrail, half-grown shoulder. \u010fWhat\u00eds\nmore, don\u00edt let the government tell you otherwise.\nIn war, do your best to keep your little brother at home.\u0112\nPretty near to copping a conniption, Raney had to pipe up.\n\u010fBut, Grams, they say he had an agate eye and a hickory peg leg; they\nsay he used to stalk along the knolls muttering obscenities to himself; they say\nit was plenty enough to craze even a lesser man.\u0112\n\u010fIf they say you\u00edre a unicorn sent from Mars, would you\naccept it for gospel truth?\u0112 demanded the old lady.\nWithout waiting for any answer, she asserted, \u010fWell, of course you\nwouldn\u00edt.\u0112\n\u010fSorry, ma'am.\u0112 Almost\nreduced to tears, Raney raked back an errant strand of hair, undid the\ntortoiseshell comb, and collected it back together.\n\u010fIt\u00eds all right, honey.

H. Hodgson\u2019s world of The Night Land. Image credits: \"Upon His Return\" (c) Duncan Long.\nI should inform the reader first of the circumstances that led to my tardy return to Earth, before setting down this tale, by way of apology, though I am not certain to whom, for it is with certitude, I fear, that at this point I have determined myself to be the last man alive.\nI recall that a number of years ago, as a young man, I was placed by my fellow creatures into a device that resembles the sarcophagi of millennia of Earth tradition, but capable of supporting and sustaining life for a long journey; I am hopeful that you, dear reader, will find among your records the knowledge of a science similar to that which I describe in the attached notes.\nWe, that is perhaps a number of us equal to the population of a small settlement or a very large extended family, took leave of our home planet, having sufficient means to do so and to construct a vehicle for our departure, at a time when its population exceeded forty million million individuals. Our civilization had attained a level of advancement sufficient to determine the location and distance of several habitable worlds, and it was our dear and fervent hope that, traveling at great speed toward the nearest of them, we might move in succession from one to the next until such time as we found a new home, or were forced to return. It was to be a long journey, and it was anticipated that many children would be born en route; in fact, it was hoped that the journey itself would not render our women infertile from exposure to the harshness of interstellar travel; even so, we were limited in what resources we could take with us and thus forced to use the sarcophagi, whose science, in may be summed briefly, extended our physical existence, so that a few of us, it was hoped, might live to see our new home.\nOnly Fate, or Chance, or God, or Pneuma, or whatever name the reader gives to the metaphysical ordering of the universe, may explain by what causative chain I arrived at this time and place; the little I know is that seventeen generations had been born and died when I was placed, at the appointed age, into one of the Life-Pods, as we called them, and that the Masters of the Voyage had failed to find a suitable place to set down. I am forced to conclude that after three hundred years, our supplies were running low and we were of necessity returning.\nPerhaps, in a roundabout way, this explains the reduction of our numbers. I have often speculated as to the general absence of People when I Awakened, and I have been tempted to credit my survival to fortunate location during a period of what appears to have been general starvation. Early on, as I roamed the ship, I observed the smell of decay, and noted that The Life-Pods of many of the Others of my generation bore signs of forced intrusion. Perhaps some of the Awake had resorted to cannibalism.\nI should tell the reader that it was thus my exceeding good fortune to Awaken at a time when the ship was again approaching Earth, for food was scarce. Moreover, I bless my Ancestors for their forethought in designing a craft capable of landing itself and resuscitating its sole occupant.\nBefore landing, I attempted to surmise the interval that had passed since the ship\u2019s departure. I repeated a simple formula involving the speed of the ship and the number of years that had transpired, the sole object of my scientific teaching as a child, by which those who landed or returned might determine the time that had passed on Earth. The Ship, I was told, drew on an energy of the ambient void that allowed it to span the vast, abyssal stretch to the nearest stars within a few generations\u2019 time. We were supposed to have reached the first of them in a single generation. Though I have found written records difficult to obtain, and I do not know how to operate the ship\u2019s libraries, all indications, and my verbal teaching, confirm that our first objective was achieved. Thereupon, the matter fell to the speed of the ship.\nUsing the formula, by my calculation, I determined that we had reached our first destination in seven multiples of the time required of a beam of light, meaning our ship was traveling at ninety-two percent of that velocity. That meant that after seventeen generations, two or three thousand years should have transpired. I did not expect to find myself able to communicate with the planet\u2019s current residents, but I hoped against hope that someone would recognize my craft from old records. The ship, I had been taught, was trained to recognize and respond to an attempt at communication, and I could not rule out the possibility that it already had. However, it seemed strangely silent.\nAfter some time, it occurred to me that in my calculations, I had not allowed for time in the Life-Pod, failing to take note that a human generation might easily span three or even four hundred years. I multiplied my answers by a factor of twenty, arriving at a date sixty thousand years from my departure.\nI cannot explain to the reader the severity of desolation that overcame me at this point, for even though the ship had not yet made land, I was certain that human technological civilization had not survived in any recognizable form.\nI resolved upon landing to search for remnants, such as they might be.\nAs the ship made its descent, I felt my body float, then return to weightfulness, and hurried to secure a place near a Great Side Window, behind the Bussard Intake, in whose shadow lay the bulk of the ship, in order to observe the approach. Shortly thereafter, the Intake separated in a graceful dance and was gone from view.\nThe descent took some time, perhaps three days, and I was grateful for the opportunity to survey the land to which I would soon be returning. During this time, it appeared that the ship was searching for a beacon or landing spot, and not finding one, finally abandoned the search and settled on a general descent into the darkness on the anti-sunward side of the planet.\nHaving nothing else to do, I took\ncopious notes, which I leave now in the hope that some day, someone will happen\nupon them and know that our race, or what became of it, did not perish in feral\nignominy. Hereupon begins my story.\n#\nThe Earth I returned to had changed greatly, and in retrospect I did not realize realize how much. As I review my notes, I see that during the three-day-descent, whose passage I note only by my sleep patterns, the same face of the planet presented itself constantly to the sun. This I judged by identifying several landmarks, you will understand, and observing the lack of change in their position over time.\nOnce or twice, I thought I observed a blinking or twinkling just beyond the thin line separating darkness from the light, which I now realize was inordinately dim; I now suspect vulcanism as the source.\nThe second thing I noticed was the abundance of continent-spanning glaciers. In fact, it would be false to say this was the second thing I noticed, for as I attempted to identify the continents, I noticed both that the water level had dropped severely, presumably because much of the water was now taken up into the great bodies of ice, but also that the few recognizable features such as mountain ranges did not lie where they belonged. I tried to account for their new locations by considering axial tilt, which presumably had changed at least three times since my departure, but that would have explained only a change in orientation.\nThese continents, I noticed, had changed position.\nAcross the surface of the daylight side now spanned great masses of gray clouds whose position seemed relatively constant; I surmised that they had been built up over time by the rise of cool air masses circulating from the night side, though I could not account for their sheer bulk given the relative rarity of surface water. I remembered something about thunderstorms, which I had never seen before, and guessed that these great gray giants must be some entirely self-contained variety that circulated their moisture in huge vertical cyclones.\nOne the one day that a portion of the storms cleared, it was evident that no human settlement lay beneath.\nWhen the ship landed, I took some time provisioning myself before setting out, not knowing what to expect. For reasons unknown, the ship had selected a location on the dark side, perhaps two thousand miles behind the terminator, so I packed for a cold, harsh world of eternal night, taking the most whole and fitting of the bodysuits that hung on a rack near the exit, stocking my pockets with as many long-lasting light sources as I could find. After additional thought, and desperately hungry, I searched for and eventually found several devices I might use variously as weapons or tools. One of my first jobs, unfortunately, was to find, slay and eat a decent meal; after this, I reasoned, I could set my eye to exploring and looking for others.\nThe ship had landed in the middle of a vast sloping plain whose extent was barely discernable in the lambent orange sootiness of the distant moon, a light so weak that it was entirely washed out by the glow from the occasional volcano. I ventured to determine direction but found it impossible given the general lack of landmarks and the complete absence of a stable magnetism.\nI let my eyes adjust, and looked around. Downward, the slope continued as far as I could see, eventually ending in a range of low mountains and volcanoes, the tallest of which was bathed in a dim glow near the bottom. This I decided indicated nothing about the presence of life or civilization. Behind me, up the slope at a great distance, was a line of black hills, over whose top peered a bright, silvery structure that ascended into the night. It looked different from the mountains around, perhaps the result of terraforming. I decided to find out what it was.\nI had no choice but to make my way on foot, so I set out directly after assuring myself of the security of the ship, and of my ability to return and re-enter it. At the outset, I took great care to trace my path, to attempt to fix my location against some landmark, but after a short while I grew fearful that repeated attempts at summoning light to the task might not only drain the limited power of my lights, but also attract unwelcome attention to my progress.\nThe land ahead was a harsh, wind-blown vista unlike any other I have seen; indeed, it was difficult to recognize any of it as my native Earth. I had seen pictures of my home planet as a child, and the landscapes were various and sundry, ranging from verdant fields of vegetation, bedecked with broad swaths of color that swayed and undulated beneath gentle breezes; to jagged spires of olivine basalt thrown up through the bedrock of olden seas into the icy dominion of snow-covered mountains. In every one of a thousand images, though, I had seen a splendid beauty and light that bespoke the natural rhythm of a place alive. The scene that I now laid eyes on was dark, sour, and gray, and over it everywhere hung the look not just of death or destruction, but of obliteration. As I cast my eyes ahead to the range of black hills, illumined by a sourceless pallor, I could make out not a single green thing, nor any evidence that there had ever been such a color. It was as if even the memory of life had been forgotten.\nThe incline was so gradual that I did not at first notice my progress; however, after what seemed like several hours, I ventured to shine my light on the way I had passed. My ship, dark except for a small beacon-light atop its vast bulk, lay against a background so black and featureless as to render it invisible; I could tell its location only by the manner in which it obstructed the faint, nacreous glow of some distant fire-pit. Even so, by the practice of heaving small rocks and counting the bounces, I reasoned that in places it rose higher than others. I had lately been ascending such a rise and now felt it in my legs.\nNo particular spot on the featureless slope afforded comfort, so after an indeterminate interval I chose a boulder of moderate size and flatness and sat down to rest.\nIts surface was oddly smooth, in places covered with flakes of a dry, pockmarked substance that might equally have been paint or lichen. I picked at a patch of it until I had removed a piece large enough to hold up between my fingers and examine further. The rear or underside portion had a smooth, featureless texture that when wet might be called gummy, had it not become so brittle over the eons. With one hand I laid the piece flat on my palm, tilting it slightly to shelter it from the brisk, icy wind in whose grasp small clouds of dust were periodically swept up into eddies. The pattern of chips on the massive rock reminded me of sea-coral, but it lacked the frail grace of the animal\u2019s perforated skeleton. The patchy encrustation on the rock had a dark brown, rusty, mineral look, and if I looked hard I could imagine that I saw a faint sheen of exudite trailing from a few of them. I desperately wished for a paleontologist, a biologist, for anyone; but as the reader will surmise, none were to be found. I carefully pocketed a few small flakes and arose to continue my journey.\nIt is difficult to say what I was looking for, for my perceived mission had changed several times since my Awakening. Upon the return to Earth, I had intended to establish communications with whatever civilization I might find, and failing that, I had decided to look for remnants of such in the ruins and monuments, or at worst in the wild outposts of its receding edge. Surely the most stalwart of races had survived in recognizable form, for it had been only forty-two thousand years from the discovery of the first counting-notches among Neolithic cultures to the mounting of manned space expeditions. A quick sum had told me that twice that had expired, but I had hoped for a blossoming of the flower of Man, not its demise.\nNow, it seemed, I was at a loss.\nI held little hope that the blasted landscape around me had proven hospitable to the waning dew of enlightenment that had so briefly sparkled on the planet\u2019s surface. Indeed, I wagered myself lucky to find any remnant at all; yet, for no other reason save that it seemed to be my nature, I searched. I did not have to search for long, but I was not prepared for what I found. It was to my best recollection six days later that I ascended a low rise and saw the Pyramid.\nThe top of the Herculean structure, of which a part was visible, had been what I saw across the summit of the Black Hills before I crossed. I had at first deduced the thing to be a snow-covered mountain, and perhaps it was. The Thing I saw could be none other than a building, however, for its edges were pure and razor-sharp. By what means it ascended the miles into heaven is any man\u2019s guess. I will perhaps never know, for my attention was drawn to the scene surrounding it. Surrounding the Great Pyramid at an unknown distance was a great low circular wall, on which I thought I could make out regularly spaced markings that might be doors or passages, for from them emanated hundreds of faint trails or roads. If these were to scale, the wall was anywhere from forty to one hundred times my height, though estimating was made even more difficult by the fact that the ragged top leaned in toward the Great Pyramid itself. My heart sank as I noticed a torn-away section of the wall and realized that the larger building\u2019s defenses had been breached. From this area also ran an abundance of trails or roads, which led toward what I must assume was the main entry. Around that place, at the end of the many roads, were collected a number of darker hillocks that appeared to be separate from the underlying stone. A lone light shone down from somewhere high at the top of the Pyramid, illuminating the scene.\nMy surroundings were deathly still and quiet, and I chanced lighting one of the electro-chemical devices I had been saving for the purpose of navigation, in order to hurry down the craggy incline toward the lowland in which the Pyramid sat. Its yellow glare blazed in stark contrast to the bleak vista, and as I moved it bounced in and out of deep crevices to one side, down which massive rockslides seemed to have reached millennia-long equilibria. My progress was eerily silent, but I could not help feeling that I was making noise with the light alone. When I reached the bottom of a long, steep descent, I rested and turned off the light again.\nMy legs, especially my toes, ached from the hurried climb, and at one point I found it necessary to expose myself to the environment. The air was crisp, thin and numbing, and I made quick work of soothing my injuries and attending to my toilet. It felt odd, after so many years in the sarcophagus, to answer the needs of a working body, but I was grateful for everything that made me feel alive and human. I quickly donned the removed parts of my outfit, except for those unmentionables of which I needed to dispose, and was glad to feel heat and pressure returning. As I assayed my surroundings, I determined that there was no present risk, but for the first time since my arrival, I felt the need to defend myself. I checked about my waist to assure myself of the status of my weapons, then pressed forward toward the Pyramid.\nIt took me nearly another week to walk the distance separating me from the vast circular Wall that surrounded the pyramid, beyond which a considerable expanse remained. I made for the nearest wall, deciding that it would afford me at least minimal cover, then followed its contour toward the Breach.\nIt is worth noting here the appearance of the Wall. From my vantage at its base, it seemed nothing but a massive building, extending infinitely ahead and behind, and disappearing into nothingness above. Along its lower edge, from the ground to perhaps four or five times my height, the wall was utterly featureless and black, except for a thin covering of dust, and a lone rod, or sort of banister, that ran its length as far as the eye could see. The rod was held out from the wall, on thick, metallic or stone struts, and the body of the rod appeared to be of some sort of silver metal, perhaps as thick as my body. There was a peculiar absence of dust within one or two body-lengths of the rod above and below it. On a lark, I got out a simple mechanical compass, an ancient device that required no power, but which was capable of detecting electromagnetism. I was not surprised at what I discovered: when I held the compass flat, it pointed along the circumference of the rod, in a nearly straight line parallel to the wall. When I held the compass on its side, the device pointed straight up.\nSo this Wall was truly a defense, perhaps Humanity\u2019s last. Through this massive, thirty-mile ring had coursed a magnificent Magnetic Current, one strong enough to permanently magnetize the rod. And it had been broken, sundered in an area perhaps one twentieth its length, through which predators had doubtlessly passed.\nI shouldered the most powerful of the weapons, a medium-range Graser whose original design had been for rock mining. It was heavy, but I did not care to take chances under the circumstances.\nThe walk to the Breach from where I had met the Wall took me right at a day. At that point my hunger had mutated to a ravening will to hunt. It had come to my attention that such a transformation must overcome every man to whom Starvation presents its ugly face. I wondered off-handedly how it had been for the residents of the Pyramid.\nFor it had to be a residence. There would be no sense in constructing such an elaborate defense for a burial ground, or a dump, or a weapons store. Something in the back of my mind told me that in this Pyramid was all that survived of Mankind.\nAs my step quickened toward the near edge of the Breach, another thought occurred to me. What if there had been others? It wasn\u2019t too much to imagine that over the course of sixty thousand years another civilization had arisen from an offshoot clan of outsiders, perhaps religious zealots or survivalists who found life in the Pyramid too restricting. What if not one, but several? What would have become of them by now? Would they still be eking out a living in the highlands somewhere, or perhaps huddling in a cave mouth along the banks of a dark river?\nThe dark mounds gathered near the opening of the Pyramid now took on a more sinister look, that of an intentionally formed group. I shuddered. Certainly in this vast and desolate place any number of congregations of stone formations might take on such an appearance, given adequate time. And yet, I could not escape the mental comparison to the concept that the Door, if indeed that is what it was, had been surrounded.\nAs I rounded the breach, I saw what I shall describe as The Clock. It was not so much a clock as a building upon which sat a collection of stones and weights and primitive gears, but it was unmistakably the creation of intelligence. My heart leapt at the discovery of something that finally connected me with Earth, with Life, with Intelligence\u2026 even if it no longer remained.\nThe structure was tall, though not by comparison with the Pyramid or Wall, and perhaps as wide as the thickest portion of the Wall. It might have been easily overlooked had I not ventured in where I did. Upon further reflection, it seemed that I was looking at a great stone building, formed of a rough-hewn rock rather than the white, shiny substance of the Pyramid, and unlike the Ring it did not appear to have ever housed technology. I walked around it twice, surveying the place, which resembled a giant wedge laid on its side. From the lower end, the roof of the building was visible, and it was apparent that beyond the massive stone-and-metal assemblage the center of the structure lay open to the air. At the other end of the building was a doorway, through which, after a time, I entered. Inside were the remains of a courtyard and pool of sorts, through which at one point, light must have streamed. From my stores, I produced one of the Electrochemical Lights and turned it on.\nAs far as I could tell, the gallery surrounding the courtyard had been intended as some sort of museum. Careful to observe my point of entry, I pressed onward, into the interior, tracing a generally clockwise path past numerous alcoves set back into the stone behind polished cylindrical columns. As I walked, I shone the light on each of the alcoves in succession. Most were empty.\nIn one alcove I found what surely must have been a flying-ship, for it was large, oblong, and covered in gray metal, and bore the general design of my own much larger ship. However, the markings were of a language I did not recognize. I pressed further, stumbling eventually upon the dust-covered remnants of a transparent case, now nothing but brittle shards lying in a circle about the display. Beyond this, around a turn to my left was a long hallway that led toward the outer wall. In this hallway I found numerous small artifacts, each marked with symbols in the same strange language.\nIn the center of the hallway was flat table with an assortment of shallow depressions grouped into small collections. At one side of the display sat a pile of smooth, roughly circular stones. I picked up one of the stones and placed it into a depression.\nAs I expected, nothing happened. Then I noticed that around some of the hollows were traced grooves that separated each group from the other. Carved into the flat stone of the table near the same side of each group were symbols. Each group of similar number bore the same symbol, though the arrangement of the depressions was entirely different. I noticed after a while that there were additional, smaller symbols next to the uncircumscribed groups within the larger groups. Again, the smaller symbols always referred to the same number of depressions. Impulsively, I counted them out in my head and marked them in the slanting light by placing some of the small stones in each depression.\nWhen I stepped back I realized that the table was a lesson in arithmetic! Two stones and another two stones, each pair marked with the same symbol, were circumscribed and marked with another symbol that obviously meant \u2018four\u2019. Other groupings had special symbols for \u2018ten\u2019, and in several places, instead of hollows, there were groupings of engraved symbols for \u2018ten\u2019, \u2018twenty\u2019, and so forth, on up to numbers quite large indeed. I got out my notes and transcribed each symbol and the number it meant, then went back to the last few displays I had passed. Now the markings made a sort of sense. As far as I could tell, each display was marked with a string of symbols that uniquely identified it. I ventured a guess that the race that erected the museum had knowledge of place-value, and wrote down a few of the inscriptions I had seen below a sampling of alcoves. After some time, though, I could make no further sense and moved on.\nAbout ninety percent of the display alcoves were empty, or their contents had disintegrated, but the Museum was quite large, and, as I have said, I took copious notes as I went. What was left of the ancient reliquary was indeed revealing, for it seemed to house items of both great age and recency. I recognized one or two from my own time!\nIt was perhaps another two or three hours before I noticed a second pattern. It seemed that the shortest strings of what I now assumed were numbers were associated with artifacts that seemed to be of middling age. I recognized fossil remains of Permian reptiles, including one perfectly-preserved Dimetrodon, the aforementioned flying ship, an assortment of stone axes and tools apparently from the Neolithic Age, and two pieces of equipment, one we call a signitor, whose mates I might easily find on my own vehicle. It was on these last three that the numbers were shorter. On the Dimetrodon was the number three hundred ten followed by a symbol that looked like the eye of a great storm, but cut in half horizontally; on the axes the number fourteen followed by the same symbol, and on the signitor the number two. The Flying ship bore a larger number, and a different symbology that I thought might indicate a comparison.\nI cannot say in retrospect, but it was this, I think, that drove me to return to the outside of the building and climb up on its low end, whose landward edge was no more than half my height. It seemed, in fact, that the building\u2019s design were not mere art or architecture, but a functional design. As I lifted my bulk atop the low roof and scaled it, the design was even more apparent. A series of flat, broad steps carved into the surface ascended toward a large square open area that I now knew was the courtyard around which I had recently passed.\nAbout a third of the way toward the courtyard, the thick end of a wide black stone wedge rose from the roof on which I walked, becoming narrower toward the high side of the building. On this thick side were engraved more numbers, and some symbols. I brushed at them with my hand to remove a thick layer of dirt and encrustation. Beneath the covering were more symbols, in what appeared to be a range of twenty or thirty languages. I thought I recognized one of them, though the written symbols were greatly mutated, primitive, and ideographic. Beside some of the words were symbols that I took to be images of the sun, moon, a bipedal figure, certain constellations and other rebuses with no identifiable context. With effort, I pieced together what I could.\n(THIS DEVICE) MAN BUILDING TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED\n\u2018TWO CIRCLES\u2019 MAN THIS-BUILDING WEAPON TWENTY-EIGHT\nSWIRL\nThere were few interpretations that made any sense, and after several unfruitful attempts at translation, I moved on up the incline toward the mass or stone, metal and what appeared to be machinery, resolving to return to the inscriptions when it was possible to make more of them.\nPresently I came upon a vantage point from which I could observe an open space in the interior of the mechanical assembly. At the far end, through a cage-like metal structure that speared and connected several boulder-like objects as large as a man, was what appeared to be a door. In the dim light coming from high up on the Pyramid it was possible to make out the machine\u2019s features, and owing to the narrowness of the space among the stones, I stored my Light and squeezed through to an open space at the very center, then onward through the door at the far side. On the far side was a little room, on whose near wall was displayed a miniature image of the machine. On each of five circles that I took to represent the man-sized stones outside was a symbol. Two of the symbols were worn to the point of unreadability, but I could make out those for moon and sun, and another that simply displayed a small circle moving around a larger circle. Curious, I went outside to compare what I had seen with the actual structure. Indeed, on the inner face of each stone was a symbol that matched the image in the small room. This time, I could see, a fourth image displayed what looked like a two-tailed fish or a storm, a circle with several curving lines emanating out in a spiral, but divided in half by a straight line.\nI was in the center of the circle when the stone bearing the image of\nthe Sun moved!\nIt is more accurate to say that the stone, which merely sat at the end of the longest of several metal arms, changed its position a hand\u2019s breadth, but the mere movement stunned me. For an instant, I feared the structure would collapse on me, I being between it and the hollow chamber beneath. However, after what I can only describe to you as a Great Short While, for I had no means of measurement, nothing further happened. When the opportunity presented itself, I escaped the Circle of Moving Stones and exited again to the sloping roof. It was then that I noticed the additional inscriptions around the rim of the Great Black Wedge, near the top. The entire perimeter of the wedge was inscribed with vertical marks, at regular intervals, or nearly so, except for a brief interruption on one side that seemed to be a table for unit conversion. For instance, it appeared that fifty-two suns comprised a moon, seven moons a two-circle, one million two-circles a half-storm, and two-hundred fifty half-storms a storm. As to the remainder, above each mark was a number, and above some of the marks were the man-sized stones, one of which had just moved. In my estimation, the stones were intended to move in a circle, pointing at different times to different positions on the Wedge.\nI took out my notes on the Museum collection and turned on the light. I read slowly: Dimetrodon, 310 Half-Storm (which I had noted somewhere was also recorded as storm, sixty half-storm); Stone Axe, fourteen half-storm; Signitor, two half-storm; Flying Ship, four hundred thousand two-circles. In my light-headed state, I ran excited at my discovery through other wings of the Museum, checking my theory against each display. The numbers were dates!\nIt took me considerable time to arrive at a straight system reckoning, but I had the artifacts as a baseline, including one from my own time, and after a short while I learned that one of the additional symbols I had skipped probably indicated \u2018positive\u2019, and another, or its absence, \u2018negative\u2019. I mounted the roof again, a spring in my step, energized by the knowledge that I might now have the means to record my observations against a meaningful context. As I have said before, I had determined the strange device atop the Museum to be a clock, and indeed it was. What remained was to make another assay, to observe the positions of the stones.\nThis, I quickly determined, after reasoning unverifiably that the direction of motion was most likely \u2018positive\u2019, was FORTY-ONE HALF-STORM, TWO HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND, SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTEEN TWO-CIRCLE, FOUR MOON, FIVE SUN. A number, if my conversions were correct, equal to 41,210,715, followed by \u2018four moon, five sun\u2019. And so, most gracious reader, it is by this route that I lead you, whomever you may be, to judge for yourselves the conclusions I have drawn, before I set out on this my final journey, man-kind\u2019s final journey, on Earth.\nThe realization struck the most base and vile of fears in my mortal soul. For it is well known that the species Dimetrodon walked the earth in the late Paleozoic, during a period once referred to as the Permian, almost exactly two hundred and ninety million years ago. That said, it is without a doubt that I may now conclude that I have arrived long past the year sixty thousand, long past the Age of the Great Arcologies so thoroughly noted in the precious leaflets discovered nearly a week ago, if there is any longer such a thing, in the bowels of the Great Museum. I have arrived long past even the age of Predation, ecological cataclysm, and the final destruction of Civilization, which the loner and fellow traveler \u2018X\u2019, whose notes have proved so useful, foretold in his waning years.

The creature called Mperaganer relaxed slightly and eyed me with a suspicious glare.\n\u201cTo determine whether you were real.\u201d\n\u201cVery well, then,\u201d said I. \u201cPray come in.\u201d\nThe extreme circumstances under which I admitted the stranger who appeared at my doorstep on the night of September 11, 1884, cannot be overstated. Had I not recently completed my repast, I should certainly not have been in a position to hear the muffled knocking that issued from behind the stout oaken door, for the kitchen was but a short distance from the vestibule. Had I not been attending keenly upon the next thunderclap, I would doubtless have ignored the sound as the play of wind and rain upon the structure\u2019s decaying exterior.\nThe residence in which I lived sat at the end of a long down-sloping path lined with ogrish oaks and maples whose frail, verdant palms, raised in vigorous supplication for the rain, squirmed uncomfortably amid the newer Japanese vines. They had been planted only a decade ago by my uncle, whose brother \u2013 for I could not refer to as my father the itinerant speculator who had obtained the land in settlement of a wager -- had given it unto me for the summer to restore as I saw fit. I had been on its far side, attending to my toilet, when I detected the faint noise.\nFive quick raps, sharp and light, followed by three heavier sounds that might have been a hand striking the wood with an open fist, spelling out a percussive sequence that repeated itself after a few seconds.\nTap tap tap tap tap. Thump... thump... thump...\nThe hour was well past nine o\u2019clock, and concerned that a neighbor might suddenly be in need, or that a young lady might have fallen into ill fortune along the road, I hurried to answer the door. When I arrived, standing there in the downpour was a miserable creature that could only be described as a hideous, pallid pantomine of the Emperor Napoleon. The diminutive figure stood all of nine hands, the bulk of which was subtended by its ample belly, in the form of a man, but no man I had ever seen. It had the mouth of a terrier, all yellow, misshapen incisors and black lips, and its skin bore the pale hue to which moonlight gives its unique ethereal quality. As I stood there considering how to address such a personage, it reached beneath the folds of its jacket and withdrew a rod of silver perhaps four inches long, which it pointed at me in a way any fool would recognize.\nThen without remorse, it shot me.\nAs one might expect of such an encounter, I fell to the floor clutching my chest. I thought surely I must have perished, for a moment later I arose, floating above the scene.\nTap tap tap tap tap. Thump... thump... thump...\nI answer the door again, and it is Mperaganer. I gesture in welcome, and he shoots me.\nTap tap tap tap tap. Thump... thump... thump...\nI clutch at my chest, feeling the thumping in my very soul, but I stand there staring at him as the rain pours down in sheets, encloistering this lurid fantasy in a dim bubble of reality. I beg him to stop.\nMperaganer ushers himself into the parlor, takes his place on the divan, whose cushion bears the delicate silk work of Persian design, and scans the room, sniffing it like a mongrel. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d he seethes, adding \u201cThe Desvar\u201d in a low growl a moment later when it is obvious I do not understand. It is as though the sound of the word, a title of some sort, brings an odor to his comically-flared nostrils that is not altogether pleasant. He turns his head and sniffs at the room again, first left, then right and behind, describing a nearly complete circle.\n\u201cHe is gone.\u201d\nTry as I may, I cannot eliminate its sound from my head. It is like the nagging of a nightjar at three o\u2019clock in the morning.\nTap tap tap tap tap. Thump... thump... thump...\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\u201cMy name is Aaron Goldin.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I know. A relative. But who are you now?\u201d\n\u201cA nephew, or a cousin,\u201d I say, \u201cdepending on whom you seek. I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t recognize you, however, and have no idea of the reason for your appearance. Apart from the fact that I grow increasingly annoyed with your sudden and repeated appearance.\u201d\nHe flashes a toothy grin, a canine assessment of prey, I note. He helps himself to a pinch of snuff from a small box sitting on the table between us.\n\u201cSo you know nothing of the Desvar?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cI should think that were obvious.\u201d\n\u201cAre you the property\u2019s owner?\u201d\n\u201cNominally.\u201d\n\u201cWhat year is this?\u201d Mperaganer suddenly asks.\nI reply in measured tones. \u201cIt is eighteen-eighty four, and you\u2019ve still to explain yourself.\u201d\nThe tapping noise returns, and for a moment I am observing the dialogue from without, as before. A buzzing sensation, a brief period of disorientation, and a wave of nausea attack me at once like wolves. I grasp for something to focus on, and my eye catches a large cedar standing-clock in the hallway. I recall that it was manufactured in Germany during the reign of Frederick Barbarossa and passed down to me through an uncle. It is what connects us, I think. What makes us one.\nThe clock has no hands, then when I look at it again it has hands but they are spinning wildly. As the oddly fluid motion settles down, the monster called Mperaganer makes a noise that, were I half the betting man Jacob was, I would swear was an oath.\nMperaganer gets up and paces the floor. \u201cWhen did you last see him?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t recall. Perhaps... let me see, it was... January a year ago that he --\u201d I stopped myself. \u201cGood Lord, man, I don\u2019t even know you. I daresay you\u2019ve cheek to ask the whereabouts of my relatives.\u201d\nMy unwelcome guest leans forward, as though he might with that terrier face attack my knees, and whispers in a low voice. \u201cAh, but you do.\u201d\nBack to the present now, the scenes overlapping. My guest frowns, then leans back on the furniture. He smiles. I have you, he seems to say.\nTap tap tap tap tap. Thump... thump... thump...\nHours pass. It is raining again. He is at the door. Drawn to destiny, I answer. The door opens, Mperaganer enters and shoots me. I clutch my chest.\n\u201cIn the name of God, why did you do that?\u201d\nTo call the sensation d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu would be putting it mildly. I have been here, physically, thousands of times before. This time, I simply stare. Minutes pass, and Mperaganer is utterly soaked, yet he does not enter.\n\u201cYou still haven\u2019t given me an answer,\u201d he growls, reaching inside the French army-general\u2019s jacket that makes him look like a circus clown.\nI smile. \u201cYou haven\u2019t asked the right question.\u201d\nMperaganer casts me an angry glance. I gaze over my shoulder into the parlor, where the yellow brocade of the divan leers at me like my guest\u2019s teeth, piercing and malevolent. It seems that I cannot look away from that ugly face.\nHis gaze follows mine to the sofa. \u201cSilk\u2026Damask\u2026 Damascus, is it? That\u2019s where you hid the Pragemon? Among a community of gnostic recluses? Ha ha! Bravo! You know, Matthew, I will find it eventually. You are becoming weak.\u201d\n\u201cMy name is Aaron Goldin,\u201d I say, my voice quivering. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea to what you refer.\u201d\n\u201cWe both know better than that, Matthew, just as we know this is not 1884. You cannot hide from me behind the thoughts of your ancestors. Come out into the light. Let us see each other face-to-face....\u201d\nI have rehearsed the words over a thousand times, once for each day Mperaganer has troubled my doorstep. \u201cThe Pragemon is not important to me,\u201d I say.\n\u201cYou lie. A man does not hide that which he does not value.\u201d\n\u201cHave it your way, then.\u201d The nape of my neck prickles. I can feel a small bead of perspiration forming on my left eyebrow, but I feel helpless, unable to do something as simple as reaching up and wiping it off. A part of me is paralyzed by the realization that I am facing an Ancient at last. \u201cMperaganer, why have you come? Sevard thought you were dead.\u201d\n\u201cI want the Pragemon. I am tired of waiting.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a stupid cane, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d\nMperaganer gets up and walks toward the front of the old house, the same house in which every Goldin since Jacob and Joseph has lived, turns and faces me. The all-too-familiar yellow, toothy grin has spread across his face. \u201cNo matter. It might as well be to you.\u201d\nI return his stare with a look of befuddlement. You are doing fine, Aaron, just fine. Keep it up just a few moments longer....\n\u201cA location in the Holy Land. An excellent hiding place. That would make sense. To guard the Pragemon among religious artifacts, shroud it in mystery somewhere far from civilization. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of it earlier. A primitive society would do such a thing naturally. Hide their discoveries until they understood the technology.\u201d\n\u201cWhat technology?\u201d I ask innocently.\nMy comment is ignored, as I had expected it would be.\n\u201cDamascus,\u201d he repeats, chuckling to himself. \u201cIn your day, is that in Syria? Or is it still called Palestine?\u201d A green oval, shaped like a dressing-room mirror, forms behind him, just in front of the door. He disappears through it, his footfalls fading into a familiar rhythm.\nTap tap tap tap tap. Thump... thump... thump...whirrrrrrr...\nThe visage of Mperaganer now strobes by like a zoetrope, fluttering and fading, interspersed with scenes of each encounter a predecessor has had with the strange creature.\n#\nI awaken to the sight of another figure, a face leaning over me. I am prostrated on the divan, a brilliant light like magnesium burning in the background. Yellow eyes pierce the shadow of a faded dark hood. Locutor Tharult greets me.\n\u201cHello, Matthew,\u201d he says, \u201cWelcome to the Olbesiy.\u201d\nI remember the face of Tharult, the wizened leer of a man hungry for the souls of others. Now I understand why my mind is being read. They are monitoring me, the Ancients, watching and waiting. Waiting for me to slip, to remember. And Tharult is working for them. Tharult is the only one who understands the Matrix and me.\n\u201cWhere is Aaron?\u201d\n\u201cI think you know that, Matthew. Why don\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\nI look up into the familiar face of the leader of the Lethian Empire. It has been ages since I last saw him, and it is still too soon....\n#\nJacob called the strange, fluid fabric of consciousness the matriculum mentatis, the Matrix of Minds, and it stretched the ability of a man of his knowledge and epoch to understand. It was a place devoid of time or location, a standing wave of human thought constructed of the very fiber of the universe. The Matrix, I realized, must have seemed to Aaron like God. That was why he still feared it. Aaron\u2019s mind was the first I encountered in the sprawling void. At first, I spoke to him through dreams.\nBut despite its immaterial nature, though, it was simple technology. With a little effort, it could be played like an instrument. The secret I held from Tharult was the fact that I had already mastered that instrument. In time, I would teach other Goldins besides Aaron \u2013 if they didn\u2019t already know. For now, I have to wait.\n\u201cTharult was trying to find the gate,\u201d Aaron murmurs, and I hear him as if he stands next to me. \u201cMperaganer wanted to know if I would tell him its location, or if I would lead him to the person who knew.\u201d\n\u201cDid you?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t recall, but I think, somehow, yes. All I could think of was the divan, but that seemed to be enough. He suspects Palestine now.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d Aaron \u201cshh\u2019d\u201d me and I could sense that his face bore a frown, for I could feel the tension in his jaw and temples.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Aaron. He doesn\u2019t know anything. And besides, those gates pop up everywhere. It\u2019s just that some last longer, for reasons only we know. I could sense Mperaganer\u2019s frustration as he came through the last one. He didn\u2019t even know what year it was.\u201d\nAaron\u2019s body slackened a bit, and I could feel him relax. \u201cI\u2019ll grant that it\u2019s served well to ensure our survival. But we meddle with powerful forces beyond your comprehension. One day it might turn on us. It is like staring down the muzzle of a blunderbuss.\u201d\nI could feel the cold through his waistcoat, and for a moment it surprised me. \u201cYou\u2019re scared.\u201d\nAaron frowned. \u201cI\u2019m cold, Matthew. The fireplace is two rooms away. In your day it\u2019s boarded up.\u201d\nI think about the elaborate ruse that Aaron and I have played on Mperaganer regarding the Pragemon. He is obsessed about it, as he is with Jacob and Joseph, for he seems to think that by finding it \u2013 or them -- he will regain control of something he has long lost. I do not glory in the thought of his anger. The Ancients are still a powerful people, though their number is dwindling. The combination of the two facts has driven them to desperation.\nIt will not be long before he figures out that we have duped him, that we were working together. For now, Aaron is safe, though he must soon learn to defend himself against Mperaganer\u2019s attacks. In the mean time, we must appear scared. Each time he visits, each time Tharult probes, each longsuffering moment of our existence we will need to act stupid. It is demeaning to our proud nature as humans, but we can\u2019t let them know early that we\u2019ve figured out their secret. I look inside my mind, at Aaron, and a gentle thought steals into his mind. \u201cThey will make war, you know. We will have to board up the house.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps.\u201d Aaron\u2019s eyes look out through the shadow of the darkened vestibule and into the night beyond, which is just beginning to clear. What will happen now, he wonders?\nI nod, knowing he can read my thoughts as easily as I can read his. I want Aaron to feel comfortable with our plan, for it is absolutely critical to the survival of our race. \u201cWe will need to track down everyone Mperaganer and his friends have infiltrated,\u201d I say. \u201cRemove the blemish the Ancients have left upon us. The Four Worlds can fend for themselves, and we can deal with Tharult later.\u201d\nI can sense Aaron\u2019s confusion. \u201cHow in heaven\u2019s name do you intend to accomplish that?\u201d he asks out loud, not realizing how silly a non sequitur it would seem to anyone listening.\nI think for a moment, and it occurrs to me quite clearly in this instant why the Goldins are feared. We have learned to conceal our intent.\n\u201cLike we always do. Follow them. Haunt their dreams. Make them twirl and sweat and betangle themselves in their bedsheets until each mind cracks. Once they\u2019re destroyed, we can close the gate.\u201d\n\u201cBut innocent people will die,\u201d he says. He is clearly not comfortable yet. \u201cWe\u2019ll be committing murder. Or at best causing normal minds to suffer such terrible dementia that they would rather pluck out their own eyes than live with what they see.\u201d\nMy eyelids feel heavy, and I need sleep. I embrace Aaron across the void, sympathetically, for I have gone through the process of transformation myself. \u201cIt\u2019s the Ancient\u2019s reality,\u201d I remind him. \u201cWe\u2019ve just lived with nightmares so long that we\u2019ve forgotten their origin. We no longer remember who the Boogey-Men really were.\u201d\n\u201cAre you that certain you know now?\u201d\nI didn\u2019t answer. Aaron was right, of course. It wouldn\u2019t just be murder; it would be genocide. But the thought of purging the Universe of the monsters whose technology had allowed the Matrix, Joseph\u2019s time-portal, the Pragemon, my mind-link and the entire world of nightmare in every human mind was genuinely appealing. It would be some time before he truly understood. I look out across the arm of the same divan I know Aaron is sitting in now, at the same sky, and realize that we are not that different. No one, I once thought, will ever understand why Jacob was such a sonofabitch. But now I do.\nAs it has been since the beginning of time, in a few hours, the green gate will open just outside my front door and Mperaganer, horrible elf that he is, will begin that incessant knocking. I will approach the door \u2013 as Jacob, as Joseph, as Aaron or Matthew or Noah, and I will let him shoot me. I will be afraid, for at least part of the duty of the Grand Masters of Time and AEther is to act as one should in the presence of puffed-up royalty. Let Mperaganer enjoy his feeble illusion of power; let him have his fun. My spirit is lifted with the thought of the adventures that lie ahead. When the time is right, I will open the door and surprise him.\nIt will be happy hunting.","source":"Doc file","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The nephew of a plantation owner has a strange visitor in the middle of the night and can't seem to shake him.

In the corner of the room his last failure\nlay there, almost immobile save for the slow, constant chewing\nmotion of its jaws. He could almost destroy the thing. Dash\nit against the wall. Smash the skull in fury. But for all\nits incongruities, it remained his only example nearing a\nsuccess. For three years he had toiled on the project. He\nwas so close now he could taste it. The abnormal head in the\ncorner was an embarrassment, but it proved that it worked.\nIf he could just get a fresher sample, something where the\nmotor functions of the brain hadn't already deteriorated,\nhe would be fine. Home free. All he needed was a specimen\nand then he would prove them wrong. The echoing laughter he\nhad experienced so many times from so many drove him to a\nheightened frenzy. It had to work; all he needed was the right\nspecimen.\nSuddenly there was a furtive knock at the door, as though\nthe hand was so excited it barely had time to brush the door\nproperly. Mallard opened the door and thrust his head into\nthe room.\n\"Doctor\nquick.\"\nGirtin leapt to his feet and followed Mallard out of the room\nwithout pausing for a coat. The two men rushed out of the\nhospital and into the square. The night was thick with rain\nand although it was still only early evening a heavy, black\ncloud masked the sky and made it feel much later. On the cobbled\nstones of the square a crowd had gathered. From as far as\na hundred yards away Girtin could make out a dark blanket\nbeneath the feet of the crowd. Growing pink in patches as\nthe rain beat it thin against the ground.\nHe got to the scene exhausted and out of breath. He was not\na young man and exercise was not something he believed in,\npreferring to follow more mental pursuits.\n\"Are you the Doctor?\" A man asked him.\n\"Yes\n\" he made out, he had intended to sound\nmore professional but his panting kept him from uttering anything\nother than the one, stilted word.\nSlowly, Girtin fell down next to the body. A single stab wound\nin the chest was clearly visible. The body was unkempt, unshaven,\nhe certainly looked like a vagrant. He was wearing what was\nonce, clearly, a very fine suit, but now it lay in tatters.\nA shadow of its former finery. His face was pale, the rain\nrunning down his face as though he were carved from wax. Girtin\nmade the intended motion of listening for the heartbeat, although\nhe could already tell from the absence of breath that there\nwould be none.\nHe listened closely. Gave a few well-rehearsed nods of the\nhead and looked up at Mallard.\n\"There's a pulse, we have to get him to the Hospital,\nbut be quick.\"\n\"But he's not breathing Doctor.\" One of the crowd\nuttered. Girtin looked at the man, tried to keep a spasm of\nhatred from flashing across his face.\n\"There is a breath\n\" he stammered \"\nbut\nit's shallow.\" He looked over at Mallard again. \"We\nshall have to be fast!\" He added as an afterthought,\nfor emphasis.\nThe two men lifted the body and made off towards the Hospital.\nMost of the crowd began to disperse, the moment of the tragedy\nclearly passed, only a few stragglers remained, desperate\nto gaze at death for a moment longer. It was only natural.\n\"What happened to him anyway?\"\nGirtin spat out the question, the exertion of the run and\nthe weight of the body clearly beginning to take its toll.\n\"No-one was too sure. He was stabbed by another man,\nthe attacker ran off, nobody overheard the discussion.\"\nMallard struggled to keep the body up. \"What does it\nmatter anyway?\"\n\"It is important, my dear Mallard, lest the police should\nask me anything about the man.\" He stopped, catching\nhis breath and looking at Mallard.\nFinally he broke the silence.\n\"Come on,\" the Doctor said. \"Not far to go\nnow.\"\nThey swung open the door to Girtins' room\nand dropped the body to a table. Immediately Girtin picked\nup a heavy bone-saw.\n\"Close the door.\"\nMallard pulled the door to and began to latch it. Before the\ncatch had fallen Girtin had begun slicing into the neck. With\na handful of strong cuts he had the head off and took it over\nto a large glass bell jar. There was a machine attached to\nthe base of the jar and he quickly inserted two tubes into\nthe base of the neck, slipping them firmly inside the veins\nand clamping them on.\n\"How much blood do you want?\" Mallard asked.\n\"Better make it eight pints. I don't want anything to\ngo wrong here, use some of the bodies blood as well.\"\nMallard came over with several brown bottles and began to\nfill a bellows pump with the blood. He also flicked on a large\ngenerator that began to whirr and hum, before quickly settling\ninto a soft, monotonous tone. Girtin had finished with the\ntubes and began to place electrodes along the curve of the\nforehead.\n\"Hammer\nand scalpel.\"\nMallard passed them over and the Doctor made two clumsy incisions\ninto the temples and placed two electrode rods firmly into\nthe holes. He set the head down on the base, and placed the\nglass jar over it, carefully fitting the tubes and wires into\nindentations in the rim of the jar. Mallard had filled the\npump and inserted the tube of an oxygen canister into the\nblood; he carefully twisted the handle, beginning a low hiss.\nThe blood started to pump up one of the tubes, into the neck\nand then out again. The oxygen kept the blood a bright red\nand it spattered against the clear rubber sides of the pump\nas it bubbled. Girtin set the levels for the generator and\nthe two men stood back, looking intently at the jar.\nPerhaps ten minutes passed. There\nwas no sign of movement from the head, but neither man abated\nin their expectation. Every flicker caused by the electrodes\nsent a ripple of excitement down Girtin's spine. Finally,\nit would happen. Never had he seen such a fresh subject and\nsomebody he could so readily use. No-one would ask after the\nvagrant, he even doubted there would be any presence made\nby the police, he had simply put Mallard on the spot with\nhis earlier questioning. That he would soon laugh in the face\nof the entire scientific community was something that drove\nhim on, spurred him to fly in the face of failure. To prove\nthem wrong.\nHis face was tense, every muscle stretched, the skin on his\nown forehead tight and jerking with each movement from the\nhead. Then\nan eyebrow, pulled from an electrical pulse\non the head, continued to move long after the shock had waned.\nGirtin's mouth opened in a silent whisper. Mallard leant closer.\nHis eyes widened more than they were already. The eyebrow\ncontinued to twitch, tugging now at the eyelid and creating\na strange look across the face of the man. As though he were\nin pain, or in the middle of an uncomfortable dream. Girtin's\nhands drew into tight fists, and a mix of dirt and perspiration\nwas squeezed out of the sides.\nSuddenly the mouth of the head burst open in a soft hiss of\na scream, Mallard leapt a little while Girtin remained transfixed.\nThe head finished its scream and slowly closed its mouth,\nlooking around the room as it did so. The eyes fixed themselves\non Girtin and the lips began to move again. The voice was\nso soft that it was vying to be heard against the slow pneumatic\npumping sound of the machinery. Its voice was painfully slow,\neach word seemed to last for an age.\n\"Where\nam\nI\n?\"\nThe two men looked on at this with astonishment. For Mallard,\nhe had never really believed that this would work. This was\nan epiphany for the man. For Girtin, this was the realisation\nof what he knew would work.\nThe head repeated its words, just as slowly and painfully\nas before.\n\"Where\nam\nI\n?\"\nGirtin shook himself out of his trancelike condition.\n\"You're in the hospital, you've been stabbed. Do you\nremember?\"\n\"Of\ncourse\nI\ndo\nthat\nfool\nIgnacio\nwhere\nis\nhe\n?\"\nMallard gripped Girtin by the arm, suddenly awake to the situation\naround him. Excited by the cognition of the head, but disturbed\nby this revelation that it knew its attacker.\n\"This is bad,\" he whispered, \"if he knows the\nman who attacked him there could be repercussions, perhaps\nhe will come looking for him?\"\n\"Don't be absurd.\" Girtin stated, shrugging the\nlittle mans hold from him. He met Mallard's whisper with his\nown. \"This man is a vagrant, his friend was probably\nthe same. Nothing is going to get in the way of this. Do you\nhear me?\"\nMallard resigned himself to the situation and lowered his\nhand. His eyes flicked back to the head which was watching\nthe pair as they talked.\n\"Where\nis\nIgnacio\n?\"\n\"He has fled my friend,\" Girtin stepped forward\nwith the answer.\n\"And\nwhere\nam\nI\nnow\n?\"\n\"In the hospital, as I said.\"\nThe head cast its eyes around the room.\n\"This\ndoes\nnot\nlook\nlike\na\nhospital\n\" With each sentence the\nhead became louder, more sure of itself. Mallard and Girtin\nlooked at each other awkwardly before the assistant spoke.\n\"This is a specialist area. Your wounds were quite severe.\"\n\"Will\nI\nbe\nalright\n?\"\nMallard was speechless. Unsure of what to say next, when Girtin\nsuddenly broke the silence.\n\"Of course you will, nothing a little rest wont cure.\nNow if you'll excuse me, Mr Mallard and I must consult our\nnotes. We will return post-haste.\" The two went to the\ndoor, opening it only barely enough to slip out, in case they\nshould be seen, and made for a secluded area. Mallard produced\na cigarette from a pocket and lit it with a match.\n\"This is bad Girtin, this is bad. Why does the first\nsuccess have to be from a stolen body. There should be an\nauthentic death certificate before we produce the findings\nto the board, without it we are trapped.\"\n\"My friend,\" Girtin smiled now, not a genuine smile,\nbut rather one that was intended to instil faith in his ideas,\n\"you forget that we will be more than able to produce\na death certificate, that is the least of our worries.\"\n\"Well what do we say to him?\"\n\"You worry about what excuses we make for a disembodied\nhead? Why my dear Mallard, you are more pre-occupied with\nyour Catholic guilt than I had previously given you credit\nfor. We can spin any number of stories to him, he will believe\nanything we say and he will become enamoured with us, the\nsurgeons who defied death to save his life.\"\n\"What if he doesn't want to live? What if this Ignacio\nwas a part of some plot to end his suffering, what if he is\ndiseased, what if this Ignacio comes back?\" Girtin approached\nthe man and placed a well-intended hand on his shoulder.\n\"My dear friend. These are a myriad of fantasies. Let\nus deal with every problem as we come to face it, let us not\nget caught up in fanciful notions of 'what if' and the endless\npossibilities tied up therein. Come. We will return to the\nhead. Explain some of what has happened to him, reasonably\nand calmly. We are not grave robbers here, there is no next\nof kin, nothing to draw any unwanted attention to ourselves.\"\nGirtin held Mallard's shoulder firmly until the man appeared\nto reconcile, then he gave him the well-rehearsed shoulder\npatting movements that a man in his position should do and\nslowly ushered him back towards the laboratory.\nThe head switched its eyes over to them as they walked into\nthe room. Something that Mallard was noticeably unsettled\nby.\n\"Ah, there you are,\" Girtin said, \"how are\nyou feeling?\" The head rolled its eyes into the back\nof its head and did not reply. Girtin and Mallard did not\nmove for a moment. The only noise in the room was the pump.\n\"Perhaps the treatment only worked temporarily.\"\nMallard stated.\n\"Poppycock! That creature in the corner manages little\nto no response and yet it's been that way for two months now.\"\nThe two men stared at the head until the eyes rolled back\nout again and it intoned.\n\"My\nmouth\nis\ndry\n\" Instinctively\nMallard rushed over to a jug of water in the corner and filled\na glass.\n\"Don't be a damn fool man, he can't drink that.\"\n\"He can at least wet his lips. He's still alive after\nall.\" Girtin waved the comment away and turned to the\nwindow whilst Mallard took the glass over to the head. He\nlifted the bell jar and dabbed a little water onto the lips.\n\"Thank\nyou\n\" the head said, smacking\nits lips together softly, the skin sticking a little from\nthe moisture. Girtin came over to the pair.\n\"Now that we've finished our charity work perhaps we\ncan ask you a few questions.\" Mallard set the jar back\nover the head, again taking care that the tubes were all placed\nin the grooves. The head blinked its eyes at Girtin as if\nto give its permission for questions to be asked.\n\"What is your name my friend?\" Girtin adopted his\nmost appeasable bedside manner for the questions.\n\"My\nname\nis\nCozens\n\" Girtin\ngave a sincere nod.\n\"And would anyone know you are here Cozens?\" The\nhead seemed to contemplate this question.\n\"No\none\nwould\nknow\nI\nam\nhere\n\" Girtin tried to hide his excitement\nat this response. Mallard appeared visibly uncomfortable about\nthe line of questioning.\n\"What about Ignacio, is there anything you can tell us\nabout him?\"\n\"Enough of this Girtin, tell him why he is here.\"\nA flash of anger passed over the Doctors face, Cozens looked\nback and forth at the pair. \"The time for this charade\nhas passed, tell him what has happened.\" Cozens looked\ndisturbed by this.\n\"Why\nam\nI\nhere\n?\nI\nthought\nI\nwas\nstabbed\n\"\nGirtin quickly replaced the look of anger with one of concern\nagain.\n\"Indeed you were Cozens, but your injuries were a little\nmore severe than we first let on.\"\nThe machinery pumped away in the room. Outside the sound of\nhorses' hooves beat a tattoo against the cobbled streets.\n\"Will\nI\nbe\nalright\n?\"\nthe head repeated its earlier question. This time Mallard\nspoke out with the response.\n\"Cozens, you were\nvery badly hurt in the attack.\nYou did not make a recovery ... and at roughly five thirty\nin the evening\nyou passed away.\"\nEverything was very still in the room. Suddenly the loudest\nsound seemed to be that of the air passing in and out of Cozens'\nmouth. The water on his lips had dried and a thin crust had\nbuilt up. What looked like a line of spittle had grown in\nthe corner of his mouth.\n\"But\nI\nam\nspeaking\nto\nyou\nnow\n\" the head appeared understandably\nconfused by the revelation. \"How\ncan\nthis\nbe\n?\"\n\"We have a series of electrical impulses to stimulate\nyour brain, added to this we circulate oxygenated blood through\nyour\nuh, head, to keep you responsive. We've done this\na number of times but with little to no degree of success,\nso far as mental re-stimulation is concerned. You are our\nfirst\ntalking\nspecimen.\"\n\"\nSpecimen\n?\n\" Girtin stepped in\nto Mallard's explanation.\n\"What we mean to say is that we have tried to\nsave,\na number of people. So far you are the only person we have\nmanaged to rescue.\"\n\"\nWhy\nme\n?\" Cozens intoned. He\nrolled his eyes back into his head again, then spoke. His\nvoice was more cracked than before, as though he were upset\nor in pain. \"\nWhat\ndid\nmy\nwife\nsay\n?\"\nBoth men froze. Their breathing halted for a moment. Only\nthe sound of the pneumatics could be heard. Then, slowly,\nGirtin swallowed long and loud, his Adams apple bobbing awkwardly.\n\"Your wife?\" The question hung there in the air,\nunanswered, as Cozens seemed to move in and out of another\ntrance. Finally, he came round again.\n\"\nShe\nwas\nsupposed\nto\nmeet\nme\nin\nthe\nsquare\n\" Cozens\ntook several long, deep (and totally unnecessary) breaths\nbefore continuing. \"\nThat\nwas\nwhen\nI\nmet\nthat\ndamn\nfool\nIgnacio\n\"\nMallard looked over at Girtin who simply continued to stare\nat the head in despair. If there was a wife then there was\na next of kin and there would be questions. After all this\ntime, he thought he had been so careful, yet now he could\nfind himself stripped of his qualifications. Hounded out of\nthe medical establishment, thrown out for a crime that none\nof his peers could condone. He felt the very air in the room\ngrowing cold. Outside Mallard became aware of a growing noise,\na clamour of some description, but no matter how important\nit was he could not tear himself away from this moment. Everything\nthey had worked so hard for was crumbling around their ears.\nThe wife would be looking for him, would hear what had happened\nand there were far more witnesses than they had accounted\nfor. Stealing a body from the street. What were they thinking?\nMallard turned to Girtin.\n\"This has to stop now! We have to destroy all of the\nevidence of what we have done, quick, lets take the head and\nthe body to the furnace. If there is no evidence nothing can\nbe proven against us.\"\n\"No! I have come too far, worked too long at this to\nburn my only success.\"\n\"Be reasonable man. There is no committee on Earth whom\nyou can take this\nhead to, without drawing yourself\nwithin a conspiracy. You have to let this one go. We know\nthe process works, lets burn this one and get on to the next\nsubject.\"\nGirtin looked at Cozens fondly now. Seeing him not just as\nhis triumph, but as a poor individual who had become embroiled\nin something that destroyed him.\n\"But without the treatment Cozens would have died, this\nway his wife gets to look upon him again, to speak with him\nagain.\"\n\"As a disembodied head!? There is no one in all the land\nwho is going to see this as an act of mercy. No one who will\nread into the facts of the matter anything other than the\ngreed of two men that defied all rational thought. All reason.\nWe will not be championed for what we have done today. We\nwill be demonised, imprisoned. There is not even any evidence\nto suggest that we did not kill Cozens ourselves, to further\nthe experiment.\"\n\"But that is not true.\"\n\"Well at the least, we will be accused of grave-robbing,\nor brought up on similar charges. Treated as insane, bloodthirsty\ncreatures, instead of Doctors.\" Girtin's head was swimming\nnow, as though he had just been on the carousel, he was giddy\nwith worry. \"Come, I am going to destroy the evidence.\nYou will thank me for this, whether you realise it now or\nnot.\"\n\"\nAm\nI\nto\npresume\nthat\nI\nhave\nout\nlived\nmy\npurpose\n?\"\nNeither man answered Cozens. Mallard slowly walked towards\nhim and began to take apart the pumps. Girtin felt the blood\nrush to his head, felt his face darken. Everything he had\nworked for, so many years, so much time, no success, apart\nfrom Cozens, and now, this.\n\"No!\"\nHe rushed towards Mallard and swept him away with an arm,\nknocking him to the ground. Mallard had fallen on his front\nand was just beginning to stand when Girtin dropped another\nbell jar onto his head. Mallard wouldn't get up again.\nAt that moment a ferocious knocking began at the door.\n\"Doctor Girtin, this is the police, we need to speak\nto you immediately.\"\nGirtin turned to the door, the blood fell from his face and\nhe turned pale, almost translucent.\n\"\nIt\nlooks\nlike\nI\nshould\nconsider\nyou\nmy\nsaviour\ntwice\nnow\nI\nam\nindebted\nbut\nI\nfear\nthat\nyou\nshould\npay\nfor\nyour\ncrimes\n\"\nGirtin studied Cozens' face, seeing now a cruelty behind his\nthin smile. The door to the room burst open.\n\"Good God!\"\nThe policeman looked around the room in terror. On the floor\nlay the body of Mallard, shattered glass lay all around him,\nseveral shards were embedded in his head, his blood was still\nspreading around him. There were two heads in bell jars, one\nof them was moving, the other lay still. He had never encountered\nanything quite like this. Girtin stood in the centre of the\nroom, visibly shaken by what had happened.\n\"It's not what it looks like! I can explain everything.\"\nGirtin began to babble and shake. The policeman approached\nhim slowly. Behind him another policeman entered the room\nand turned an ash grey.\n\"What the devil happened here?\"\n\"It's the head. His name is Cozens, I was trying to save\nhim, I brought him back. Just ask him\"\nThe two policemen looked over at the head moving its jaw.\n\"Not that one. The other head.\" Girtin walked over\nto Cozens and spoke to him. \"Tell them what happened.\"\nCozens did not move. \"Tell them what happened!\"\nGirtin yelled at the head now, slamming his fists down on\nthe table, causing the bell jar to rattle. The two policemen\nlooked at each other. The one who was first to enter the room\nrolled his eyes at the other, without Girtin seeing.\n\"Perhaps you could tell us exactly what happened down\nat the station?\" He took Girtin by the hand and, stepping\nlightly, led him away.\nThe\nEnd","source":"http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20051030150806\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/aprjun2003\/reconstitutedwealth.htm","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/qUL6KrNLmaKiEFTOiCZeFtspfT8.json","volume":4.0,"issues":2.0,"has_text":true}

The black night sky gave way to\na hazy blue glow as the bolts shot towards the dwellings and began to set them\nablaze in groups of half a dozen. Then there was screaming, and naked\nfigures tearing out of their homes; most of them seemed to be children. On\ncommand, four of our junior officers were sent in, each covered from afar by\ntwo of their subordinates, while the rest of our rank kept watch\nfor surprise attacks from nearby wooded areas. Our point men\ndispatched the enemy in a blaze of blue light and agonized yells; it was all\nover in less than a minute. A few injured warriors were taken captive, and the\nwomen and children were all rounded up within the hour. There were no\ncasualties on our side.\nIt was as tight an operation as any officer had pulled off in the rough\nareas of Hopping Foot country for at least a year, and this time, that officer\nwas me. I felt good for the first time in months, but I knew it wouldn't last.\nIt never does.\nThat hazy sense of despair - all the worse because I can never track its\norigin - came upon me again rather quickly this time, only the morning after\nthe battle. The sub-commandant of Jruuf's regiment and I were sitting next to\nthe makeshift prisoner's pen, watching the defeated Hopping Foots squirm on\nthe cold ground and chatter in their quick, indecipherable dialect. I\nhad just given our captives the usual speech, through a translator for the\nbenefit of their women, who are kept mostly ignorant, about how they would be\nsheltered and fed, then turned over to the re-educators to be taught the ways\nof Skri'.\nThe sub-commandant turned to me with an ugly smirk on his face.\n\"Look, Navaki, look at that Hopping Feces over there, he sure looks like\nhe thinks he's tough, you know? Hey, Hopping Feces,\" he yelled, pointing\nat the prisoner in question, who was sitting with his legs crossed and wearing\na defiant expression on his face, \u201cWho controls you now? You don't run free\nno more, ha ha!\"\nBut the captive warrior, who obviously understood our tongue, did not\nseem perturbed in the least. In fact, he looked to be glowing with\nsatisfaction - and it was then that I noticed that I was not, though our\nsituations should have ensured the reverse.\nWhy wasn't I content even after my greatest victory? I had always been\nof the mind that a man would find happiness only through pursuing his\npassions; my passion was soldiering. So I emulated the heroes that we were\ntold of as children - stories that Skri' the Great Fallen Snake had taught our\npeople so that we might use the New Ways with wisdom and not foolishness - and\nI had \"conquered the ignorant mammals\", as the tale goes.\nYet the next evening, when our three regiments arrived back at glorious\nFirebird to march the captives to re-education camps and take our weapons to\nthe Charger, I knew I'd be forced to find solace, as usual, at Macao's Tavern.\nMacao's was a classy establishment ina classy town (the others of the\nEmpire are still composed mostly of cliff apartments with old-style pueblo\ndwellings thrown around for variety). It had great corn liquor - my favorite\nof the advancements brought by Skri' - and a reputation as the center of\nFirebird's decadent upper-class scene. Its patrons consisted mostly of high\ntechnicians, well-off students, and the idle rich -all of those classes made\npossible by the arrival of Skri' and the Lessening of the Toil that followed.\nAfter a quick bath and a change of clothes, I made my way through the\ncity streets, passing through the crowds, an interesting mix of urban\ntechnocrats talking on portable com phones and rural farmers without the least\nidea of how one works. At one point, I stopped to gaze out into the distance\nwhere, towering over the city, the vessel of Skri\u2019 was raised out over the\nhorizon, blinking lights giving off a constant assurance that the power source\nour Empire is built on was still secure. For some reason, this had always been\na concern of mine. Miracles, after all, are the \u201crealm of the gods\u201d \u2013\nand the gods are fickle.\nI finally got to Macao's to find that news of our victory had already spread\nthrough Firebird. My arrival was met with general congratulations from various\nacquaintances and strangers, and suddenly I felt better - which just made\neverything worse.\nThe disturbing question flashed through my mind. I've always considered myself\nan individualist -self-motivated, unreliant on the opinions of others. Why,\nthen, had I felt so empty until the compliments began to pour in?\nLonging for distraction, I ordered the house special, then sipped it lovingly\nwhile I stood scanning the crowd with my back to the wall, waiting\nfor the release the liquor would bring me. But my eyes stopped suddenly when I\nsaw who was sitting at the corner table in the back. It was Isandlana. I gulped\ndown the rest of the drink.\nTezkaki was sitting with her - unsurprising. He was dressed like a\nmiddle-aged auditor (a habit he had acquired during his younger years, when\nhis ridiculously doting mother used to dress him up), just as he had been\nattired the last time I had seen the two of them, almost three months earlier\nwhen they had returned from the University in Black Mesa for the Winter\nSolstice holidays. Isandlana was, as usual, the epitome of well-bred class and\nbeauty, and just as rich as she appeared.\nI bought another drink and walked over to their table. As I approached\nthey noticed me and looked me over, Tezkaki with affected nonchalance and barely detectable apprehension, Isandlana with a glance so mischievous, and at\nthe same time lustful, that I knew our \"game\" was not yet over.\nTezkaki spoke first, and as he did so he smiled in a strange fashion, from\nwhich I ascertained he had taken a strategy of offense veiled in friendly\nbanter. This was common with him. The goal, of course, was to belittle me in\nfront of Isandlana; he hadn't done it in the old days, before she had come\nalong, when we had been friends and classmates.\n\"So,\" he began, \"I hear you conquered another Hopping Feces\nvillage. How many warriors did they have this time? Three? With clubs?\"\nWe both laughed at the nationalistic insult.\n\"Just about,\" I replied good-naturedly. But Tezkaki, like many\ncivilians, under-estimate the challenge of dealing with those who have been\nhardened by living in the ways of Nature. There had been forty warriors; their\nvillage had been decorated with skulls. As I talked to him,\nI began to realize how drunk Tezkaki really was. He shifted between insulting\nme and giving me advice in a manner that would befit an elder, experienced in\nthe ways of the world. But he was not. Over the next hour he admonished me for\ndropping out of the University, for picking a profession that was below me\nintellectually, for associating with women of bad reputation, and for still\nusing the mind-altering Titsu weed (to which I pointed out that he was\ndrinking, and heavily).\nWhen he got up to order a drink and exchange pleasantries with some friends at\nanother table, Isandlana turned tome with large dark eyes and asked me, with a\nhint of confusion, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you playing the game?\u201d\n\u201cWasn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u201cNo. You weren\u2019t even paying attention to me.\u201d\nAnd I hadn\u2019t been.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot on my mind.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you like playing with me anymore?\u201d\nThe \u201cgame\u201d had started two years ago, during one of those phases I must\nendure every year or so when I lose the emotional capacity to apply myself to\nanything. This one was to last several months. I spent the days smoking Titsu\nwith my friends, including Tezkaki, who had just instigated a sexual\nrelationship with Isandlana. We had met her only recently, but both of us\nquickly saw what set her apart from many other girls \u2013she was independent,\nor at least somewhat so; she was intelligent, motivated, and, best of all to\nour young, nihilistic minds, she was an ardent cynic and hedonist. Some\ndescribed her as a beautiful young girl, others as a spoiled bitch, and they\nwere both right.\nThe\n\u201cgame\u201d was a result of the strong sexual tension that arose soon after\nIsandlana and I began our own relationship, which manifested only sporadically\nand became known to Tezkaki a couple of months after it began, and then only\nbecause Isandlana told him (apparently without malice or apology, thrown\ncasually into a conversation over lunch).\nThe news crushed Tezkaki, who quickly declared his love for Isandlana and\nproposed that they be monogamous from then on. He became rife with outbursts\nof emotion and long, drunken speeches, filled with pretension and theatrics\nsuch as none else can put forth (he had always enjoyed these kinds of\norations, but now they came about constantly). He immediately stepped up his\ndrinking, which was fairly bad already, and our friendship slowly tainted as a\nkind of stealthy competition sprung up between us for the affections of\nIsandlana.\nOut\nof that competition grew what Isandlana called \u201cthe game\u201d, the complex\nsparring and flirtation that went on among the three of us almost every day\nafterwards, at taverns, at school, at festivals.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you like playing with me anymore?\u201d Isandlana asked me\nagain when I didn\u2019t respond. I didn\u2019t know, so I gave a reason that really\ndidn\u2019t concern me.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a game to Tezkaki. He\u2019s jealous, and it\u2019s bad for him to\nhave to worry about you and I.\u201d Which was true enough.\nOur conversation was cut short when Tezkaki returned to the table, obviously\nmore drunk and in a better mood.\n\u201cNavaki,\u201d he said to me, \u201cyou should see these student\n\u2018revolutionaries\u2019 at the University. I swear, they\u2019re the dregs of\nthe gene pool. Every fourth day\nthey hold demonstrations \u2013 lousy ones, all they do is chant and make poor\nspeeches, the worst speeches you\u2019ve ever heard, pretentious as all hell. And\nthen there\u2019s the bunch that goes out on \u2018spiritual retreats\u2019 to speak to\ntheir \u2018animal selves\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going on a spiritual retreat. Tomorrow.\u201d\nI had not been. I didn\u2019t know why I made the decision just then.\nBoth of them looked at me, Tezkaki with amusement, Isandlana with\ninterest.\n\u201cTell me you\u2019re kidding, Navaki. That\u2019s superstition.\u201d\n\u201cMost of it is, surely. I don\u2019t really believe that the \u2018animal\nselves\u2019, or what have you, are actually \u2018god-like beings\u2019. You\nknow humanity existed for perhaps 2 million years before the coming of Skri\u2019.\nSurely, in that time, though they probably didn\u2019t have anything we would see\nas technology, they made some kinds of discoveries about the mind. I think\nthese manifestations are messages from the subconscious \u2013 something that can\ntap into\u2026 into Nature.\u201d\n\u201cNavaki,really\u2026 if\nthere was some kind of \u2018mechanism\u2019 that allows for perception outside the\nrealm of our senses, Skri\u2019 would have told us.\u201d\n\u201cTezkaki, Idon\u2019t think he knew.\u201d\n\u201cNow,really!\u201d\n\u201cListen! You\u2019ve studied the Annals. He was wise in the ways of\nscience, that is true, but only the science of his own people. He never\nstudied the human\nmind, he wasn\u2019t interested.\u201d\nBut Tezkaki wasn\u2019t convinced. We debated the question for an hour, drinking\nmore all the while, till Macao\u2019s closed in the early morning. Before\nmy friends left, Isandlana took me aside.\n\u201cI want to hear how it turns out. Good night.\u201d\nBut I didn\u2019t go to sleep that night. Instead I prepared some belongings into\na pack and began my long walk to the village of Round Rock. I stopped only\nonce during that day, to drink some water from a creek I remembered playing in\nas a child. I hadn\u2019t eaten the day before, and I didn\u2019t eat that day. It\nwas important that I release all impurities.\nIt was already night when I reached my destination. There were a few fires\ngoing and several figures around each one, presumably listening to\nthe ancient tales of our people. Very rustic. My arrival, and presumably\nmy Firebird-style garments, prompted curious stares from the villagers. Some\nof\nthem even seemed to be amused.\nI asked a question of one of the locals and was directed to a very small\npueblo structure on the edge of the village. I went in without knocking, as is\nthe custom in these backwards villages, and found a man who was very shriveled\nand old, so much so as to be almost clich\u00e9.\nWhen I came in, he began speaking without looking up.\n\u201cIn the past, there was a tribe of our people who sought to escape the\nnight, as it was filled with terrible creatures and unknown dangers. So they\nbegan\nwalking, as much as man\u2019s energy allows for, starting every morning at the\nbreak of dawn. They hoped they could outrun the night and remain in\nperpetual\nsunlight. But they could not, and every evening, night came upon them once\nmore. Finally, they realized that they were attempting the impossible.\nThat day, they built homes, invented fire, and learned to make weapons. Now\nthey could deal with the night and what it brings.\u201d\nHe knew why I had come.\n\u201cYou have been purified?\u201d he asked me, finally looking up.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cYou will not be killed by the fear?\u201d\n\u201cI am strong.\u201d\n\u201cYou are sad.\u201d\n\u201cIt is possible to be both.\u201d\n\u201cMay you fare well in your journey.\u201d\nWith that, he reached into one of several clay jars and pulled out a\nhuge fistful of dried mushrooms. I knew the type from recreation in my younger\nyears (of course it was frowned upon by most conservatives who believe them\nfit only for religious ceremonies). They were the most potent variety of\n\u2018celestial mushroom\u2019 known to our people, and it was a dose the strength\nof which could drive a man mad if he failed to maintain control over his mind.\nI took the fungi and chewed them with distaste.\n\u201cRemember,\u201dthe old man said as I was leaving a few minutes later, the\njuices of the plant having begun their effects, \u201cbravery sustained our\npeople through\na trying age. Things haven\u2019t changed with this one.\u201d\nI marched out of the village, into the plains. The feeling washed over me as I\nmade my way through Nature, my mind charged like a laser.\nThe few trees I saw in the distance began to take on their own identities;\nsoon they were speaking to me, all at once, and it seemed they spoke of\nnothing but trifles.\nThen I was sitting among the dry bushes, and they seemed to surround me. It\nsuddenly occurred to me that there were snakes here and there,\nwithin striking distance; and I could hear bugs, huge buzzing horseflies\nswooping around me. All at once, I was as frightened as I had ever been. It\nwas the kind of terror so bad that you rail against the turn of events that\nled you to face it, and you denounce the laws of physics themselves in the\nback of your mind while your conscious mind is paralyzed.\nAnd then I stood up and yelled the yell of a warrior, with my fists clenched\nhigh above my head. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of it!\u201d My declaration echoed\nall around, tearing across the planes like a wave.\nAnd the fear was gone.\nI yelled again and tore a young hardwood plant out of the ground by its\nstalk, swung it around my head while I screamed out warnings to non-existent\nfoes, then threw it into the darkness and fell to the ground laughing.\n\u201cThedifficulty of life is over.\u201d\nI sprung to my feet and looked at the speaker with amazement.\nIt was a cat, white as the clouds. And it made sense.\n\u201cWhy was I so sad?\u201d I asked him, knowing he knew.\n\u201cYou had forgotten what you were living for. Without realizing it, you saw\nyour life\u2019s work as a useless, even hurtful thing.\u201d\n\u201cYes. But I don\u2019t now. Why?\u201d\n\u201cSearch your mind.\u201d\nI did, and it was as if he had asked to me to jump forwards or lift my arm.\n\u201cThough it involves warfare,\u201d I said at length, with sudden understanding,\n\u201cthe conquest of other tribes in order to establish the code of Skri\u2019 is\nactually good for humanity, as it will bring peace and prosperity.\u201d\n\u201cYes. The division of humanity into small family groups with a philosophy\nbased on tradition does not allow man to achieve his full potential. Skri\u2019\nis not a god, but he has brought reason \u2013 and that is just what humanity\nneeds.\u201d The cat jumped onto a felled tree and began to scratch his\nears as he talked. \u201cThere is some wisdom among these peoples you conquer,\nhowever. And there is another reason for you to be proud of your work.\u201d\n\u201cIncredible,\u201dI let out, as I realized what that reason was.\n\u201cThe men from faraway lands will arrive on the continent in 300 years,\u201d\nthe cat explained. \u201cWithout a unified Empire, educated and powerful, the\npeople of\nyour lands will be mostly wiped out.\u201d He paused to lick his paws.\nThen, \u201cWithout a passion in life, you had no passion for life. So the\ngood things didn\u2019t interest you. Things like women.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s over now. And I have to leave.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecauseyou\u2019re going to spend the next 4 hours vomiting like a drunken\nschoolgirl.\u201d\nThe cat left.\nAnd I spent the next four hours vomiting like a drunken schoolgirl. I\nawoke the next morning feeling indescribable, though my mouth tasted\nbad. I looked out on Nature, considering the infinite possibilities. I felt\ngood.\nAnd I set off to go see Isandlana.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050903212707\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/janmar2001\/anasazi.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The Internet's Premier Magazine of Historical Science Fiction","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/EafaHtamxkDtjLEY6eEXwmbP2IQ.json","volume":2.0,"issues":1.0,"has_text":true}

Now however, with shadows firmly in tow, I hailed\na taxi, gave him the directions and ignored his odd looks\nas we rambled through the sun-dappled streets of Hampton,\na place I had once looked to for a new beginning and now was\nquite relieved to leave behind.\nThe journey was longer than I had anticipated and the crude\nroads, carved it seemed by some novice god's trembling hand\nfrom unyielding limestone, conspired with foul and unhappy\nmemory to siphon from my soul some of the good spirit I had\nbeen so glad to entertain thus far.\nWe crested a serpentine path and the emerald green landscape\nrolled away from us, the taxi driver (an odious emigrant with\nsome unpronounceable handle) quick to inform me how odd it\nwas for someone to request passage through this hostile and\nwild terrain.\n\"Doesn't Mr. Blame call on you to ferry him to and fro?\"\nI asked and waited an eternity for him to respond.\n\"Neh,\" he eventually replied and shrugged his shoulders.\n\"No-one come here. No-one leef here.\"\n\"Except Mr. Blame.\"\n\"You say so.\"\nI was loath to continue our banter, even though it had taken\nmy thoughts, however briefly, from Hapsbury Manor and all\nits inherent ugliness.\n\"Haven't you ever seen him?\"\nI enquired, a hand braced against the door to keep myself\nfrom being jostled up through the roof.\nAgain a shrug. \"I tole you. No one here. You come visit.\nYou leef here.\"\nThe celestial spotlight so helpful in illuminating the solution\nto my quandary had faded and now thick iron-colored clouds\nroiled in the air above the vehicle.\nGlass beads of rain speckled the window, blurring the landscape\nand so it was that Blame's house was almost on top of us before\nI saw it.\nThe driver pulled the vehicle to a squealing halt and muttered\nsomething over his shoulder. Without knowing what it was he\nhad attempted to divulge, I stuffed his grimy fist full of\nnotes and exited the taxi. A tobacco-stained grin informed\nme that our business was concluded and he drove away, leaving\nme draped in the shadow of Caldwell's magnificent house.\nBuilt by his father, a tyrannical brute by the name of Hanson,\nit was a deceptively simple-looking structure. Rectangular\nas it rose but distended towards the roof by the protruding\nminiature turrets on all four corners, it resembled a shrunken\ncastle. I recalled Caldwell's concurrence when I had used\na similar metaphor in speaking of the building.\n\"My father would have built himself a castle, had he\nbeen in a position to afford such a thing. I sometimes think\nhe believed himself a king.\"\nLooking at the splendiferous structure, just a few rooms shy\nof a manor; I had no difficulty in believing such a thing.\nThe medieval pretense was spoiled only slightly by\nmore modern touches. New glass windows and electric lighting\nbroke the illusion of antiquity as soon as one bore close\nenough to examine the Blame house more carefully.\nWith the sky above me rumbling and peering darkly around the\ngables, I resolved to get indoors as quickly as possible,\nnot only for shelter but also to be reacquainted with the\nmajesty of the house and my good friend, Caldwell.\nThe heavy brass knocker resisted me at first but with a final\nshuddering groan it allowed itself to be moved and I hammered\nit down upon the rusted plate. The resultant clamor resounded\nhollowly within the confines of the house and I shifted uncomfortably\nfrom foot to foot as I awaited acknowledgement.\nBut to my surprise and disappointment, none came.\nUnwilling as I was to simply give up trying to rouse some\nsign of life within the cold stone walls of the place, I thumped\nthe door with renewed force. It had also come to mind that\nI had not requested that the taxi return to collect me. I\ndidn't relish the thought of being stranded alone in an unoccupied\nhouse in the mountains.\nThe echoes continued with apparently no ears to hear them\nand I was filled with unease. Struggling not to panic, I made\nmy way through the bramble-choked garden around to the back\nof the house. I was greeted with only more darkness and silence.\nHow lucky was I then that the front door should be standing\najar when I returned to the face of the building?\nAny curious fear such a thing might have incurred in me was\nforgotten as I rushed in from the cold and the deepening dark\nand called out the name of my would-be host.\nThe hallway was crowded with ghosts.\nThe gnarled hand of despair forced my shoulders down as I\nsurveyed my surroundings, the furniture draped in white drop\ncloths, the floor covered in plastic sheeting, no light, no\nscent of habitation.\nAlone. Draft-bidden dust swirled in the gloom like shifting\nmemories and I shook my head, all trace of my good humor and\nexcitement now banished and smothered beneath the drop cloths.\nOverhead, the muffled sound of God's hammer striking the Heavens\nthundered down through the stone and I shivered. For now,\nwhat had been to my bruised mind an escape to freedom appeared\nmore cage-like than any of the fears I had entertained.\nIn fact it seemed if anything, I had stumbled upon a place\nthat encouraged loneliness and whispered despair from its\nmany cracks and holes.\nThe door groaned shut and I was left to ponder this quandary\nin the dusty hall.\nPresently, I warmed myself with the knowledge that should\nit become necessary, Hampton was less than ten miles away.\nCertainly not a jaunt for a gentleman but a gentleman in the\ncompany of dust and age ceases being proud when there are\nno eyes to judge him.\nWith a sigh that caused the curtain of dust to whirl around\nme, I ventured forth into the living room.\n\"I dream of men with guns,\" a voice said and I jumped,\nstartled.\nI followed the sound of what must surely be Caldwell's voice\nand saw a high-backed chair, covered in sheeting but facing\nthe fireplace.\n\"Caldwell?\"\n\"But not any kind of gun I've ever seen in reality. These\nare surely futuristic devices, monstrous inventions that allow\nthe bearer to unleash pure plasma beams, instantly turning\nthe enemy to dust. Can you comprehend the significance of\nsuch a thing?\"\nBecause of his tone, in which it appeared I was not the one\nhe addressed at all, but rather some unseen guest lurking\nin the shadows, I slowly made my way around to the side of\nthe chair. I was filled with a sudden sense of dread before\nI came face to face with my old friend.\nCaldwell had aged terribly and I caught my breath at the sight\nof his thinning hair and haggard face. Odder still, even though\nI now stood staring by his side was that it seemed he had\nyet to notice me.\n\"Of course not,\" he continued. \"How could we\npossibly understand anything of the future? Our narrow minds\nprevent us from exploring the boundaries and limitations of\nour own untapped intellect. But there will be changes and\nthese changes will bring about the end of everything.\"\nI put a hand on his wrist and he flinched and looked up at\nme, fear making a horrid mask of his face. \"Don't touch\nme!\" he shrieked and I swear his eyes glowed. But\nthat of course was impossible and I gather my fatigue exaggerated\na lot of what I saw that day.\nCaldwell sneered and turned his attention back to the fireplace,\nhis chest sinking with a heavy sigh.\nI pondered my options for it now seemed quite clear that my\nunfortunate friend had, by whatever cruel twist of circumstance,\nfallen prey to madness; a unique brand of insanity in which\nhe believed himself a prophet of an evil and technologically\nadroit future. That he would start at the lightest of touches\nshocked and saddened me but, perhaps goaded by my newfound\nisolation, I deigned to arouse in him recognition, however\nslight.\n\"Caldwell? It's me! Robert.\"\nHe gave me no sign that he had heard, but I continued undaunted.\n\"Your old college buddy, Caldwell. Robert Hayes!\"\nLicking his lips, he nodded and a faint spark of hope coruscated\nacross my weary mind, only to be quenched almost immediately\nwhen he spoke again.\n\"There's a man in my basement.\"\nI sighed and moved ever so carefully, slowly around toward\nthe fireplace. \"What?\"\n\"His hours are unusual but I'm gradually figuring him\nout. He comes when I sleep, or at least when he thinks I should\nbe sleeping.\"\n\"Who is he?\" I asked, deciding that if rational\nconversation were no longer valid then perhaps joining in\nthe madness might yield some answers.\n\"Oh he's a most awful thing, a ghastly visitor. I know\nhe doesn't belong here but I'm afraid to send him home. Afraid\nbecause of what it might do to us. To our home.\"\nMy despair plumbed new depths the longer he spoke and I wondered\nif I should summon help to the mausoleum the Blame Manse had\nbecome. Caldwell was lost to me, that much was evident. The\nskeletal figure in the chair before me neither acted nor spoke\nlike my old friend and my grief at his loss had already sprouted.\nIt was then I noticed his hands. Or rather, the peculiar object\nhe held in them.\nA slim black rectangular object with a series of opaque glass\nbuttons running down the middle. At the top, a gray, segmented\nstrip periodically lit amber. It was the most unusual item\nand I found myself wondering what race or obscure civilization\nCaldwell had stumbled on in his travels to acquire such an\nodd keepsake. But even as I wondered, I realized the object\nwas not something to which the term 'obscure' could be applied.\nIf anything, it looked more advanced than anything I'd ever\nset eyes upon -- a toy perhaps, something Caldwell had manufactured\nto add credence to his own delusions.\n\"What is that unusual-looking thing?\" I asked eventually,\nunable to stop myself.\n\"It belongs to him,\" he whispered as if he feared\nhis 'visitor' should overhear. \"I took it from him the\nnight I crept up on him. He thought I was asleep you see but\nI had been in hiding for hours. I knocked him out cold when\nhe appeared and took this thing from him, keeping him here\nand all of us safe.\"\nI frowned down at him, wishing he would\nspare me a glance not brimful of malice. \"Keeping him\nhere? Then from where has he come?\"\nCaldwell sniffed and put a hand over the strange object. \"The\nsame place you have, the future. The same bloody place all\nof you bloody strangers come from.\" He was growing more\nexcitable by the second. \"Tomorrow, next year, next month,\nnext week. Anywhere but where people are supposed to come\nfrom which is now! And I have to keep you all here or our\nworld will be destroyed. Why is that so bloody difficult for\nall of you to understand? I can't let you return or you'll\nknock normality off of its axis and where will we find ourselves\nthen?\"\nI raised a hand to calm him and he snapped his head toward\nme. \"Which one are you from? Which new order? Which time?\nWhat bloody year spawned you?\"\nTo my surprise, he jumped to his feet and backed away, his\neyes as wide as full moons, teeth bared, skin pulled taut\nover the harassed skull beneath. He jabbed a threatening finger\nat me. \"I know! I know what it is you people have done\nto our world in the whenever and I won't allow it.\"\nHe smiled grimly. \"Caldwell Blame, prosperous and secure,\nsuddenly finds himself in the position of gatekeeper for all\nthe eldritch dimensions science has kept a secret from us.\nWill history be ready to remember one from its own time once\nthey discover this?\"\nI shook my head. \"Caldwell, old friend. I don't know\nwhat you're talking about. Who is the man in the basement?\"\n\"Why don't you go see for yourself?\nHe doesn't have long more.\"\nHe stood there then, breathing huge gasps of air and staring\nat me with hatred seething on his gaunt features. And then\nhe retook his seat and began to whisper. \"Go see. Tell\nhim you were unable to get it from me.\"\nI ignored him and searched the dusty vault of my memory for\ndirections to the basement.\n*\nIt transpired that Caldwell hadn't been\nentirely delusional after all.\nOn descending the rickety stairs into the basement, I saw\nthat there was indeed a man below. At this point however,\nmy addled friend's mind had ceased reporting from reality.\nThe man in the basement was dead and by the look of him, had\nbeen for some time.\nWhat caused a ripple of unease in my composure was not so\nmuch the sight or smell of the body but the clothes adorning\nthe corpse. From them I could see the extent of Caldwell's\nmadness for surely it was he who dressed the dead man in such\ncurious robes, the likes of which I had never seen or have\never seen since.\nHad he also administered the unconventional haircut and the\nstrange silver carvings that studded the man's ears? And what\nof the spectacles?\nIt was most unsettling and the longer I stood studying the\nprone man on the dusty floor, the more disturbed I became.\nWhat kind of a theatrical madness had descended upon Blame\nthat he should construct an alternate reality within the confines\nof his home? And who was his mysterious visitor?\nInstinct and better judgment begged me to leave immediately\nand heeding it might have spared me a lot of distress, but\nI am and have always been stubborn and terminally curious\nand so, I returned upstairs, armed with questions for my delirious\nfriend.\n\"Who is he?\" I asked, striding determinedly toward\nCaldwell. \"The dead man in the basement. Who is he?\"\n\"Someone who shouldn't have been here,\" he answered,\n\"even he admitted that much, the fool. 'A mistake' he\nsaid, 'miscalculations led him to the wrong place.' And how\nright he was, but yet he continued to appear, apparently content\nto repeat his mistakes and endanger our time in the process.\"\nI circled his chair and towered over him. \"So you killed\nhim?\"\n\"Spiders die but yet they live as soon as you turn away.\nLet them pretend for as long as they need to. You too know\nthe tricks and will most probably use them. When that happens,\nI will be forced to deal with you too.\"\nControl abandoned me then and I grabbed his shoulders. Visibly\nstartled and outraged, he began to thrash. \"Damn you,\nCaldwell! You know who I am. I'm your friend. I'm Robert.\nRemember me you fool!\"\nHe ceased struggling and a dim light brought a sheen to his\ndark eyes I had not yet noticed. Again, I allowed myself to\nhope and again, I was disappointed.\n\"I know who you are Robert and yet I can't know you.\nYou went away, just like DeFaux.\"\n\"He's the man in the basement?\"\n\"And now you've returned,\" he continued, ignoring\nmy query. \"From where I can't know, from when I haven't\nthe slightest inkling. But I do know this. I guard time now\nand nobody can be allowed to put us in danger. I've seen the\nhorrible, horrible things they have there. I've seen them\nin dreams, in reality and in the space in between. They want\nto destroy themselves and that means destruction for all of\nus.\"\nHe began to tremble and hoisted himself up with a grunt. \"There\nare more of them, Robert. More like you. New strangers, old\nfaces, deception, deceit, violence and evil. It has to be\nstopped.\"\nHe held up the slim black device. \"If they get this back,\nthen all is lost.\"\nI shrugged. \"Then why not destroy it?\"\n\"Because I don't know what that might do! Maybe that's\nwhat I'm supposed to do or maybe the result of such an action\nwould be in line with their plans! Maybe they are trying to\ninfluence me to make such a decision. What should I do when\nany action could destroy us all?\"\nWithout knowing I was going to do it, my arm shot out and\nsnatched the device from his grasp. He screeched and dove\nat me. We tussled and cursed but I held fast and Caldwell\nslumped to the floor, defeated and bleeding but conscious.\nHe moaned in anguish, begged me to return it to but I ignored\nhim.\nMy eyes were fixed on the gray strip at the top of the object.\nA soft blue light flickered beneath my thumb and words magically\nappeared across the strip. My breath caught at the sight of\nmy name: Robert James Hayes.\nMy fascination soon turned to horror as my name vanished and\nwas replaced by the exact date of my birth and what I could\nonly assume was the predicted date of my death. It was four\nmonths away.\nI spun and loomed over the stricken Caldwell, who was sniveling\nand coughing dust. \"What is this? What kind of insane\ntrickery have you designed in your madness, Caldwell?\"\nHe shook his head and wailed. \"Do it then, I have done\nall I can. If you must destroy us then make it quick.\"\nI looked from him to the device, still displaying impossible\ndetails of my life and projected demise. My finger slid down\nto the first button, beneath which was written 'INPUT' in\na strange, barely legible font.\n\"God forgive me,\" Caldwell cried as I pressed the\nbutton.\nThe room filled with pulsating blue light, from the floor\nto the ceiling as the readout on the object displayed the\nnumbers '2291'. I looked up, mouth agape as the drop cloths\non the furniture began to take flight.\n\"Caldwell, what is it? What's happening?\" I said,\nraising my voice to be heard over the cacophony currently\nwhipping itself up in the center of the room.\nWhat appeared to be a transparent blue orb began to take shape\nin the room, mere inches away from where I stood transfixed\nand Caldwell lay pleading.\nWas it possible that my deranged friend had been harboring\na seedling of truth in his ramblings? Could there really exist\nsuch wonders as futuristic voyagers? And if so, why had Caldwell\nbeen driven to eliminate them? Fear? Or foreknowledge?\nThe ethereal blue bubble began to shimmer and inside the shape,\nI fancied I could see the faintest outlines of faces, ill\nformed and pale. And smiling.\nSudden overwhelming terror gripped me and I dropped the device.\nA loud bang deafened me and sent me flying to the ground beside\nCaldwell, who continued to scream obscenities into the ozone-filled\nair.\nThe bubble wobbled and slowly began to shrink into itself,\ntaking the air from the room with it.\nA fierce wind blasted across the room over our heads and for\na moment, we competed against one another in screaming loudest.\nAnd then, silence.\nAfter a moment, I looked up. Caldwell had risen and hurriedly\nretrieved the device. As I watched, he stuffed it into his\npocket and turned to leave the room.\n\"Wait,\" I called after him but he continued on.\nI don't know how long I lay there, looking at the point in\nspace where the impossible had for the briefest of moments\nbeen reality. I wept and cursed and finally took Caldwell's\nchair by the dark fireplace.\nHe was right, I thought with increasing agitation and dismay.\nThe old fool was right. There are visitors and they seek to\nreturn to a time not their own.\nI thought about what that meant but after a while my head\nbegan to throb with the sheer madness of it all.\nIt grew late, darkness rushed to shroud the house and eventually\nI gathered together some old papers from the floor and set\nthem alight. On the backs of some others and by the warmth\nof the fire, I set these words down lest they be my last to\nthe outside world (a world I doubt will mourn me).\nCaldwell, though somewhat portentous in his ramblings is most\ncertainly mad and though I don't wish to question how this\nstate of mind was brought upon him, I realize his appointment\nas keeper of this device is at an end.\nI don't know what it is I plan to do. Perhaps I will take\nhis place or perhaps I will explore the possibilities of this\nmost incredible of discoveries.\nCaldwell, my dear sweet friend, will have to go.\nSuch knowledge in a bruised and wounded brain is dangerous.\nThe\nEnd","source":"http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20051030150806\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/aprjun2003\/theendofmrblame.htm","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/Svlzt3gp5l7WbwE44g9qG0IaTws.json","volume":4.0,"issues":2.0,"has_text":true}

The wildman on the other side remains in the shadows.\nFrom my vantage point, the knight, holding a severed head,\ndoesn't deserve this treatment.\nThe butler's polite cough interrupts\nmy reverie and he leads down a hallway dotted with armor\nand the portraits of the Ravenstock war dead, beginning\nin 1066 and ending in the recent Boer conflict.\nRavenstock puts down the rifle when I\nenter his study and shakes my hand.\nHe notices me looking at the stuffed animal heads decorating\nhis study.\n\"You go in for sport, Mr. Nash?\"\n\"Only the kind that fires back.\"\nIf he gets the insult he doesn't show it.\n\"I specifically requested the agency to send an operative\nwell known for his discretion.\"\n\"You'll get that and more, Baron.\"\n\"Excellent.

Once stationed in Paris.\"\n\"Know where he is?\"\n\"Not a clue.\"\n\"Ok. I\"ll take care of him.\"\nThe butler re-appeared and was escorting\nme out of the grounds when I heard the scream.\nBirds on the roof scattered, a horse kicked a section of\nthe stable wall out, a dog scurried away.\nThe butler didn't bat an eye.\n\"Please leave me your address, Mr. Nash, so that we\nmay pay you.\"\nI suppose, had I thought about it, that fate was trying\nto prepare me for the outcome when the librarian put me\nin Karl Marx's chair at the British library. I too was going\nto be bomb-thrower at the aristocracy.\nThe Ravenstocks were well-documented in Burke's Peerage.\nThe Baron made his name in the Crimean War and then in big-game\nhunting. His oldest son, Jonathan, a diplomat, disappeared\nin Africa 17 years ago. His father found him last year and\nreturned him to England with minimal publicity. His other\nson, Sebastian, died in the Boer war after prolonged maltreatment\nby an Orange militia.\nI got up to leave when I saw another\npatron looking at a blueprint of the Ravenstock estate.\nI tried a hunch.\n\"Mr. Cans?\"\nThe patron turned and smiled slowly.\n\"Let me guess--a Scotland Yard official in the pay\nof the good baron or one of his private police. Let me save\nyou some trouble. I'm not stopping.\"\n\"He won't pay anything.\"\n\"I don't want money,\" he said and got up to leave.\n\"What do you want?\"\n\"Read Wuthering Heights my friend.\"\nThe enigma left.\nCans was a hard man to follow but I managed\nto. He arrived at an East End tenement. I waited and he\nleft 30 minutes later. Whatever he had in there, he wanted\nit safe. It took me 30 minutes to pick all three locks.\nHe didn't need the British library; he\nhad his own mini-library in here. At a desk were three maps--one\nof Africa, one of Paris and the other of London. A red line\nhe drew connected all three. The line ended at the Ravenstock\nestate blueprint. Beside the maps were police reports from\nthree countries:\nApril of last year: Belgian official in Libreville Africa\nfound with his throat ripped out.\nJune, Paris, last year: Woman found dead in alley. Identified\nas Mary Cans.\nCans? His wife?\nFebruary, this year: Man found ripped apart in London docks.\nSkeletons indeed.\nLuckily I had a friend in the war office.\n\"Off the record, Nash. Ok? Ravenstock's son, his youngest,\ndidn't die in the Boer War. The corpse was much older. And\nthe wounds were not from anything human.\"\n\"How did it get there then?\"\n\"Ask the baron. He was there the whole week with the\nother son, the one he got back from Africa.\"\nI went back to ask Cans what he was after. But he'd never\ntell me. He became what he studied. His throat was ripped\nout. Whoever was there had ransacked the library. I was\nabout to leave before the police got there when I saw a\ncopy of Wuthering Heights on the ground.\nRead Wuthering Heights, my friend.\nWhen I read what was inside the packet sown into the cover,\nit all became clear.\nA shaft of light and a monstrous smell greets the Baron\nand the butler as they opened the cellar door.\nI announce my presence by cocking my pistol.\n\"Nash, what in God's name?\"\n\"Can it, Baron.

You're Rochester, so where's the insane\nrelative you stash in here?\"\nA shadow cuts across a beam of light in the center of the\ncellar room. I run forward.

This may\nsound unbelievable; but in fact was merely a coincidence of whatever force of\nnature reared itself up that night.\nYou see, there also perished in the courthouse fire of 1859 a man.\nHis death was never reported or recorded.\nThere is no marker, no memorial to be found in all the county;\ncertainly none anywhere else. Whatever\nrecords, whatever indications of his existence failed to burn to cinders in\nthe courthouse were set ablaze separately: his home, immediately thereafter;\nhis possessions not inside.\nImagine a mob, a rabble: for that\u2019s what they became, the local\ncitizenry. A roiling, angry\nmachine framed by a night awash in torchlight and echoing with calls of savage\njoy.\nLike predators feasting. All\nto eradicate the remnants of a man. Yes,\nthey went so far as to rip out and burn sheets from merchants\u2019 account\nbooks; receipts scrounged from sundry cash boxes; all his correspondence, even\nto the innocuous.\nThe man was, thereby, reduced to legend.\nThe people then drew their collective breath; watched around corners\nand listened diligently for footfalls, for decades.\nTime, like a gentle sandstorm, at last weathered away all those base\nemotions which had erupted that night. Only\nthen were whispers heard from the more foolhardy of the people--but whispers\nonly.\nHe too returned.\nChapter\nOne\nI received an urgent call to come to the public library, the night\nlittle Claire showed up.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s urgent at the library?\u201d Marie, my wife, asked when I hung\nup the phone.\n\u201cDelahousaye wouldn\u2019t say,\u201d I replied.\n\u201cMust be some sort of obscure town business.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like Charlie, all right.\nThe old hen.\u201d She\nchuckled, then her expression evened. \u201cAt\nthis hour of night. I can\u2019t\nbelieve it\u2019s such a matter of life or death that it couldn\u2019t wait till\nmorning.\u201d\nI shrugged, smiling at her. She\ndrew her legs up underneath herself on the sofa, then resumed knitting.\nAs with everything else she did, Marie made a happy diligence of even\nthe simplest of pastimes.\nWhat a handsome woman she is, I thought.\nClassic looks, fine high cheekbones and deep blue eyes.\nI could just look at her skin and feel its softness.\n\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t take too long,\u201d I said hopefully.\nStepping over to the coat rack near the front door, I grabbed my London\nFog and pulled it on.\n\u201cJust please don\u2019t be out too late, Mr. Town Attorney,\u201d she said,\neyebrow cocked skeptically, as I bent to kiss her goodbye.\nDelahousaye had no need of legal advice, although Marie wouldn\u2019t know\nthat from my end of the conversation and I didn\u2019t think I should worry her.\nNo, Charlie needed me there because I\u2019m the local (unofficial)\nhistorian. Something strange was\nup; I could hear it in his voice.\nHow does a small-town lawyer get to be a historian?\nTo begin with, I\u2019m native to the county. My family\u2019s been in the area since the Spanish Crown was\ngiving away land to the tune of tens of thousands of acres a parcel.\nUnfortunately, the Civil War reduced the Pippingers to wage earners.\nBy the time I came along in 1921, the family had managed to acquire\nsome land again--farming paid pretty well in the teens--but the Depression\ntook care of any long-term plans we might\u2019ve had in that regard. I got a job hauling feed sacks at the Burleigh Co-op; Alton\nJohnson, my dad\u2019s best friend, was the manager. That brought in ten cents an hour. Dad, meanwhile, chased construction jobs around the state.\nTogether we kept the bills paid (and almost on time).\nI got to see more of the world than I wanted to, starting in \u201842.\nA good bit of shrapnel, and plenty of luck, and I was home right after\nthey got Hitler; and mostly intact. Well,\nthe limp isn\u2019t pronounced; it sure beats the alternative.\nMr. Johnson kept me a spot at the Co-op, and I was able to go to law\nschool nights on the GI Bill. Things\nwere turning around pretty well for the family by that time, Dad having gotten\nwork at the new paper mill James River started up in \u201844.\nNo more taking in wash for Mom.\nI hung out my shingle in 1950, and the townspeople thought enough of me\nto elect me town attorney two years ago.\nOf course, it takes more than being born here to make you a historian.\nYou have to really love and care about it (which I do).\nBut that\u2019s the extent of my qualifications--oh, I did take a few\ncourses back in college, but the demands of law school and work didn\u2019t leave\nmuch time for fun. Marie and I\nwere married in 1948; so I had to get my law degree as quickly as I could.\nBut once we were settled down, I made a hobby out of poking around in\nthe past.\nNow, with Arpent County you get a lot more than history with your history. Meaning that odd things have always had a way of happening around here. We locals are more or less used to it, but outsiders never truly believe the stories we tell. Too bad. It\u2019s a tourist draw, just the same.\nI closed the front door behind me.\nThe weather had turned nasty late that afternoon, the cold fall drizzle\nseemingly having quenched the sun altogether.\nI drew the coat\u2019s collar up as high as I could, and the wool lining\nwas plenty warm. But I shivered\nanyway. It had to have been\nDelahousaye\u2019s voice--\nStepping down from the porch, I made my way across the slick stepping\nstones to my car. Let myself in\non the passenger side. As usual,\nthe Roadmaster was a little stubborn cranking; but she always coaxes well.\nThe heat had about come up by the time I\u2019d turned from Elm onto\nCommerce. I took one last swipe\nat the foggy windshield before tossing the hand towel aside. Only so much I could do, though; it was past time to replace\nthe wiper blades. My headlights\ntried their best to pierce the hazy mist, while the old street lamps cast\nblurry circles ahead of me on the pavement; it all bothered my eyes.\nNo night to be out.\nShe looked precisely like the waif we assumed she was.\nSomeone had draped a coat over her, which only emphasized that\nimpression. She had big, sad,\ndark brown eyes, with a gleam like tears verging.\nHer head seemed too big for her body, her face was round, her mouth\nsmall with lips drawn and narrow. She\nwas evidently thin. The color of\nher skin was such that you thought she must be shivering under her coat; but\nshe wasn\u2019t. Her paleness, on\ncloser inspection, was natural to her. The\ndarkness of her eyes was matched by the mat of tangled curls that framed her\nface and lightly touched her shoulders.\nCharlie had met me on the library\u2019s portico while I dutifully shook\nthe water off my coat--so as not to track too much inside.\nMiss Perkins likes to scold. But\na smile and a wink usually make her blush and go back to her book chores.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Delahousaye said. \u201cNo\ntime to lose.\u201d\nCharles Delahousaye\u2019s a big man, ruddy-faced, with enough temper to\nkeep the peace more than adequately in a town Burleigh\u2019s size.\nHe\u2019d come from Atlanta a dozen years ago. Yes, an outsider. But\nwhen you\u2019re faced with the collapse of a local scheme involving the current\npolice chief--old family, old ways (tradition, you know)--you can\u2019t help but\nlook across the fence. So they\ndid, gathered in a few impressive and many not-so-impressive resumes, and\nDelahousaye resulted. He\u2019d been\nnothing but good for the town--although I never let him believe it.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the rush, Charlie?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something about this kid.\u201d\nI shrugged because I didn\u2019t understand what he was talking about.\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you call me\nanyway?\u201d I said, stepping inside ahead of him, hoping against hope that it was\nlegal business.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d he said. \u201cCome\non.\u201d\nShe had neither smiled nor frowned when I approached.\nI tried a smile of my own. She\nwas unmoved, so I let it go.\nThey\u2019d sat her on one of the dark old pine benches that have been\nfixtures in our library since its construction in the early 1800s.\nThe building itself is a limestone marvel.\nUnique architecturally, it\u2019s been the subject of countless newspaper\nand magazine pieces.\n--\nBecause the thing\u2019s a decagon. Why?\nNo one knows. There are, after all, several octagonal buildings in\nthe country; who could complain about eight sides?\nSo, should we blame the architects or the ones who commissioned them?\nIf the latter, we\u2019re put squarely into the midst of public policy and\nexpenditure. The answer clearly ought to be known. In the end, though, all we have is speculation.\nWhich, in my opinion, is all we should have on the subject.\nThey did make an addition to the library in the early 1900s, a\nrectangle attached to the back, which despite grumbling even to this day was\nnot a bad effort--and the space was needed.\nThe architectural firm of Kilhaus and Weiner even went so far as to\nmatch the limestone by removing a section and lugging it to quarries.\nNot that that has kept most observers from denouncing the work as\nrubbing tradition the wrong way. (Traditions\nare wonderful, thick-hided but slow-moving targets.\nIt does take a lot to bring one down.)\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I asked her.\n\u201cClaire,\u201d she said. Her\nvoice was small, as I expected, but it had a distinct undertone of\nmaturity--something I\u2019d almost call vast age.\nI wanted to shiver again, but controlled myself.\n\u201cClaire what?\u201d\nShe said nothing, looking at me with those large eyes, her lips\nslightly parted; finally she shook her head slowly.\nDid she not know? Or was\nshe unwilling to say?\n\u201cSame as before,\u201d Delahousaye said.\n\u201cWe asked her.\u201d\n\u201cHow long she been here?\u201d\n\u201cShowed up about an hour ago. Just\nwalked in, and asked Miss Perkins about things.\u201d\n\u201cThings? What things? What\u2019s that mean?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, exactly.\u201d\n\u201cIs that what she said? That\nshe wanted to know about things?\u201d\n\u201cNo. According to Miss\nPerkins, she stepped up to the desk, pulled out her list, and said, \u2018I must\nfind my things.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cList?\u201d\nDelahousaye nodded, then turned to Claire.\n\u201cWould you show Mr. Pippinger here your list?\u201d\nWithout hesitation, Claire thrust a hand inside the coat, withdrawing a\nfolded, well-worn piece of paper. Meticulously\nshe unfolded it, then smoothed it on the bench beside her.\nThe page was a regular eight and a half by eleven sheet of notebook\npaper--the kind every schoolgirl uses. She\nheld it out to me, but I noticed she kept a tight grip on it; she had no\nintention of surrendering her \u201clist.\u201d\nThe printing was quite juvenile; although I estimated Claire to be ten\nor eleven, the lettering was the overlarge, carefully rendered hand of a child\nmore on the order of eight.\nIt was quite an eclectic list.\nMorse Abbey\nShani\ndark\u2019ning day\ncyclone\nGammon\nablaze\nA couple of the items caught my eye.\nI let Claire withdraw the sheet, then squatted down to face her.\n\u201cClaire, where are your parents?\u201d\nAgain she said nothing, shaking her head.\nI looked up at Delahousaye. \u201cYour\nmen are running a check, I presume?\u201d\n\u201cPut \u2018em on it an hour ago. But\nwhat do you make of that list she has?\u201d\nI stood and shrugged. \u201cRandom\nwords.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Morse Abbey?\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cYes, I know,\nI saw that. Clearly something to\ndo with the area. But past\nthat....\u201d I shrugged again; I didn\u2019t see a need to mention anything\nabout the other item I\u2019d recognized. \u201cIs\nthat why you called me here?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only clue we\u2019ve got; who\u2019s a more likely candidate to\nfigure it out? You know, Tom, she\nisn\u2019t like your ordinary lost child. I\ncould tell that when I first saw her. She\ndoesn\u2019t know--or won\u2019t admit--her last name.\nSo, logically, I think runaway. But\nshe doesn\u2019t say so. I don\u2019t\nsee any obvious bruises, like she\u2019s been beaten or anything.\u201d\n\u201cYou should have Dr. Bernard look at her anyway.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d planned on it. And\nI\u2019ve got to find somebody who\u2019ll put her up for a night--maybe several.\u201d\nHe paused, looking at me as if expecting an offer.\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask me to ask Marie, Charlie.\u201d\nHe took my elbow, guiding me away so Claire couldn\u2019t overhear. \u201cCome on, Tom. We\nneed to involve as few people in this as possible.\nYou know that.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. She\u2019s\njust a little lost girl. Good\nGod, Charlie, you act like you\u2019ve seen a spook or something.\u201d\n\u201cJust ask Marie, Tom. What\u2019s\nthe harm in it?\u201d\nMy voice rose. \u201cThe harm\nis that I love her, and she doesn\u2019t need to be hurt any more than she\nalready has been.\u201d\n\u201cBut how could it hurt?--\u201d\nI glared at Delahousaye hard enough to make him back off. He raised his hands, palms toward me. \u201cAll right, Tom. All\nright.\u201d\nA few seconds later, I felt the emotion subside, drew a deep breath and\nlet it out. \u201cSorry, Charlie.\nThere wasn\u2019t any call for that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Tom. I\nunderstand. I\u2019ll just switch to\nPlan B.\u201d\n\u201cWhich is?--\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m working on that right now.\u201d\nI chuckled, then shook my head. \u201cWhat\nabout the Allens?\u201d\n\u201cI thought of them. But\nthey just went out of town this morning; visiting her mom.\u201d\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s plenty of other choices.\u201d\n\u201cTom, every other family I\u2019ve thought of putting Claire with poses\nan obvious problem--namely, young kids.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a problem?\u201d\n\u201cYes. I just don\u2019t\nthink she should be put in that sort of environment.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nCharlie opened his mouth to answer, then nudged my elbow again while\nhitching his head toward the library entrance.\nOnce we\nwere on the portico, he spoke again. \u201cI\u2019m\nresponsible for public safety in Burleigh.\nI don\u2019t think putting Claire in with other kids--in that kind of\nfamily environment--is upholding my duty.\u201d\nHe paused. \u201cI know it\nsounds strange, but I\u2019ve got to trust my gut instinct.\nThe Allens are childless; so are you and Marie.\u201d\nI was silent for a stretch. Damn\nCharlie Delahousaye\u2019s perceptiveness. Yes,\nthere was something very unsettling about Claire. It all had to do with the list.\nThe fact that she apparently came from nowhere--all right, that could\nbe explained a hundred ways. But\nhow could she know anything about Arpent County, unless she\u2019d been here?\nAnd even if she had, how could she know?--\nCharlie was right to be concerned.\nMy jaw muscle worked for awhile. Damn\nit all. \u201cOkay, Charlie.\nJust let me get a head start. I\u2019ll\nneed to prepare Marie for our...guest.\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cThanks, Tom.\nYou don\u2019t know how much this means to me.\u201d\n\u201cSure, I do. It means\nyou owe me one--a big one.\u201d\n\u201cDeal. How\u2019s about a\nweek of fishing at Lake Bear?\u201d\n\u201cDone.\u201d\nI turned to go.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Charlie said, \u201cone more thing.\nDon\u2019t tell anybody about Claire\u2019s list.\u201d\nI stopped and looked back at Charlie, eyebrow cocked.\n\u201cShe really did spook you, didn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\u201cFirst rule of law enforcement--when you don\u2019t ever get scared\nanymore, it\u2019s time to hang \u2018em up.\u201d\nHe opened the library door. \u201cSee\nyou in about twenty minutes.\u201d\nI drew up my coat collar as I descended the library steps.\nAt which point I went ahead and let myself have a good case of the\nshakes.\n\u201cWow, that didn\u2019t take long,\u201d Marie said, smiling, as I\nwalked in the front door.\n\u201cSee, I told you so.\u201d I\npeeled off my coat, hung it up, then stepped over to the couch, sat, and took\nher hands. Her eyes widened; she\nknew something was up. \u201cSweetheart,\nCharlie\u2019s asked us to do him a big favor.\u201d\n\u201cOh? What?\u201d\n\u201cThe reason he called me over to the library, is that there\u2019s a\nlittle girl who showed up there this evening.\nShe\u2019s apparently lost, even though she won\u2019t admit it. Charlie needs a place to put her up until they can find her\nparents. I hadn\u2019t wanted\nto--there\u2019s lots of other families in town--\u201d\n\u201cBut why not?\u201d Her\nexpression was exactly as I\u2019d pictured it when Charlie first asked.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got plenty of room here.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cBut\nthat\u2019s not the point. I told\nCharlie I think she\u2019d be better off with other kids around.\u201d\nMarie\u2019s brow furrowed for a second, then she nodded.\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re right. But\nit really won\u2019t be any bother, having her stay here. And I\u2019m sure I\u2019d like--\u201d\n\u201cI know. It\u2019s just\nthat I didn\u2019t want you to feel....\u201d\nShe squeezed my hand. \u201cIt\u2019s\nbeen over two years now. Yes, I\nthink about it often; and it hurts, oh God, it hurts like it was yesterday. But Tom, Darling, I\u2019m not going to let it hurt forever.\nI can\u2019t.\u201d\nI smiled at her, but only half-heartedly.\nThe memories were just too insistent.\nAll the years of trying; all the anguish with each failure.\nThen, at last, Marie got pregnant--what a wonderful, joyous thing.\nHer term was a rough one, she\u2019d had to rest for most of it, but Tommy\nwas a beautiful little boy; so beautiful.\nThen the polio--\nThen, when Dr. Bernard told Marie she couldn\u2019t bear another child, I\nwas sure I\u2019d lost her for good, in that dark place inside herself she fled\nto. But gradually she returned,\nall on her own; I never quite understood how she did it.\n\u201cI\u2019d better get busy,\u201d Marie said, standing and going to the hall\ncloset for linens. \u201cGot to\nchange the sheets; the ones on the bed are musty by now.\nWould you help me move my sewing machine back into the corner?\nOh, and I\u2019d better do some general straightening up.\u201d\nI chuckled. \u201cCharlie\u2019ll\nbe here soon. You\u2019re not going\nto repaint the room, are you?\u201d\n\u201cYou never mind,\u201d she said sarcastically.\n\u201cGo watch Sid Caesar. I\u2019ll\ntell you when I need your back.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d I said, heading for the easy chair.\n\u201cBy the way, Darling, what\u2019s her name?\u201d\n\u201cClaire.\u201d\n\u201cClaire? What a\nbeautiful name.\u201d\nImogene Coca had just pulled a great one on Sid Caesar when the\ndoorbell rang. It was awkward\ngetting the easy chair back up straight while I was laughing, but I managed\nit, got the set turned off and made my way to the door.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get it, sweetheart,\u201d I called to Marie.\nIt was Delahousaye, come to drop off Claire.\n\u201cClaire,\u201d Charlie said, \u201cthis is Mr. Pippinger.\nYou remember him from the library awhile ago.\u201d\nShe nodded shyly.\n\u201cHello again, Claire,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be staying with us until we can find your parents.\u201d\nHer expression was just as dull as it had been earlier--not vacant like\nshe didn\u2019t understand what was being said; maybe ambivalent\u2019s the right\nword. Then, without warning, she\nbroke into a smile.\n\u201cMarie,\u201d the chief called over my shoulder.\n\u201cHello. This is\nClaire.\u201d\nI turned. Marie had come\ninto the room. Claire had spotted\nher, and now she was smiling just like a normal ten-year-old.\nNext thing you know, Marie had taken her by the hand, they\u2019d greeted\neach other as if they\u2019d been friends their whole life, and they went off\ntoward Tommy\u2019s room.\n\u201cHow do you like that?\u201d I said to him, staring after them.\n\u201cA heck of a lot, Tom,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt looks like y\u2019all are going to get along just fine.\u201d\nThat bothered me. \u201cAny\nword yet on the search?\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Fraid not. We\u2019ve\ngot every local agency in the state working on it now; the state police should\nhave their own bulletins out to our neighbors by morning.\nDon\u2019t worry, Tom; something\u2019ll turn up.\u201d\nI drew a deep breath, looking Police Chief Charlie Delahousaye straight\nin the eye. \u201cDon\u2019t be too\nsure, Charlie.\u201d\nMuch later, Marie came into our bedroom on tiptoes.\nI had lain awake, turning the puzzle over in my head.\nWhere to start? If only I\nknew Claire\u2019s last name. Then\nthere was the list. How could a\nten-year-old girl know about an abbey that had been abandoned before Burleigh\nwas even established? She had to\nhave gotten the list from someone else. But\nwhom?\nOf course, that wasn\u2019t the worst of it.\nWhen I saw the name Gammon, it was as if someone had plunged a cold\nknife through me. I know I\npaled--thank God Delahousaye didn\u2019t notice.\n\u201cShe okay?\u201d I whispered.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Marie said, a little start in her voice.\n\u201cTom, Darling, I didn\u2019t know you were still awake.\u201d\n\u201cJust thinking about Claire. Did\nshe say any more?\u201d\nMarie sat down on the bed. \u201cOnly\nthat she felt safe here. Tom, she\ngave me a big hug when I tucked her in. No,\nshe didn\u2019t say anything about her parents, and I didn\u2019t ask. There\u2019s plenty of time for that tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to find out where she came from, Marie.\u201d\nShe put a finger to my lips. \u201cTomorrow.\u201d\nSeconds later, she\u2019d undressed and climbed in next to me, without\nbothering to put on a nightgown. The\nwarmth of her skin, the lingering scent of her perfume, made my heart race. She rubbed her hand against my chest. I cupped her face, and kissed her softly.\n\u201cI love you, Marie. Thank\nyou for helping out with this; it was a lot to ask.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cthank you.\nThis is something I needed--very very much--and didn\u2019t even know\nit.\u201d\nOur lovemaking was more eager than it had been in years. There was even a quality of joy in it--something I\u2019d\nthought had gone from our life.\nAll because of a little lost girl who\u2019d come out of nowhere.\nMaybe literally.\nAnd I had to send her back.\nMy God.\nChapter\nTwo\nMy concentration was poor at work next morning.\nLuckily, the only pressing matters I had to take care of were a couple\nof fairly simple town contracts, and a pleading on behalf of one of my\nprivate-practice clients. This\nlast was a straightforward property dispute, two neighbors who had the great\ngood fortune (misfortune?) of having one of the clear, sandy creeks of the\narea run right between them. So\nit did. Higher when the rains\ncame, lower in between. As you\nmight imagine, a swollen creek tends to follow the path of least resistance,\nwhich means that in terms of land sometimes it giveth, and sometimes it taketh\naway. Pete Chapel got a little\ntired of being on the losing end of geological forces after roughly ten years\nof it, and I guess when you coupled that with the fact that he ran into a\nlosing streak at poker with Harry Finch, my client, his erstwhile friend,\nlitigation was bound to result. I\nknow Pete almost as well as I do Harry. I\ntried my best to explain to Pete the law as it pertains to meandered streams. Harry went so far as to offer Pete a nominal amount of\nmoney--which he didn\u2019t have to do--to settle the dispute.\nAnd maybe that was the big mistake, in the end; Pete probably thought\nof it as Harry offering him money he\u2019d beaten out of him at the card table.\nHurt his pride.\nOh, well. Pete\u2019s going\nto lose, there\u2019s no two ways about it.\nI finished the pleading in a little over an hour.\nGrabbing up the papers and my briefcase, I headed for the door.\n\u201cHere you go, Annie,\u201d I said.\n\u201cRetype this pleading--I made some corrections--and go ahead and send\nthese contracts over to May at the town hall; I\u2019ve signed them.\nI\u2019m off to the library.\u201d\nShe took a pencil and scratched a note on her desk calendar. \u201cBe back when?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cNot sure. Maybe not at\nall; it\u2019s fairly quiet here. I\u2019ll\nphone later to see if anything exciting\u2019s come up.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Any message for\nMarie if she calls?\u201d\nI smiled. \u201cJust tell her\nI love her.\u201d\nI figured I\u2019d start with what we knew, meaning Miss Perkins.\nOur head librarian is quite a woman.\nIf something as peaceful as a library can be run like an army camp,\nthen she\u2019s the quintessential commander--the lady takes her work very\nseriously. When I was a kid, she\nwas under Miss Baker. That meant\nshe did the grunt work: most of the re-shelfing, straightening out the card\nfile, and shushing troublemakers--once, when I was a teenager, she actually\nthrew us out of the place. Yep,\njust like an MP. Finally Miss\nBaker retired, Miss Perkins took over, and a young woman came in to take her\nplace. It was the cycle repeating\nitself; very traditional. I hope\nit lasts.\nThe morning had broken clear and bright, following the rain of last\nevening. Fall had finally\nasserted itself. The library,\nwhich sits perched atop a little rise at the head of Commerce Street, seemed\nsomehow taller this morning. Summers\nhere are muggy, and toward September become quite oppressive.\nWhen the change of season at last pushes all the humidity and haze out\nto the Gulf, it\u2019s almost as if the buildings are able to stretch themselves\nback up to their true heights.\nPulling into one of the parking spots at streetside, I let myself out,\nclimbed the steps, and went on in.\n\u201cGood morning, Miss Perkins,\u201d I said as I stepped up to the main\ndesk. She gave me that knowing\nsmile like she always does (recalling my shenanigans of years gone by, no\ndoubt).\n\u201cMorning, Mr. Pippinger.\u201d\n\u201cNow come on, Miss Perkins. It\nwas Tom up till a couple of years ago.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Tommy not so long before that.\u201d\nShe drew herself up. \u201cYou\u2019re\nthe town attorney now, Mr. Pippinger. It\u2019s\nproper.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d I said, waving my hand.\n\u201cI\u2019m through trying.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re here to ask about that little girl, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Ma\u2019am,\u201d I said. \u201cI\nneed to know exactly when you first saw her, what she did, what she said.\u201d\nShe nodded. There was a\nlittle sparkle in her blue eyes, which are very attractive; every so often I\nembarrass her about them. \u201cPeculiar\nlittle girl. I first saw her at\nsix forty-one--I remember looking up at the clock right when she came\ninside.\u201d\n\u201cI assume she came in the front way.\nDid you actually see her step through the door?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I heard the door closing--you know that sound as well as\nanyone--and I looked up, just like always.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t see anyone outside.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cDid you notice anything else outside, like a vehicle backing out or\npulling away?\u201d\n\u201cNo, there was no traffic just then.\nI\u2019d have seen it.\u201d\n\u201cChief Delahousaye said she walked up to the desk here and said, \u2018I\nmust find my things.\u2019 Is that\nright?\u201d\n\u201cYes, those were her exact words.\u201d\n\u201cDid you ask her what things?\u201d\n\u201cNot right away. I asked\nwhere her parents were, naturally. She\nseemed so...lost.\u201d\n\u201cAnd she didn\u2019t answer.\u201d\n\u201cJust shook her head; it was like she had no idea what I was talking\nabout. That\u2019s when I asked her\nwhat things she was missing.\u201d\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\u201cShe pulled out that folded piece of paper she had. Did you see it?\nYou did? Then you know it\nwas just some words someone had written down.\nThat\u2019s when I called Chief Delahousaye.\u201d\n\u201cAnd here we are.\u201d\n\u201cThere is one thing, of course.\nBut I\u2019m sure you\u2019re already aware of it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cHer clothing. Didn\u2019t\nyou notice her clothing?\u201d\nThat stopped me short. \u201cNo,\nI didn\u2019t--no, wait, I couldn\u2019t; they were covered up.\nSomeone had thrown a coat over her.\nWhen the chief brought her by last night, Marie took her straight to\nthe bathtub and then bed. I never\nsaw the clothes.\u201d\nMiss Perkins raised an eyebrow. \u201cWell,\nMr. Town Historian, little Claire was dressed in perfect style for a youngster\nof the eighteen hundreds--I\u2019d guess mid-eighteen hundreds.\u201d\nMy eyes widened. \u201cMarie\ndidn\u2019t say a word about that--except she needed to buy her some things\ntoday. But that was only natural.\u201d\n\u201cTake a close look when you get home.\nWho knows, maybe it was a costume.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cSure.\nThat\u2019d make sense.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, if it was me I\u2019d bring those things to show Kathryn,\nover at the shop. She knows\nantique linens better than anyone in the state.\u201d\n\u201cAntique?\u201d I said; then my mouth hung open for a little while\nbefore I remembered myself, thanked Miss Perkins, and left.\nI stopped off at the town hall, which was on my way back home.\n\u201cOkay, Chief,\u201d I said to Delahousaye as I stepped inside his office\nand sat in the visitor\u2019s chair, \u201ctell me the good news.\nSomebody either here or the next state over\u2019s missing a little girl;\nshe\u2019s about ten years old; dark hair and eyes; yay tall.\u201d\nI held my hand up about as high as Claire is.\n\u201cSorry, Tom. There\u2019s\nnothing come in yet. One report\nof a missing girl two states over. But\nshe\u2019s fifteen, with blond hair, a Marilyn Monroe complex, and has been\nthreatening to run away to California for weeks.\nThey\u2019ll catch up with her, oh, I\u2019d guess along about New Mexico\nway.\u201d\n\u201cI was afraid you\u2019d say something like that.\nTell me, Charlie, last night when you got to the library, did you see\nwhat Claire had on?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, just a coat. I\nmean, somebody had put one over her clothes.\nShe\u2019d come in out of the rain, you know; must\u2019ve been freezing.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cMiss Perkins,\nover at the library, said Claire had on an outfit straight out of the last\ncentury.\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon.\u201d\n\u201cUm hm. Something like\nthey wore a hundred years ago, according to her estimate.\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n\u201cGranted. But them\u2019s\nthe facts.\u201d\n\u201cMust\u2019ve been some sort of costume.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Miss Perkins said.\u201d\n\u201cYou say that like you don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cI haven\u2019t\nlooked at them yet. Last night,\nMarie grabbed the kid and they ran off together to Tommy\u2019s room--you were\nthere, you saw--and that was the last I saw of Claire.\nMarie was being a mommie.\u201d\nCharlie\u2019s eyes widened.\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d I said.\nHe sat forward, put his arms on the desk, and wove his fingers\ntogether. \u201cTom, I\u2019m really\nsorry. I hadn\u2019t even considered\nthat possibility.\u201d\nI drew a deep breath and exhaled.\n\u201cYou know, Charlie, I hadn\u2019t either.\nI was all set to deal with the old wound--with the grief, the\nanger--all over again; I think that would\u2019ve been a lot easier.\u201d\nI stood to go. \u201cSee you\nlater.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll phone you with an update this afternoon; or sooner, if I hear\nsomething promising.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, Charlie. I\u2019m\nheaded home now, then over to Kate\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cKate\u2019s?\u201d he said, genuine surprise in his voice.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s necessary--if only to rule out a possibility.\u201d\nDelahousaye rocked back in his chair, with a look on his face\nlike--well, he obviously thought I was crazy.\nI hasten to add, I agreed with him.\nWhen I got home, no one was there.\nI\u2019d pulled the Buick up to the edge of the carport, reminding myself\nto clear the thing out--my boat and associated paraphernalia have pretty much\ntaken over.\n\u201cMarie,\u201d I called as I went inside; but that was just force of\nhabit--I knew good and darn well she\u2019d never get done shopping for Claire in\nless than five hours.\nI made straight for Tommy\u2019s room.\nSure enough, there was Claire\u2019s dress, draped over the back of the\ndesk chair; her shoes sat on the floor nearby.\n\u201cMarie borrowed something for her to wear shopping,\u201d I said to no\none. Probably from the Clements,\nI guessed; little Teresa was just about Claire\u2019s size.\nLifting the dress carefully, I studied it front and back. Miss Perkins was right.\nI\u2019d seen enough historical documents, enough paintings and\ndrawings--even a few antique pieces in Kate\u2019s shop--to know.\nStrangely enough, the dress was bone dry.\nAnd I knew I hadn\u2019t heard the automatic dryer running last night.\nIn the pocket was Claire\u2019s list.\nShe\u2019d apparently left it there for safe-keeping.\nTucking it in my breast pocket, I threw the dress over my arm, picked\nup the shoes and headed back out to the car.\nKathryn Vale\u2019s antique shop is located right in the middle of\nBurleigh\u2019s historic district. It\nhad been a movie theater once--The Grand.\nIn fact, the building had been erected with great ceremony along about\nthe beginning of the motion picture industry itself.\nSomehow the venture failed, though--my guess has always been that in\nArpent County you can\u2019t overtake real life with make-believe--and the\nbuilding sat vacant until Kate came along.\nUsing her late husband\u2019s life insurance money, she renovated the\nplace, dividing it into two shops. One\nshe used for her business, the other she rented out.\nWe had our doubts about the whole thing at the time, but she\u2019s turned\nout to be a real smart businesswoman.\nI found her behind the counter, eating her lunch and reading a book.\n\u201cGood afternoon, Tom,\u201d she said, looking up.\n\u201cHow\u2019s Marie?\u201d\n\u201cAfternoon, Kate. She\u2019s\njust fine, thanks.\u201d\nI set the clothing in front of her on the counter.\n\u201cWhat have we here?\u201d she said.\n\u201cYou tell me.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, come on,\u201d she said, putting her sandwich aside and wiping\nher hands thoroughly with a napkin. She\ngathered up the pieces and headed to her workroom.\nThere she sat down, snapped on her work light and adjusted the\nmagnifying viewer, then studied the dress at length.\n\u201cVery fine workmanship,\u201d she said.\n\u201cLook here--see the stitching? And\nthe fabric is high-quality cotton, woven on a handloom, dyed with indigo no\ndoubt.\u201d\nNow she moved the magnifier, swiveled the light and held the dress up\nclose so the illumination could pour through it; moved it around until she\u2019d\nexamined the whole thing that way; then set it back on the table, running her\nhands across the fabric. \u201cAnd\nthe buttons are mother-of-pearl. Very\nfine piece.\u201d She looked up at\nme. \u201cNot to mention the shoes,\nwhich I need to inspect more closely. But\none thing at a time. Do you have\na figure in mind?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, a little surprised.\n\u201cOh, no, no, Kate, I\u2019m not here to peddle this stuff.\u201d\nShe smiled and winked. \u201cI\nunderstand. Then I\u2019ll make you\nan offer. For the dress, three\nhundred; I need to look at the shoes again, but I know I\u2019ll pay at least a\nhundred for them.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Kate, I\u2019m serious. I\njust need to know what you think about them.\nSo they\u2019re authentic?\u201d\n\u201cOf course. I was thrown\noff a little at first, but yes, they\u2019re the real McCoy.\u201d\n\u201cThrown off? What\u2019s\nthat mean?\u201d\n\u201cTom, take a close look at this dress.\u201d\nI leaned forward, squinted a little, then drew back.\n\u201cOkay, what?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where you got these--you don\u2019t have to tell me, of\ncourse--but whoever had them must have kept them under glass for the past\nhundred years.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d\n\u201cHere, let me show you.\u201d She\nstood, stepped through the curtain separating her workroom from the shop\nproper, and seconds\nlater\nreappeared carrying an old, full-length ball gown.\n\u201cThis is the finest piece I\u2019ve got in the shop right now.\nIn fact, it\u2019s about the second-finest I\u2019ve handled in the fifteen\nyears since I opened this shop. Here,\ntake a close look at the fabric. Look\nat the buttons. Here, put your\nhand on it, feel it. Now look at\nthis piece you brought in. See\nthe difference?\u201d\nI did as she said, and sure enough, I could tell. \u201cKate, I see what you mean.\u201d\n\u201cThis little girl\u2019s dress is a museum piece, Tom--I\u2019m dead\nserious about that.\u201d\nI sat back and whistled. \u201cWell,\nKate, I don\u2019t know for sure, but I don\u2019t think this came from any museum.\nCould it be a fake?\u201d\n\u201cVery unlikely. But\nI\u2019m not infallible, Tom. If you\nwant to be absolutely sure, you could cut off a little piece of the fabric and\ntake it down to St. Cloud. There\u2019s\na laboratory there. I\u2019ve had\nthem do chemical tests before, on dyes and such.\nSee this color? If the\ndress is authentic, it\u2019s an indigo dye.\nThey don\u2019t use the real thing anymore.\nThe chemists can tell you.\u201d\nI nodded, still trying to grasp the implications.\nI hadn\u2019t told Kate about Claire.\nNow a bizarre image assaulted my mind: a young girl stepping from one\ncentury straight into another, as if through some kind of doorway.\nImpossible? Maybe.\nBut maybe not. By the time\nI was twenty, I\u2019d heard enough stories about Arpent County to think that,\neven if they weren\u2019t true, enough people believed in them, heart and soul,\nthat it wasn\u2019t worth arguing over. Local\nlegends, you know. But then, when\nI came back from the war, the Five-Eighteen disappeared one evening.\nThat was the same train that had brought me home, mere weeks earlier.\nThere just isn\u2019t any debating whether or not an entire train vanishes\ninto nothingness.\nI\u2019d stopped at Pete\u2019s Esso Station to fill the car. Ernie and I were chatting while he cleaned the windshield.\n\u201cTwenty-eight cents a gallon,\u201d I said, fishing the bills out of my\nwallet. \u201cI can remember when it\nwas a dime.\u201d\nHe chuckled. \u201cYou\nshoulda driven a horse and wagon, like I did when I was a kid.\nHah! I don\u2019t care if\nit\u2019s a dollar a gallon; I ain\u2019t goin\u2019 back.\u201d\n\u201cA dollar?\u201d I said. \u201cErnie,\nthat\u2019ll never happen.\u201d\nHe winked. \u201cThey say\nthat about somethin\u2019 every day of every year.\nThey\u2019re always wrong.\u201d\nI was about to argue the point when I heard a horn honk behind me.\nLooking around, I saw it was Delahousaye pulling in.\nHe rolled his window down.\n\u201cI\u2019m headed down to St. Cloud to look over some arrest records and\nevidence,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried\ncalling you before I left--your home and office both--no luck.\u201d\n\u201cAnd?\u201d I said.\n\u201cStill no luck. Sorry. Just wanted to let you know before I skipped town.\u201d\n\u201cI appreciate it, Charlie.\u201d\n\u201cSomething may come in later, who knows.\u201d\n\u201cSure. Meanwhile, I plan\nto talk to Claire again when I see her. She\nmay be ready to tell us something.\u201d\n\u201cAll right if I come by this evening?\nIf she talks, I\u2019d rather not discuss it over the phone.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Make it after\nnine.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect I\u2019ll make it back till then anyway.\u201d\nAs I neared the house (for the last time today, I hoped) I spotted them\nup ahead, getting out of Laura Clements\u2019 Nash.\nMarie had a string-tied stack of boxes in one hand, and Claire\u2019s hand\nin the other. Laura pulled away\njust as I turned into the drive.\nWhen I got out of the car, there they were near the front steps waiting\nfor me; I\u2019d have felt like a genuine family man, if the eerie feeling\nhadn\u2019t been stronger.\n\u201cSo what do you think?\u201d Marie asked.\nClaire looked just like any other ten-year-old girl.\nMarie had bought her a pretty gingham dress, with a narrow, black\npatent-leather belt and shoes to match. A\npair of white socks completed the outfit. They\u2019d also stopped off at Hannah\u2019s Beauty Salon;\nClaire\u2019s hair had been washed, dried, teased, and sprayed into place (Marie\nhad hers done at the same time; they were quite a pair).\n\u201cY\u2019all did just great,\u201d I told them, leaning over the boxes to\nkiss Marie\u2019s cheek while slipping an arm underneath the stack.\n\u201cThank you, Darling,\u201d she said, letting me have the boxes and\ntaking Claire up the steps.\nI set the boxes on the couch. Marie\ntold Claire to go to Tommy\u2019s room, then continued on to the kitchen.\nI followed her.\n\u201cPot roast,\u201d she commented, tieing her apron and then opening the\noven door.\n\u201cSmells wonderful,\u201d I said, leaning against the kitchen table and\ncrossing my arms while she satisfied herself that things were in order.\nAt which point Claire screamed.\nWe were shocked briefly, then I tore into the hallway with Marie fast\non my heels; moments later, I\u2019d stopped dead still in the doorway. Marie pushed past, rushing to Claire and dropping to her\nknees in front of her. \u201cWhat is\nit, Sweetheart?\u201d Marie said, gripping her shoulders.\n\u201cM-my dress,\u201d Claire stammered.\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone.\u201d She\nnodded toward the empty chair.\n\u201cWait!\u201d I said, an immense feeling of relief washing over me,\n\u201cit\u2019s okay, Honey. Just wait\nright here.\u201d\nHurrying back out to the car, I retrieved the dress and shoes, then\nreturned inside.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Claire,\u201d I said, handing them over.\n\u201cI had to take them to show to a nice lady, earlier today; I just\nforgot to bring them in awhile ago.\u201d\nShe\u2019d grabbed at the dress half-wildly, and was now digging in the\npocket. \u201cMy things!\u201d she\nchoked, her voice tinged with panic. Tears\nwere flowing freely.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay,\u201d I said, reaching in my own pocket to produce the\nfolded piece of paper. \u201cHere,\nClaire; here.\u201d She snatched it\nfrom me. \u201cThis is all that was\nin your pocket. I took it out so\nit wouldn\u2019t get lost.\u201d\n\u201cMy things,\u201d she sniffed. She\nheld the paper tight against her chest, and actually managed a weak smile.\nWhat she said puzzled me; I let an eyebrow arch, but kept quiet.\nMarie, meanwhile, had lifted the corner of her apron and rubbed it\nacross Claire\u2019s cheeks, drying the tears.\n\u201cOkay now, Sweetheart?\u201d\nClaire nodded.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to peel potatoes,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI could use some help.\u201d\nThen they were off together. I\ndrew a deep breath, told my heart it was okay to stop pounding, then went into\nthe living room to see how Perry Mason was doing.\nDinner went smoothly. Claire\nanswered some perfunctory questions--nothing probing--enough so that I thought\nshe must be finally getting used to her surroundings.\n\u201cBy the way, Claire,\u201d I said, summoning my courage, \u201cin the\nbedroom earlier you said you\u2019d lost your things.\nYou meant your list, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, as she looked up; then just as quickly she lowered\nher eyes again. \u201cI mean yes. I meant to say list. I\u2019m\nsorry. I was just scared.\u201d\nI nodded, and continued eating. But\nMarie\u2019s face had become stern, which was her way of saying she didn\u2019t want\nme asking Claire any more hard questions.\nToo bad. I had to have\nanswers, and I had to have them quickly, for Marie\u2019s sake as well as\neveryone else\u2019s--she was already becoming dangerously attached to Claire.\nSo I decided to blunder on ahead--except the phone rang.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d I said, dropping my napkin on the table and\nstanding.\nIt was Jeff Raymond, one of Delahousaye\u2019s officers.\nThe instant I picked up the receiver, I knew something was badly wrong.\nJeff spoke quickly, the words running together, he repeated himself in\nthat hapless way we have when our emotions are rampant; and there was fear in\nhis voice--I knew Jeff, and it shocked me.\n\u201cWhere, Jeff?\u201d I interrupted; then I listened again.\n\u201cAll right. I\u2019m going\ndown there.\u201d By the time I hung\nup, I was shaking like a leaf.\n\u201cTom, what is it?\u201d Marie called from the dining room.\nI stepped back in the doorway.\nHer eyes saucered when she saw me.\n\u201cDarling, you\u2019re white as a sheet.\u201d\n\u201cMarie, Charlie Delahousaye\u2019s been in an accident.\nHe\u2019s at Mercy Hospital, in St. Cloud.\u201d\n\u201cDear God,\u201d Marie said. \u201cIs\nhe all right?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s alive. That\u2019s\nall Jeff could tell me.\u201d I\npaused, still thoroughly shaken, and ran a hand through my hair.\n\u201cHoney, I\u2019ve got to go there.\u201d\nChapter\nThree\nThe two-hour drive to Our Lady of Mercy Hospital in St. Cloud has to\nrate as the longest trip of my life.\nThe call from Jeff had been so unexpected, so shocking, that even as I\nneared the outskirts of the city I\u2019d not yet convinced myself it was all\nreal. The thought of losing a\ngood friend--in fact, Charlie\u2019s just about my best friend in the world, not\ncounting Marie....\nHe\u2019s a good driver, damn it! I thought angrily.\nBut I had already devised a picture in my mind of a drunk crossing the\ncenterline on State Highway 21, which rises and falls and curves its way to\nthe state capitol. How stupid,\nsenseless! I slammed my hand\nagainst the steering wheel, then just as quickly upbraided myself for losing\nmy temper. How could I know what\nhad happened? Jeff sure didn\u2019t.\nBut that was only part of it. When\nI told Marie what had happened to Charlie, she\u2019d reacted as any normal woman\nwould--shock, then an expression of pain and sorrow.\nBut I saw those exact same things in Claire\u2019s face.\nWhy? She didn\u2019t know\nCharlie Delahousaye from Adam; an acquaintance of an hour between a\nten-year-old and a stranger--a police officer at that--just couldn\u2019t account\nfor it.\nIt was yet another puzzle for me to figure out.\nBut I sure didn\u2019t have time for it now--not with Delahousaye maybe\ndying. Lord Almighty, don\u2019t\nlet it happen.\nBurleigh needed him. So\ndid I.\nAs I mentioned, St. Cloud is the state capitol.\nThat\u2019s both good and bad. We\u2019re\nclose enough, up in Burleigh, to take advantage of the things any reasonably\nlarge city has to offer: restaurants, the theater, a symphony (which Marie and\nI love to death). But like any\nstate capitol, St. Cloud is lousy with politics.\nI know, I know, it goes with the territory; yes, I know I\u2019m tainted,\nbut the scales just aren\u2019t the same. I\u2019m\nwilling to accede a moral superiority for petty theft over grand larceny.\nYou know, we lawyers have no business being in charge of anything.\nI don\u2019t see how any good can come of it.\nAnyway, St. Cloud has a fine hospital; just now, I had reason once\nagain to be glad of its proximity.\nWhen I walked into the emergency room, a nun working the reception desk\npointed me toward the on-call doctor\u2019s office.\nThere I found a young man who looked to be in his early twenties.\n\u201cDoctor?\u201d I said, knocking on the door frame.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he responded, then looked up, then he stood and accepted my\nhand, smiling.\n\u201cI\u2019m Tom Pippinger, from up in Burleigh.\nI understand Mr. Delahousaye was brought in here earlier tonight.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes. He sure was.\nAre you his next of kin?\u201d\n\u201cSort of. Charlie has no\nfamily between here and Georgia. I\u2019m\nhis best friend.\u201d\n\u201cI see. Sit down, Mr.\nPippinger.\u201d\nI sat.\n\u201cOfficer Delahousaye was in a single-car accident, which occurred at\naround eight this evening.\u201d\n\u201cSingle car?\u201d There\nwent the drunk driver theory.\n\u201cYes. His vehicle was\nhappened upon by an older gentleman and his wife, who called for an\nambulance.\u201d\n\u201cIs he all right?\u201d\n\u201cWe think so. He\u2019s in\nstable condition, and--\u201d the doctor looked at his watch \u201c--I believe\nshould be in a private room by now.\u201d\nI let out my breath; I\u2019d been holding it, and didn\u2019t realize. \u201cThank God he\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\u201cHe was unconscious at the scene, but came to in the emergency room.\nModerate concussion. Two\ncracked ribs, according to the X-rays. Some\nlacerations, plenty of bruises. He\u2019ll\nhave the headache to end all headaches.\u201d\n\u201cIs he awake now? Can I\nsee him?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry. Once\nhe\u2019d regained consciousness and the state police asked some questions, I\nwent ahead and sedated him. He\nneeds to sleep till morning.\u201d\n\u201cYou say the state police questioned him?\nIs the trooper still here?\u201d\n\u201cI believe so. Try the\ncoffee shop, just down the hall. He\nwent there to grab a cup of coffee while he filled out his report.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Doctor--\u201d\n\u201cWilliams.\u201d\n\u201cDoctor Williams.\u201d\nI met the state trooper, CAPT. C. McHENRY according to his nametag, as\nhe was leaving the coffee shop. \u201cExcuse\nme, Captain,\u201d I said to him, \u201cmy name\u2019s Tom Pippinger.\nI\u2019m here with Charlie Delahousaye.\u201d\n\u201cOh, sure; Chief Delahousaye,\u201d he said, accepting my hand.\n\u201cCould I ask you a couple of questions about the accident? I know you\u2019ve got to get back to work.\u201d\nHe stepped back inside the coffee shop, motioning me to a seat.\n\u201cIt\u2019s only a little bit strange,\u201d he said, sitting across from\nme. \u201cBut from what the doctor\nsaid, the chief got a nasty bump on the head.\nI\u2019ve seen this sort of thing before; they don\u2019t make much sense\nwhen they come to.\u201d\n\u201cWhat exactly did the chief say?\u201d\nThe trooper cracked a grin. \u201cHe\nsaid his car was hit by a twister.\u201d\nMy mouth fell open. \u201cA\nwhat?\u201d\nNow the man chuckled. \u201cI\ntold you they don\u2019t make much sense.\u201d\n\u201cSo what really happened?\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cHard to\nsay, exactly. The car was\nflipped. You can do that lots of\nways--hit a culvert, a ditch, take a curve too fast and overcompensate. But Chief Delahousaye insisted that a twister just came out\nof nowhere--like it fell out of the sky, he said--and picked up his cruiser\nmaybe fifteen, twenty feet in the air before letting go.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s incredible. There\u2019s\nno weather for it tonight--that was last night.\u201d\nMcHenry nodded, his lip curled at one corner.\n\u201cAnd the man wasn\u2019t drinking--I can vouch for that.\u201d\n\u201cMe, too. Charlie\u2019s a\nstraight shooter, except for a Pabst Blue Ribbon when he fishes and eats\nbarbecue. But he doesn\u2019t get\nbehind the wheel with it.\u201d\n\u201cAnyway, that\u2019s all I know. I\nleft out the twister part in my report, and wrote it up as a simple\n\u2018lost-control.\u2019 The insurance\ncompany\u2019ll raise the department\u2019s rates, but at least the chief won\u2019t\ncome off sounding like a lunatic.\u201d\nMcHenry stood, and lifted his hat and clipboard from the table.\n\u201cMr. Pippinger,\u201d he nodded.\n\u201cCaptain,\u201d I said, and watched him leave.\nAfter mulling things over for a few seconds; letting myself finish\ncalming down now that Charlie was going to be okay; I stood and went to the\npay phone in the corner near the door. Dropping\nin a nickel, I dialed 0 and waited for the operator to come on the line.\n\u201cYes, operator, I\u2019d like to place a collect call, person to person,\nto Marie Pippinger.\u201d I gave the\nphone number, then waited for the clicks, Marie\u2019s hello, the operator asking\nif she\u2019d accept the call.\n\u201cHoney?\u201d I said at last.\n\u201cTom,\u201d she said, \u201cthank God.\nAre you all right?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. So\u2019s\nCharlie. At least he\u2019s going to\nbe.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you the details when I get home.\nHis car flipped over, just before he crossed the county line according\nto the police report. He\u2019s\npretty banged up--concussion, cuts, bruises.\nThey\u2019ve sedated him.\u201d\n\u201cBut he\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\u201cYes, the doctor said he believes so.\u201d\n\u201cAre you driving back tonight?\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019d be better if I stayed here, honey.\nCharlie\u2019s got no family, you know.\u201d\n\u201cYes, you\u2019re right.\u201d Now\nshe chuckled. \u201cSee, I told you\nwe should\u2019ve fixed him up with my cousin Betty.\u201d\n\u201cNow Marie, I told you I wanted to keep Charlie as a friend.\u201d\n\u201cHa ha, Mr. Smart Aleck.\u201d\n\u201cAnyway, I want to be here when he wakes up, see if he needs\nanything, you know.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, darling. We\u2019ll\nbe all right here.\u201d\n\u201cI should be home by noon tomorrow, if all goes well.\nOh, and would you call Annie tomorrow morning and tell her what\u2019s\nhappened?\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, honey. I\u2019ll\nsee you then. Love you.\u201d\n\u201cI love you too, sweetheart. Be\ncareful driving home.\u201d\nI hung up the phone, went to the desk to ask for Delahousaye\u2019s room\nnumber, then made my way to the elevator.\nIt looked like being a long night.\nThe next morning, Delahousaye and I started off like we often do--at\nodds. He told me what happened.\nI told him it didn\u2019t. He\ninsisted. So on. The man\nwas sure hardheaded.\n\u201cThere weren\u2019t even any clouds,\u201d I said at one point.\n\u201cJesus, Charlie.\u201d\n\u201cTom, I know I hit my head pretty good; I\u2019ve got the headache to\nprove it. But I remember every\nmoment of what happened. None of\nit\u2019s even hazy to me.\u201d\n\u201cBut twisters don\u2019t just drop out of a cloudless sky. It doesn\u2019t ever happen.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, Tom, all right. Have\nit your way.\u201d\nI let out my breath, and forced a smile.\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, Charlie. This\ndoesn\u2019t make a heck of a lot of sense, us arguing. Why don\u2019t we just worry\nabout getting you home? Who cares\nabout what caused the accident, anyway?\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cYou\u2019d best\nget back. Marie\u2019s probably\nworried by now.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. I said I\u2019d be\nthere by noon, and here it is eleven already.\u201d\n\u201cThen get going. I\u2019m\nfine.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, Charlie. But\nI\u2019ll be back first thing tomorrow morning, to take you home.\u201d\n\u201cDeal.\u201d\nI hadn\u2019t planned to investigate Delahousaye\u2019s claim that a twister\ngot him. Way too ridiculous.\nBut I did find myself slowing the car and craning my neck, as I passed\nthe imaginary boundary that separates Arpent County from Jackson, where St.\nCloud resides. (No, I didn\u2019t\nthink doing so meant I was as crazy as Delahousaye.)\nJackson County is all flatland--what they call a river plain in\ngeological terms. Arpent is\nbasically foothills. There, along\nwith a more interesting topography, you find nice stands of southern yellow\npine, along with slash and even some longleaf.\nJust the thing for the timber and paper interests; which are just the\nthing for a rural southern economy. And\nthere\u2019s one more, albeit odd, use in a stand of pines: it\u2019ll tell you\nunfailingly if high winds have been through the area.\nNothing looked out of the ordinary, though, as I crested the first hill\nand began to wind back downward. The\naccident must\u2019ve occurred somewhere around here, I thought. But the pines stood in their casual regiments, like army\nunits awaiting orders, and the stands alternated with pastureland; there\ncattle grazed in blissful ignorance. Here\nand there a house; an occasional barn. There\nwas that old tractor, choked in scrub and blackberries, that I\u2019d watched\nrusting away for at least twenty years. All as it should be.\nThen, as I rounded another curve and started up a rise, the midday sun\nsparkled off the shoulder of the highway up ahead.\nThat could only mean one thing: broken glass.\nI pulled the Buick over, put it in park, set the brake, and got out.\nMy attention was drawn immediately across the highway, where I could\nsee a strip of chrome molding. In\nfront of the car were the countless little fragments of safety glass that\nmarked where a windshield had shattered.\nAnd in the grass and thistle running off the shoulder and down into the\nditch, other bits of chrome and more glass.\nThis was the spot, all right.\nI scanned the nearby landscape for evidence that something more had\nhappened than Delahousaye losing control of his car.\nTo my left was a swath of pastureland.\nI guessed it at two hundred acres--certainly no trees to be felled\nthere. To my right was the\ntruncated end of a hill; the telltale exposed stone.\nWalking along the shoulder, through the glass that crunched beneath my\nshoes, I kept my gaze fixed on the hill as it sloped downward into the swale\nbeyond. I was able to see the\ntops of trees in the distance. If\nDelahousaye was right, and a twister had somehow touched down here last night,\nthere should be some sign of it.\nBy the time I was fifty yards from my car, I could see enough of the\nsurroundings to know that no twister had cut its way through the area.\nNot last night; not ever. I\u2019d\nfaced the stand of timber off to my right.\nThese were thirty-year-old yellow pines, waiting patiently for the day\nthey\u2019d be made into saw logs. Shading\nmy eyes against the sun, I peered as deeply into the stand as I could, in case\nthe twister had leapfrogged off the highway and touched down again.\nNo, no sign of that.\nSatisfied at last, I headed back to the car.\nPoor Delahousaye, I thought, chuckling to myself; and I wondered if he\nhadn\u2019t stopped off after all for a Pabst or two.\nAt least he showed good imagination.\nMost people complain of pink elephants; Charlie Delahousaye went them\none better: he made up a good old-fashioned cyclone.\nThe word cyclone jarred me to a stop.\nMy breath caught in my throat.\nThen, without realizing what I was doing, I was running as best I could\nthe rest of the way to the car, jerking the door open, keying the engine to\nlife, and pulling away in a shower of glass and debris.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Claire?\u201d I asked Marie.\n\u201cTom, what is it?\u201d she said, her eyes wide.\nI\u2019d bolted into the house, not even taking the time to greet her.\n\u201cNever mind. Where is\nshe?\u201d\n\u201cDown the street, playing with Teresa Clements.\u201d\nQuickly I went to Tommy\u2019s bedroom.\nMarie followed. \u201cThe\ndress,\u201d I said, \u201cwhere is it?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the one she was wearing that first night?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cOver here. It\u2019s in\nthis drawer, for safekeeping.\u201d\nMarie had pulled the drawer open.\nI didn\u2019t wait for her to pull out the dress, instead grabbing at it.\nThe pocket--\n\u201cEmpty,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\nmust have the list with her.\u201d\nI tossed the dress aside and headed for the door.\n\u201cTom, Darling, what is it?\u201d\nI didn\u2019t answer. Once\noutside, I hurried past the four houses separating ours from the Clements\u2019. As I got closer, I heard laughter from the backyard;\nchildren\u2019s laughter--so innocent, so carefree.\nOnly just now I wasn\u2019t willing to believe that Claire possessed the\ncapacity for it.\n\u201cClaire,\u201d I called, crossing the yard.\nWhen she saw me, a look of panic transformed her face.\nNo, it wasn\u2019t just my intensity.\nThere was more; I knew there was more.\n\u201cTom, don\u2019t!\u201d Marie called behind me.\nI ignored her.\nClaire had been swinging; she\u2019d stopped dead still when she saw me.\nHer hands gripped the chains more tightly the closer I got, until her\nknuckles were white. Her face went ashen.\n\u201cThe list!\u201d I said, standing before her and thrusting out my hand.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got it, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nShe nodded, unable to speak.\n\u201cLet me see it.\u201d\nDeep in the grip of fear, Claire didn\u2019t make a move, holding onto the\nchains as if they were a lifeline.\n\u201cTom, please,\u201d Marie said.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to take it from you, Claire.\nI just need to see it.\u201d\nFinally she slipped one hand, tentatively, free of the chain, then felt\nfor the pocket of her dress without taking her eyes off me.\nOut came the list. Then\nthe other hand slipped free, and she unfolded the paper as she had that first\nnight, at last holding it out so I could read it.\nI took another step closer, then bent down so I could see the words\nbetter.\nMy heart pounded. I\ngripped my knees so hard that they hurt.\n\u201cMy God,\u201d I finally managed.\nI felt Marie\u2019s hand on my shoulder.\n\u201cTom?\u201d she said, very softly.\n\u201cThe word cyclone has a line through it.\nMy God. Claire, what does\nthat mean?\u201d\nShe\u2019d been fearful before. Now\nI saw raw terror in her eyes. Her\nmouth opened, as if she\u2019d answer, but all she could manage was a choking\nsound, then whimpering, as huge tears collected in the corners of her eyes.\nThen, like quicksilver, her gaze went to Marie.\n\u201cMommie,\u201d she said.\n\u201cSweetheart,\u201d Marie said, rushing to get between us, grabbing\nClaire off the swing and hugging her. \u201cIt\u2019s\nall right. Shhhh.\nIt\u2019s all right.\u201d\nBut Claire kept on sobbing. Marie\ndidn\u2019t bother looking at me, but I knew she thought I was a first-class\nheel.\nI didn\u2019t have the time right now to try and improve my image. \u201cMarie, we\u2019re going home now.\nBring Claire with you.\u201d\nMarie sat Claire on the couch, then sat beside her next to the arm.\nI was positioned in the armchair across from them, with the coffee\ntable between me and Claire. Marie was being protective.\n\u201cClaire,\u201d I began, \u201clast night an accident happened.\nA car accident. You\nremember when the phone rang?\u201d\nShe looked at Marie, obviously puzzled.\n\u201cThe telephone, Sweetheart,\u201d Marie explained, and she pointed\ntoward the table in the hallway, then pantomimed picking up the receiver and\nputting it to her ear.\nClaire nodded, and I could see that she\u2019d grasped the concept.\nBefore, I might\u2019ve wondered about that; not now, not that things were\nstarting to make a little sense.\nI went on. \u201cMy good\nfriend, Chief Delahousaye, was hurt in that accident.\nYou remember the chief, he was the one who brought you here night\nbefore last.\u201d\nAgain she nodded.\n\u201cClaire, the chief said that a twister picked up his car--picked it\nright up off the road--and that\u2019s how he got hurt.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Marie said, her eyes suddenly huge.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had time to explain it to you, Marie.\u201d\nI took a deep breath, and now felt a little wobbly, as if the emotion\nwere draining out of me. \u201cHoney,\nCharlie said it was a twister. Said\nit came out of nowhere. But you\nknow there weren\u2019t any clouds last night; the story was ridiculous.\u201d\nShe nodded in agreement, her eyes still wide.\n\u201cThe state trooper thought Charlie was nuts; you know, out of his\nhead--he got bumped all right, pretty bad concussion.\nI made it a point this morning to tell Charlie he was nuts, for\nsticking with his story. So on my\nway back today, I found where the accident was, I stopped the car and got out,\nand I looked for some sign that a twister had touched down--you know, trees\nsnapped off, whatever. Nothing.\nBut then I remembered Claire\u2019s list.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand, Darling.\nWhat\u2019s a child\u2019s slip of paper got to do with Charlie\u2019s\naccident.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to figure out.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t blame Claire for this.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m...not blaming her, Marie.\nI just want to know what really happened.\nTwisters don\u2019t appear out of a cloudless sky.\nChildren don\u2019t appear from out of the past....\u201d\nI watched Marie\u2019s face--the disarmed, almost helpless look.\n\u201c...Marie, Honey, I took Claire\u2019s dress over to Kate\u2019s shop\nyesterday. I didn\u2019t have a\nchance to tell you what she said last night; I was going to wait till after\ndinner, after you\u2019d put Claire to bed.\nBut the phone call; you know. Honey,\nit\u2019s Kate\u2019s opinion that Claire\u2019s dress was made a hundred years ago;\nit\u2019s straight out of the past.\u201d\nShe shook her head; her eyes had grown more skeptical, and she\nshrugged. \u201cBut there are old\ndresses around,\u201d she said. \u201cKate\u2019s\ngot some in her shop right now.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I know. But she\nsaid that Claire\u2019s dress was a museum piece; like it was made just\nyesterday; like--\u201d I looked at Claire \u201c--your parents aren\u2019t here,\nClaire, are they?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she said.\nThen she shivered, and drew her shoulders up, pursing her hands.\n\u201cI\u2019m confused about everything.\nI\u2019m scared.\u201d\n\u201cCan you tell me what you do know?\u201d\n\u201cI remember things. A\nhouse; a big house. Horses,\nbuggies, people; negroes working in the fields.\nCotton, white clouds of it, all around, carried by the wind in little\npieces, landing in the bushes and trees.\nI used to think it was flowers.\u201d\n\u201cThe house, Claire. Was\nit your house?\u201d\n\u201cI think so.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your parents were there, weren\u2019t they?\u201d\n\u201cMy father was there.\u201d\n\u201cNo mother?\u201d\n\u201cMy mother died when I was little.\u201d\nShe looked up at Marie; I could see the longing in her eyes.\n\u201cAnd your list,\u201d I continued.\n\u201cYesterday you said you lost your things.\nThat wasn\u2019t a mistake, was it?\u201d\n\u201cNo. But I don\u2019t know\nwhat it means; not yet.\u201d\n\u201cNot yet?\u201d I echoed. Then\nsomething clicked in my head. Maybe\nshe was confused. About\nher surroundings, her past, everything. Why\nnot? Imagine stepping a hundred\nyears into the future; imagine the shock of all the things around you, things\nnot even dreamed of in your own time. It\nwas like when they brought people from primitive tribes into modern\ncivilization. I was reminded of\nEdgar Rice Burroughs\u2019 stories, which I\u2019d loved so dearly as a kid; Tarzan\nof the Jungle. How could I\nexpect Claire to cope any better? She\nwas only a child. \u201cClaire,\u201d I\nsaid at last, my voice gentler now, \u201care you understanding things better,\nthe longer you\u2019re here?\u201d\nShe nodded. Her expression\nhad lost a good measure of the fear. I\nwas glad of it; I found I had no taste for badgering a little girl.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d I said. Then\nI remembered the list, the fact that the word cyclone had been crossed out. \u201cOne more thing, Claire.\nWhy did you cross out the word cyclone on that paper?\u201d\nHer face puzzled up; she thought for long seconds; then finally she\nanswered. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my\nthings. I don\u2019t know what that\nmeans, only that it is. Or was. I don\u2019t have it any more.\nI don\u2019t know what that means; only I don\u2019t have it any more.\nI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nI reached across the table and patted her hand.\n\u201cClaire, it\u2019s all right. And\nI\u2019m sorry I scared you earlier. I\ndidn\u2019t mean to.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said; and she actually smiled at me.\nChapter\nFour\nI waited till the nurse\u2019s aide had wheeled Delahousaye out to my car,\nhelped install him in the front seat, shut the door, and headed back toward\nMercy\u2019s front entrance, before diving into my extra-big helping of crow.\n\u201cCharlie,\u201d I said, trying not to let my voice sound too humble,\n\u201cI owe you an apology.\u201d\nHe narrowed his eyes skeptically, and I wondered if he\u2019d forgotten\nhis own story that I had lambasted him for sticking to.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he finally said. \u201cWhat\nfor?\u201d\nThat miffed me. \u201cDamn it\nall, Charlie, the twister. Remember\nthe twister?\u201d\n\u201cWhat twister?\u201d\n\u201cThe twister that picked your car up off of Highway 21 two nights\nago. Was there another one since\nthen?\u201d\n\u201cOh, that twister,\u201d he said; then he broke into a fit of\nlaughter--which quickly degenerated into a grimace and moaning.\nHis ribs. But he did\nmanage to smile a few seconds later, and chuckle at me.\n\u201cServes you right,\u201d I said, moving the gearshift to DRIVE and\npulling out from under Mercy\u2019s portico.\nWhen we\u2019d turned onto Bennet Street, which runs straight west until\nit dovetails into Highway 21 heading northwest, Delahousaye spoke again.\n\u201cSo what changed your mind? Did\nyou back-track to where the accident happened?\u201d\n\u201cThat I did,\u201d I said. \u201cBut\nyou can\u2019t tell anything from looking around there.\nThe twister must\u2019ve hopped right down on top of you, done its dirty\nwork, then vanished--back to wherever it came from.\u201d\n\u201cWhich we still don\u2019t have any idea about.\u201d\n\u201cNot true.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know where exactly it came from.\nI just know that Claire was somehow involved.\u201d\nDelahousaye eyes bugged and he looked at me, his mouth wide open. \u201cTom, a twister\u2019s one thing--that I saw with my own eyes.\nBut to claim that Claire was involved?\nDo you know what you\u2019re saying?\u201d\n\u201cCharlie, it struck me when I was out there on 21, walking through\nthe broken glass from your windshield.\nRemember that list Claire had, when she showed up at the library?\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d\n\u201cOne of the words on it was cyclone.\nI didn\u2019t think of it at first, because nobody calls tornadoes or\ntwisters cyclones anymore. So I\nrushed on home when it hit me, found Claire, and looked at the list again. She\u2019d crossed out the word cyclone.\u201d\nDelahousaye whistled, but said nothing.\nWe rode on for a few minutes before he spoke again.\n\u201cAre you saying she\u2019s a...witch, or something?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Charlie, of course not. I\nquestioned her about it. Night\nbefore last, after I\u2019d gone to Kate\u2019s and found out about her dress, well,\nwhen I got home I forgot the dress in my car--just absent-minded. Before, I\u2019d slipped the piece of paper in my top pocket for\nsafekeeping. Claire panicked when\nshe saw the dress wasn\u2019t where she left it.\nAnd when she didn\u2019t find the paper in it--\u201d\n\u201cHysterical, right?\u201d\n\u201cPretty much. But what\nshe said was, \u2018My things.\u2019 Not\n\u2018my list\u2019; \u2018my things.\u2019 She\nclaimed she\u2019d made a mistake; but yesterday, when I asked her again, she\nsaid they are things.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean those words on her list?\nThey\u2019re actual things?\u201d\n\u201cSo she says. Trouble\nis, she herself doesn\u2019t understand why, or anything else about it.\nThat night you were hurt, when I told Marie and Claire, you should\u2019ve\nseen the look on Claire\u2019s face--like she knew something bad had happened,\nand that she was involved in it.\u201d\nDelahousaye exhaled. \u201cTom,\nthis is all pretty far-fetched, you know.\u201d\n\u201cOh? Remember how you\nwouldn\u2019t let Claire stay with any family that has children?\nWhy\u2019d you decide that?\u201d\nHis jaw muscle worked for a few seconds.\n\u201cGut instinct. I told\nyou. That doesn\u2019t mean I\nthought the little girl\u2019s a witch or something.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying she\u2019s a witch.\nMaybe she\u2019s caught up in this thing--whatever it is--same as we\nare.\u201d\n\u201cWho says we\u2019re caught up in anything?\u201d\n\u201cWhere the hell did Claire come from?\u201d\n\u201cSomewhere. We just\ndon\u2019t know which where.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Charlie. Her dress,\nremember I said I took it by Kate\u2019s? That\nwas right after you and I spoke at the service station.\nKate says it\u2019s just like the thing was made yesterday.\nExplain that.\u201d\n\u201cA costume.\u201d\n\u201cNo. Kate authenticated\nit.\u201d\nHe paused a second. \u201cAll\nright. So it\u2019s an authentic\nantique dress. So what\u2019re you\nsaying?\u201d\n\u201cCharlie, I\u2019m not sure. I\njust have this picture in my head. There\u2019s\nthis little ten-year-old girl. One\nday she\u2019s going about her business--it\u2019s eighteen-fifty-something--and the\nnext day she shows up here, a hundred years later.\u201d\nDelahousaye stared at me for a long stretch of time, while I drove on\nin silence. Finally he clicked\nhis teeth, returned his attention to the highway and said, \u201cAnd the very\nnext night, the police chief\u2019s car was plucked from the highway by a\ntwister--only there wasn\u2019t any weather to account for it.\nNobody had an explanation. The\nonly person who had any idea what was going on was the little girl. Turns out the twister was one of her \u2018things.\u2019\u201d\nDelahousaye looked over at me once again, his head tilted back, his eyes\nnarrow slits. \u201cPlaythings?\u201d\nI stared back. I had no\nanswer.\nWe both thought a lot during the remainder of the trip. We tried once to talk about fishing at Lake Bear, but that\nwas no use.\nAt his house, I walked up the front steps with Delahousaye to make sure\nhe got inside okay.\n\u201cTalk to you later, Charlie,\u201d I said, distantly.\nHe nodded in reply, and I left.\nI hadn\u2019t yet decided to go talk to Dad, although I knew sooner or\nlater it\u2019d be necessary. But it\nwas worthwhile putting it off as long as possible: maybe the mystery of Claire\nwould somehow solve itself.\nYou ought to drop by anyway, I reminded myself as I drove away from\nDelahousaye\u2019s. It was normal\nfor me to check on Dad every few days. Since\nClaire had shown up, I hadn\u2019t been there.\nAlbert Pippinger is one of those men who seems to understand the world\nat large far better than his own place in it.\nIn the worst times of his life he\u2019d been the most stoic, resolute man\nI\u2019d ever known. Capable.\nFearless. Honest, even to\nthe point where it cost him; and it had, more than once.\nThe worst occasion was when he was scrambling for construction work,\nback in the Depression, and ratted out a foreman who\u2019d been skimming copper\ncable and selling it on the sly. Dad\nwas in turn accused by the man, and got fired even though they couldn\u2019t find\nany evidence to turn over to the authorities (it didn\u2019t exist, so how could\nthey?). A year later the truth finally came out; they had a big\nruckus, arrests and a trial, and four men got sentences ranging from three to\nfifteen years. Best of all, dad\nwas able to get regular work again.\nBut that winter before was the toughest of our lives.\nDad kept his chin up, though; did whatever odd jobs he could find to\nadd to my small (though steady) take from the Co-op. Mostly, he just hung on to his faith; he never took a\nmeal--or watched us take a meal, those times when he claimed to not be\nhungry--or lay down at night without thanking God.\nHe got us through.\nHe\u2019d retired several years ago.\nAfter much badgering, he finally convinced Mom that they could afford\nto travel and see some sights. Before\nthey could get started, however, she had the first of two strokes; the second\nleft Dad alone in the world. As\nalways, he faced her loss with stoicism and resolve.\nHe kept busy. Sunday\nmornings were still a time for worship and thanks.\nYes, I needed to drop by; but only for a minute, I decided. No need to\ntry dredging up the old stories--not yet, anyway.\nThe streets seemed oddly quiet, as I made the turn onto Hickory and\nheaded for the Vance Road cutoff to Shady Hill.\nMaybe it was me, I don\u2019t know. When\nyou get caught up in things that make no sense, things that won\u2019t come right\nout and threaten you but seem to anyway, you find yourself looking over your\nshoulder, listening for sounds you know aren\u2019t there.\nThey say the only true cause of fear in humans is the unknown. I guess that\u2019s true, but to me it\u2019s a moot point.\nHow much do we really know about the things around us?\nEspecially the people. Take\nyour loved ones. You live with\nthem; talk, eat, laugh, cry, work with them.\nBut there\u2019s so much more you don\u2019t know than what you do; there\u2019s\nalways plenty more iceberg, so to speak.\nI\u2019d seen that firsthand with Marie.\nAnd now I know for a fact that there\u2019s an inner self so deep and\ndistant--a place of utter darkness and silence where I imagine all our\nemotions converge horrifically--that it can\u2019t even be described.\nWhat is it that keeps us at the (not always bright) surface of our\nworld? Is it fear of that deep\nplace? Maybe so.\nMaybe we all understand, way inside, that without effort we can\u2019t\nstay afloat. But can we be pushed\ndown against our will? Can we?\nThe answer must be yes. Marie\nhadn\u2019t fled, those years ago; I was wrong about that.\nLife had simply managed to push her down hard enough, far enough. It had found that weakest part of her.\nNow I found myself thinking of Claire and all that was happening around\nus in terms of Marie. It was my\nduty to protect her. But how\ncould I keep from her that one most vital thing life had already denied her\nonce, then apparently changed its mind and given back?\nWhat right did I have? She\u2019d\ndone all that could be expected of any woman: loved her husband, made a good\nhome, gone to church, helped out with charities.\nShe deserved whatever second chance fate had given her.\nA bitterness suddenly rose in my throat.\nAnd I shook my head. No,\nI thought, it hasn\u2019t been given back to her--it\u2019s only an illusion, a\ncruel hoax. There\u2019ll be another\npush--this one fatal. Marie\u2019s\nbeing toyed with. Of all the\nthings that could have happened to her in the past two years, Claire was the\nbest thing possible. The worst\nbest thing possible.\nI tried forcing the thoughts from my mind.\nThere was no good that could come of any of this; I saw nothing but\nheartache. All I could do was\npray that Marie could withstand the end-result.\nVance Road makes a gentle climb as it leaves Burleigh\u2019s town limits.\nAt one time they grew some cotton in the fields flanking the road; that\ncommerce has long since been replaced by cattle munching Bahia grass.\nI had to smile: today, one of the calves had found a breach in the\nbarbed wire, and was enjoying the much-greener grass near the roadside.\nActually, none of us locals calls it Vance Road; rather, it\u2019s always\nthe Vance Road cutoff. Which is\nprecisely what it is and was: originally a shortcut to the old Burdett\nproperty and beyond. Near Shady\nHill it links back up with Highway 413 (which is the official name for Hickory\nStreet after it leaves Burleigh).\nThe history is mildly interesting: Vance made the transition from wagon\npath to gravel road to paved road in that subtle way that makes sense while\nnot being exactly strictly legal. What\nI mean is, the long way round was twelve more miles.\nThe Burdett family never cared one way or another if the cutoff helped\nfolks out--they lived a state over anyway, and the property was just something\nthat had stayed in their family through time.\nBut I personally like things legal, and one of the first things I did\nas Town Attorney was to draft up an agreement and see that it was signed and\nfiled with the court. Trish\nBurdett, the great-granddaughter and heir, wouldn\u2019t accept the money we\nfigured the right of way was worth--but she did take a dollar.\nFine with me. Case closed.\nI had made about two-thirds of the cutoff when it happened. I hadn\u2019t noticed at first, it was way too subtle when it\nstarted. But finally I had to\nadmit that the sunlight was growing less bright; like when it becomes\novercast, but this had a much stranger quality to it.\nThe word eclipse leapt to mind--you know how odd the dimming of the\nsunlight in an eclipse is. But\nno, there\u2019d been no mention of anything like that in the news reports or the\nFarmer\u2019s Almanac (which I love reading).\nAt last it was so dim I pulled the car over in the grass at the side of\nthe road and got out.\nThe first thing that struck me was the direction the light was coming\nfrom--to my left and behind me. Something\nwrong about that. I spun, and saw\nthat it was about to set. That\u2019s\nwhy it was so dim out. \u201cBut\nthat\u2019s crazy,\u201d I said aloud, then checked my watch.\nOne-fifteen! \u201cStopped,\u201d\nI said, holding it up to my ear. But\nno, it was ticking, it hadn\u2019t stopped.\nAnd it couldn\u2019t be dusk, not yet.\nI\u2019d dropped Delahousaye off at twelve-fifty--only twenty minutes ago.\nIn the middle of the day. The\ndrive to Dad\u2019s is thirty-five minutes.\nMy heart raced. I turned\naround slowly, scanning in all directions, trying to make some sense out of\nthings. The strange noise at my\nfeet, and the feeling of the roadway itself, drew my attention downward.\nGravel! \u201cWhere the hell\u2019s the pavement?\u201d\nMy breath came quicker now.\nThe sun was sinking beneath the horizon, much more quickly than it\nusually does. Darkness surged\nfrom the distant stands of timber, flooding the fields all around me like a\ngreat black tidal wave. The light\nfell away, as if extinguished forever; how could it withstand such raw power? And the air seemed to thin as well.\nHow could this be happening in the middle of the day?\nNow the road felt different still, and I realized that the gravel\nwasn\u2019t there anymore. I stood\nin one of the two ruts that showed the way wagons had been countless times\nbefore.\nMy face was suddenly brushed by a cold breath of wind, one of those\nharbingers of fall--the sun sets, the heat escapes the ground making a\nconvection that stirs the air until the calming, hours later.\nI shook from the cold and the fear that was mounting inside me.\n\u201cGet in the car, Tom,\u201d I said to myself, realizing it made no sense\nto stand there and shiver. But\nwhen I opened the door, the dome light didn\u2019t come on, and putting the key\nin the ignition and turning it only confirmed what I already knew: the battery\nwas completely dead.\nThen a glimmer of light on the windshield caught my eye. Where from? My\ngaze was drawn to the passenger window, then the back-seat window at my right,\nthen the back window of the car. There;\nthere it was. I could see a spot\nof light off in the distance. I\ngot back out, hoping to see whatever--hopefully whoever--it was.\nMaybe it was someone else who\u2019d been caught up in this inexplicable\ndarkness; maybe they knew something--anything.\nNow I could see that it was several people; they were headed my way.\nI heard their voices; eager, and tinged with something that struck me\nas almost...wildness. Sure; that\nmade sense. They must have been\nas baffled as I was.\nThe light grew closer. There\nwas an eerie glow to it, as if it had been cast onto a hazy black netting only\nto die there--and I realized that this night, or whatever it was, had come\nwithout moon or stars.\nAll right, Tom, so it\u2019s overcast; but that explanation didn\u2019t sit\nright. The morning and noontime\nweather had been crystal clear, with no prediction of a return to cloudiness.\nThe people grew closer still. I\nheard words thrown about, almost rampant in tone and pitch; the lights\nwavering above their heads; closer. \u201cDear\nLord,\u201d I swore softly, because now I could see the source of the\nlight--these people were brandishing torches.\nI edged toward the front of the car.\nMy heart was in my throat now; I could scarcely breathe.\nIn seconds they\u2019d reached the wagon path, and there was no more use\ndenying my worst fear: they were coming straight toward me; for me. But why? My\nGod, why?\nI couldn\u2019t afford to find out. Abandoning\nmy car, I moved up the wagon path at a pace just shy of trotting.\nThe Vance road cutoff (or, I thought crazily, what used to be the\ncutoff), though it\u2019s a straight shot, rides over hills and dips as it works\nits way gradually upward. Ultimately\nyou reach a crest that marks the highest elevation on the Burdett property,\nbefore the road falls again toward its link-up with Highway 413.\nAll in\nall the property measures five thousand acres.\nIt\u2019s a huge parcel of land, uninhabited and untended.\nWhich is an understatement. Agriculture\nleft it behind decades ago--failed agriculture, to be precise.\nNo one could ever explain why crops refused to grow there; plenty of\npeople tried, including (presumably) the original owners and sundry\nsharecroppers, and once a large farming corporation, with access to only the\nlatest in technology, took its own turn--and its own beating.\nAt last I reached the crest, and at that point figured it was best to\nleave the wagon path altogether. I\nhad to make it as difficult for my pursuers as possible.\nThe darkness had a quality to it that I am unable to fully describe.\nJust a few feet ahead of me, I couldn\u2019t make out even rough shapes.\nWith normal dusk, at least the eyes give over that ability gradually\nwith the encroachment of night; then you can count on the moon and stars, on\nclear nights, to at least provide some direction.\nI could see my hands in front of my face--all of my body in fact; but\nnothing else around me. Yet I was\nable to sense a direction, as if my legs were being moved for me.\nNow the ground beneath me was furrowed; I could see that much.\nOne foot would land atop a hillock, the next in a swale.\nYet I didn\u2019t stumble.\nThis ground was planted recently, I realized; I could see the\nunmistakable debris left by a cotton harvest.\nBut, I thought, they\u2019ve not grown cotton here in...what? thirty\nyears?\nNo time to stop and wonder. The\nvoices were louder, so much closer. I\nturned my head to gauge their distance; the light was a larger mass now, but\nmuch hazier than when I had first left the car.\nThey were gaining on me, there was no doubt of it.\nI broke into a run, the best I can manage with my bad leg. My heart hammered in my chest, protesting.\nBreathing, ragged. A fiery sensation lodged in my throat, spreading downward.\nYou\u2019re out of shape, Tom, I chided myself.\nNot used to running from crazed mobs.\nYes. That\u2019s exactly what they were; a mob. But what had I done that they\u2019d be after me?\nClaire\u2019s face suddenly appeared in my mind\u2019s eye.\nYes, that was it. I saw\nthe same dour expression she always gave me, but the naivete could no longer\nmask her guile. I\u2019d been\ndeceived; masterfully. Of course.\nThat explained everything. I\nknew she knew what this was--perhaps not clearly, not in detail--but she knew about\nit. Another of her \u201cthings.\u201d\nDelahousaye had been treated to one of them already; and nearly died.\nNow it was my turn. Maybe\nanyone who dared to question her, to try and find out where she came from and\nwhat she wanted, was also at risk.\nA shock ripped through me. Marie.\nWas she also at risk? But\nno, she hadn\u2019t raised one question to Claire; all she\u2019d been was a\nsubstitute mom, loving and caring, just what any little girl needs.\nBut would that matter? Claire\nhad struck me from the beginning as completely cold.\nShe\u2019d warmed to Marie because it was in her best interest to do\nso--she needed a place to stay, after all, someone to protect her, while she\nwent about her purpose. Who\nbetter than Marie?\nDelahousaye had accused me of calling Claire a witch.\nNo, I couldn\u2019t believe such a thing.\nIt was outrageous. But--\nThe burning in my lungs had grown unbearable; I knew I couldn\u2019t last\nmuch longer. But the crest I\u2019d\nbeen running along tracked on upward, a fairly slight incline but far too much\nfor someone in as bad a shape as I was. I\ncould swear I felt hot breath on the back of my neck, the voices were so close\nnow. The hazy light, too.\nIt seemed to envelope me, without illuminating my surroundings at all.\nAt last I reached my limit. My\nlegs had knotted up minutes earlier, painful from the exertion, and now they\nwere shaking so badly they wouldn\u2019t even support me.\nWithout any warning, I fell to my hands and knees, only managing not to\ngo sprawling completely. I had to\nplead with the mob closing on me; I had to beg them not to hurt me.\nBut I wasn\u2019t able to catch my breath to do so, each lungful of air\nscouring my throat and making me cough violently.\nRolling over on my backside and facing the approaching mob, still\ngasping for breath, I held a hand upward in hopes they\u2019d hold back long\nenough to enable me to speak, to reason with them.\nI had to find out what they wanted.\nIf only I could find out, surely I could explain, find some way to\nconvince them I meant no one any harm.\nAnd as I did I could see the light moving past me, at an oblique angle;\nno change of pace in it; the mob was moving on.\nRelief flooded my mind. They\nhadn\u2019t been after me at all.\nBut who were they? I still\nhad no answer to that question. Were they people I knew--people from Burleigh,\nor the county at large? As I\nwatched them move past, I could make out their features more distinctly--this\na new sensation, as if a fog were clearing--but I didn\u2019t recognize any of\nthem. They were all men, though.\nSome with beards, others clean-shaven.\nAnd their clothing: as it had been with Claire, they were clad for the\nmid-nineteen century; I knew it instantly.\nNow the mob no longer moved forward; they\u2019d reached their\ndestination. I kept still, a\nlittle fearful that they might yet turn on me.\nLong seconds passed. Then,\nas if on cue, there rose before them a shimmering in the darkness, as if this\ngreat tapestry of night were shifting against its moorings.\nIt reminded me of the Beech Theater down in St. Cloud, where it gets\ndark right before the movie begins, and then the show starts with a fade-in.\nShimmering light, shadowy shapes finally crystallizing into tangible\nscenery. And so here before us in\njust that way rose a home--a mansion, in fact, towering three stories behind a\nwhite-columned facade. But I\ndidn\u2019t recall any home of such description in the entire county--nor in this\npart of the state. Nor had it\nexisted at one time, then burned; you\u2019re always left with some record, a\ndrawing or painting, a woodcut--something.\nAs I watched, the mob moved forward again, advancing on the place.\nWere there people inside? I\nsaw no stirring, no indication of it. Only\nthe mob. And in the sharpening faces I saw the unbridled rage I\u2019d\nheard in their voices; righteous anger, made hideous in a nighttime I\ncouldn\u2019t begin to account for. They\nthrust their fists in the air, as if to assault whoever owned the place--his\nvery existence, by whatever tangible means was available to them.\nAnd on signal they split up and positioned themselves around the\nmansion, they shouted to one another their agreement, their rage-blinded\nintentions. \u201cYes,\u201d I heard\none of them cry, \u201cwe must, and all in this one night, it must be done here\nand now, completely and quickly, there is no other way.\u201d \u201cFor ourselves and our children, for everyone,\u201d a second\nadded. \u201cI\u2019ll see to our\nrelease; who else will?\u201d \u201cI,\u201d\ncame a shout in return. \u201cI.\u201d \u201cAnd I.\u201d And\nin unison these mad people set the home to the torch, and it flared up a\nghastly orange-red, that specter from who knew where, and quickly, so much\nmore quickly than homes ever burn.\nI watched the entire conflagration, a thing unreal, set apart in its\nown definition of time and existence. In\nmere seconds the flames had leapt to the topmost peak of the home; to the\ncarefully rendered top-railing--what\u2019s called the widow\u2019s walk--which\ninstantly became a framework of fire; up the roof to the ridge in a solid,\nred-orange-yellow sheet, to join a geyser of flame that had burst through from\ninside.\nThe mob had moved back, away from the unbearable heat, it had reformed\nitself into a mass of men now silent and watching in crazed delight; they\nlooked at one another, smiling, nodding, satisfied that they were ridding\nthemselves of this...thing...whatever it was.\nAnd now, amid the popping and crackling of the timbers as they burned\nto hot cinders, I heard a high wailing; I don\u2019t think it was human; I\u2019m\nsure it couldn\u2019t have been. But\nit persisted, even as the sound of the roof crashing inward brought a cheer\nfrom the onlookers, and first one wall then the next toppled into a cascade of\nsparks and bits of fire dancing a sad macabre ballet; and the massive\nstaircase which could only now be seen, listing to the side, teetering\nmomentarily, then collapsing in a heap of flaming splinters; still it\npersisted.\nNow I perceived a change. These\npeople, who had driven a hellblaze from within their own hearts and made it\nhorrid reality, let go their jubilance, all at once, almost like a great\nsighing; and a tangible fear swept over them, I could see it in the lines\nscribed deep in their firelit faces, they glanced from one to the other of\nthemselves furtively, questioningly--afraid, yes they were afraid.\nBut of what? Hadn\u2019t they rid themselves of this thing?\nThis...person, or persons, of course it must be human, what else?\nWhy did the word thing keep sounding in my mind?\nWords began to erupt from them, like the chirping of great birds, the\nsignal to flight, understood instantly. And\nthey turned en masse, and the chirping became a buzzing, then a thrum, then a\ndrumbeat that carried the emotion upon the air just as their feet propelled\ntheir bodies. Away from here.\nAway from it. Stampede of the fearfully relieved.\nBehind them, the mansion continued falling in upon itself, the fiery\nmass releasing its energy. In\nspark and flame and sullen ash. And,\ntoo, in a sensation I have to describe as frustration.\nWhatever existed there, that that mob had now extinguished, had yielded\nup its own hold on the earth. But\nnot willingly. Not for a second.\nThe mob streamed past me. Their\ndeed done, now they fled, all of them, no less worried or fearful. I saw in their faces that same look that follows the damned,\nthat can\u2019t be erased by any mortal means.\nAbsolution, the only answer. But\nfrom where? These people clearly\ndidn\u2019t know.\nThey passed on, oblivious to my presence--of course, I had no part in\nthis. But why was I here?\nWhat purpose did it serve? Because I\u2019d sheltered Claire, could that\nbe the answer? I shivered, as\nthat very primitive thought prized its way into my mind.\nAs children, we are taught that fate and darkness, or the spirits, or\nevil, or whatever specific hobgoblin happens to be represented, are not to be\ntempted. Do not interfere! How\nmany fairy tales are built on this premise?\nInterfere: and die! Take\nheed. Be forewarned.\nThis is no place for you. Begone!\nPerhaps I had been given a glimpse of some awful world, lurid,\ninexplicable, an alternate reality inhabited by demons who may only rise up on\noccasion, when their strength overreaches that of their\ncounterbalance--whatever that may be. My\nfirst instinct was to be rid of it all--Claire had to go!\nThen indignation shoved its way past the fear.\nTo hell with them!\nNow the people had moved off far enough that the light of their torches\nwas nothing but a flickering yellow haze, their voiced fears and imprecations\nnothing more than murmurings.\nWithout warning a chill gust swept over me.\nWhere from? I turned to\nlook back toward the mansion--but it was gone. Every trace. My\nheart sped. I had to stand, to\nget away. Something was sweeping\nthrough, forcing all these things back where they had come from.\nI knew it, without knowing exactly how I knew. Would it take me too?\nI had no intention of finding out.\nScrambling to my feet, I set off in the direction I\u2019d come from, at a\ntrot, not quite as fast as when I thought the mob was chasing me, but fast\nenough. The wind had picked up.\nIt whistled now, as if scouring everything it touched.\nI chanced to look back over my shoulder.\nThere was blackness behind me, not like nighttime but rather like a\nstrange absence of...everything. True\nnothingness. If you could somehow roll up--or draw inward--existence\nitself, bring it rushing toward a focal point, a place of total and final\ncollapse, this must be what it would look like.\nAnother wave of fear hit me, and I picked up my pace; a dead run now.\nMy breathing had been labored anyway; now it was harsh, and hurt my\nthroat. I\u2019d learned that the\nmob wasn\u2019t after me, but I had no similar confidence in this phenomenon of\nnature.\nAs I ran on, I noticed that the plowed ground became smoother beneath\nmy feet; the cotton bolls and torn bits of fiber I\u2019d spied earlier were\ngone, and random weeds forced their way through the crust, springing up around\nme; wild grasses, pioneer tree seedlings, and here and there a bloom opening.\nTime was reverting! This\nwas what was sweeping the Burdett property.\nI\u2019d been caught up in some backcurrent of time, that was how the\nwhole horrific scene had occurred, who cared how, it just did, and now, just\nas inexplicably as it came it was being pushed--or sucked, drawn, forced--back\ninto its place. This somewhere\nelse. I ran harder.\nBy the time I neared my car--I could see it ahead, just over the last\nrise--the wind was so strong at my back that it had blown my jacket up,\nthreatening to rip it from me. The\ntails lapped over my shoulders. Just\na little further, I thought. But\nthen what? The car was useless,\ndead. Clearly I couldn\u2019t outrun\nthis thing. I didn\u2019t belong\nhere, never did, it was merely a freak occurrence that I would be driving the\nVance Road cutoff at the precise moment in time when it chose to happen. That I had been caught up in its workings, was not of any\nparticular consequence. After\nall, who was I? So I could be\nswept away, without any special loss to the world at large.\nBut no. There was\nsomething else to consider. Claire.\nAll that I had been witness to belonged to Claire, or to her world or\nwhatever it was that allowed her to step from another time to ours.\nI had involved myself--unwittingly, to be sure--but nonetheless. To say that this event had been a random one was to ignore\nthe plain fact of Claire\u2019s arrival, and what Marie and I had done to see to\nher safety and well-being. Was\nthis a taste of some horrible vengeance that we were bringing upon ourselves?\nTo become involved: to pay the price.\nThe car. Now just several\nyards away. I had no hope that it\ncould carry me to safety, but at least it was shelter.\nPerhaps I could pass the windstorm\u2019s fury inside; I\u2019d have time at\nleast to think.\nWith a last lunge--my throat was on fire, my lungs at the bursting\npoint--I rounded the front of the car, gripping at the fender to keep myself\nfrom falling across the road, tore open the door, then leapt inside while I\npulled the door shut behind me. I\nlay across the seat, gasping for air, listening to the howling of the wind as\nit buffeted the car. Somehow it\ngrew still worse. The winds were\nnow at gale force, and the car was rocking.\nAmazing, I thought. The\nRoadmaster was a hefty four thousand pounds plus; Marie and I had sat in it,\nin fact, during Hurricane Audrey, and I didn\u2019t recall this degree of\nmovement. It was as if a giant hand were slapping at the car--at\nme--trying to dislodge my hold on reality, on life.\nDear God, I prayed, let it pass. Let\nit pass. Please.\nI thought of Marie. What\nif I died? But just as quickly as\nthe question formed I knew she\u2019d be okay, she was a strong woman.\nNo, the issue was much broader. What\nhad she done that fate would keep taking from her?\nWhy crush the kind heart? Was\nit the nature of things? It\nseemed that way, all too often. Marie\ndeserved better. Only I hadn\u2019t\nbeen able to give that to her, no matter how hard I tried.\nThe car suddenly lurched upward. I\ngripped the edges of the seat in panic. A\nblast of air had somehow gotten up under it, and seemingly with purpose was\ntrying to lift the whole affair. Rage.\nThat was the sensation. It\nmade no sense, but I could only ascribe emotion to what I felt in those\nendless seconds as the car teetered up, rising onto two wheels, balanced\nprecariously, threatening to roll over any second.\nBe rational, I told myself.\nBut my heart pounded in defiance of logic.\nNo, Tom. Calm down.\nEven if it turns over, it\u2019s well built.\nThe passenger compartment won\u2019t collapse. Yes. That makes\nsense. At last I felt as if I\nwere regaining control of myself.\nAnd in the instant I refused to lose all semblance of self-control, the\ncar heaved back down onto the ground with a jarring thud.\nI felt my teeth rattle, as my jaw hit the seat.\nThe breath was knocked out of me.\nGasping, I pushed myself up on my hands--then stopped midway and\nlistened. Quiet.\nYes. In just that instant\nit had gone, the screaming ocean of air that had blasted over the Burdett\nProperty and threatened to drive me back with the rest of the past.\nAt last my breath returned, my pulse slowing in step.\nI sat upright, behind the steering wheel, and ran a hand through my\nwind-whipped hair. Then a strange\nthing happened, which I later decided wasn\u2019t so strange after all: it was\ngrowing lighter all around me. Just\nlike when an eclipse ends.\nI had to know. In a bold\n(rash?) move, I jerked the door handle and threw open the door, jumping out\nand looking up where I knew the sun ought to be.\nI held up my watch, close enough so I could see the face in the dim\nlight. One-fifteen. I nodded. It\nmade sense. Precisely no time had\npassed, all during this episode. But\nthe sun was not where it should be. No,\nit was definitely brighter at my back, so I turned, only to be greeted by the\nsunrise--from the west! Sunrise.\nAnd my surroundings grew brighter, warm and golden, just as if the\nextraordinary were no longer so, but had instead become the rule of life.\nShading my eyes, I watched the sun climb and climb, making its arc, but\nin reverse. Within seconds it had\nfound its proper spot, that point in the sky from which it would, if you took\nthe time to set up your indicators, gauging them against magnetic north and\nallowing for the seasons, make a sundial read one-fifteen.\nOne-fifteen.\nDad.\nRemembering myself, I quickly got back in the car, and with only a\nmoment\u2019s hesitation turned the ignition key.\nThe Roadmaster barely protested this time before starting.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said, pulling the gearshift into drive and easing\nback onto the road.\nIt was only after I\u2019d gone a few miles that I realized what had\nhappened--or, more precisely, what had not happened.\nFor all that raging storm--the past ripping open and allowing certain\nhorrid parts of itself to be replayed, then the reaction, so swift and\nforceful, like great tidal currents surging home--not a blade of grass had\nbeen disturbed on the Burdett Property. All\nhad been left as it was before.\nOr so it appeared.\nNo, Tom, I reminded myself. Nothing\nis as it was before.\nI pushed harder on the accelerator.\nTwenty minutes later I eased into Dad\u2019s driveway, very slowly, having\ngrown more and more dazed by what I experienced the closer I got to his house.\nIt must have been some sort of delayed reaction, a type of shock.\nI could see him spot my car as I pulled in, raising up from under the\nhood of his old Hudson, then approach, wiping his hands with a red rag as he\ndid so.\nFinally I stopped the car, shifted into park, killed the engine.\nThen just sat there, staring through the windshield.\nDad leaned down to look at me through my window, at last tapping on the\nglass to get my attention. When\nhe saw my eyes, he opened the car door.\n\u201cCome on, son,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\nneed to come inside.\u201d And he\ntook my arm, and led me through the yard and up the steps.\nChapter\nFive\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Tom?\u201d Dad asked, once we\u2019d seated ourselves\nin his living room. \u201cIs it\nMarie? Is she okay?\u201d\nAlbert Pippinger is physically essentially me, just twenty-five years\nolder. Same build, maybe a little\nlong in the arms, same blue eyes, same light brown hair--his, of course,\nhaving begun graying on schedule, though I\u2019m pleased to say it\u2019s taking\nits time doing so. His face is\nthoroughly lined, but these are marks of character, not tiredness.\nAs I looked at him, I thought again how I could see pride and\nself-determination in his face.\n\u201cMarie\u2019s fine, Dad,\u201d I replied, shaking my head to clear the\nconfusion. \u201cNo, there\u2019s\nsomething else going on. In fact,\nI had been on my way out here to talk to you about it, and when I passed\nthrough the old Burdett Property--\u201d I paused, as a sudden thought struck\nme-- \u201cDad, did anything look out of the ordinary around here, during this\npast hour or so?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cI mean the sky; the sun; did it seem darker outside?\u201d\nDad thought about that for a few seconds, then shrugged. \u201cNot that I noticed. I\ntook my lunch at around twelve-thirty, then read the last bit of the Post\nI hadn\u2019t gotten to this morning. I\nwent back outside around, oh, I\u2019d make it one-twenty. A little before you showed up.\nTom, you\u2019re talking crazy, son.\nWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not really sure. Maybe\nI\u2019d better back up and explain everything from the beginning.\u201d\nI hadn\u2019t talked to Dad since before Claire showed up, so I told him\neverything I knew about her, as well as everything I now suspected about her.\nHe listened attentively, and as the story progressed his eyes grew\nwider, but not with surprise--it looked more like understanding.\nI admit it scared me.\nBut I had come out here in the hopes that Albert Pippinger could shed\nsome light on matters; maybe I just wasn\u2019t fully prepared for the notion\nthat he\u2019d actually be able to.\n\u201cAnd Dad,\u201d I said, once he\u2019d digested the story of Claire and\nnodded his head, \u201cthat\u2019s not all. You\nwant to know why I look like I\u2019ve seen a ghost?\u201d\nWith that he stood abruptly. \u201cYes,\nI do. But hold on a minute.\u201d\nHe stepped into the kitchen, and I heard fumbling in the cabinets, the\nclink of glasses. Then he came\nback, sitting across the coffee table from me, set the glasses down, opened\nhis ever-present bottle of Jim Beam, and poured us each a shot.\nSeconds later we\u2019d downed the whisky.\nHe sat back; but I was much too agitated, so I kept to the edge of the\nsofa while I spoke. \u201cThe other\nnight, Charlie Delahousaye\u2019s driving down to St. Cloud to check out some\nevidence, some cases he\u2019s involved in.\nOnly he never makes it.\u201d\n\u201cI saw the story in the Post.\nLost control of his car. Doesn\u2019t\nsound like Charlie to me.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not. Dad,\nCharlie said a twister picked up his car, and flipped it over and him with it.\nThat\u2019s what put him in Mercy.\u201d\n\u201cSo you figure that\u2019s what the word cyclone on the little girl\u2019s\nlist was all about.\u201d\n\u201cExactly. On my way back\nhome next morning, I stopped on the highway to look for some sign that a\ntwister had been through--sure, I thought Charlie was nuts, anybody would--and\nthen I remembered. So I rushed\nhome, demanded to see the list, and guess what?\nShe\u2019d crossed off the word cyclone.\nDad, she calls that list her things.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you think she\u2019s a witch or something?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ve never called her a witch.\nI don\u2019t know what she is. It\u2019s\njust that, whoever or whatever she is, she\u2019s evidently the focal point of\nsome strange force that I am at a loss to understand or explain.\u201d\nI paused, to pour myself another shot.\nDad watched, his look of fatherly concern more than obvious.\nBut I didn\u2019t care. I downed the whisky, so I could bring myself to relate what\nI\u2019d just been through.\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve got this little girl,\u201d I went on, \u201cwho shows up out\nof nowhere, wearing clothes that are a century old, with a handwritten list of\nwords she calls things, and then Charlie Delahousaye almost gets killed by one\nof them. If we\u2019d had the\nslightest bit of bad weather, I wouldn\u2019t have thought anything of it. But you know it\u2019s been crystal clear lately.\u201d\nDad sat forward now. \u201cYou\nhaven\u2019t told me everything that was on Claire\u2019s list, have you?\u201d\nI clasped my hands together, fingers knit, and let my head drop.\n\u201cNo, Dad.\u201d After a\nlong stretch, I looked back up at him.\n\u201cDo\nyou remember, years ago, when I started trying to piece together the exact\nevents surrounding the courthouse fire of 1859?\u201d\n\u201cDo I? I thought you\u2019d\nget lynched for sure.\u201d\nI chuckled. \u201cI probably\ndeserved it. You always told me\nnot to go poking my nose where it didn\u2019t belong.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that what\u2019s going on right now has something to\ndo with the fire?\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cYou know as\nwell as I do that the history of any given town or state or country is mostly\nboring. Every now and then\nsomething exciting happens, and, far less frequently, something truly\nremarkable happens. Arpent\nCounty, of course, being the exception to the rule, but that\u2019s just the way\nthings are around here. So\nyou\u2019d figure, what\u2019s so unusual about a courthouse fire--remarkable event\nthat it is--in Arpent County, of all places--that no one would be willing to\nwrite about it, or even talk about it? No\nwritten history; okay. But no\nverbal history? Well, it wasn\u2019t\nby accident; you know that, I don\u2019t need to remind you.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand, son. What\u2019s\nClaire\u2019s appearance got to do with the courthouse fire of 1859?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to find out.\nMaybe nothing. The only\nreason it occurred to me in the first place was the fact that Claire\u2019s\nclothing was straight out of the mid-eighteenth century.\nCall it gut instinct. I\ndon\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ve talked about it before, you and I.\nAnd who around town, old enough to have heard even whispers about those\ndays, haven\u2019t you talked to?\u201d\n\u201cNobody, Dad. Nobody at\nall.\u201d\n\u201cSon, don\u2019t you think there are some things best left alone?\nI mean, this little girl has shown up, and granted, something strange happened\nto Charlie Delahousaye, but that doesn\u2019t automatically mean you have to go\ndigging around in the past. Let\nit lie.\u201d\n\u201cI might take you up on that advice, Dad,\u201d I said, \u201cexcept for\nwhat happened to me today.\u201d\n\u201cTo you? But I\nthought...I thought it was what happened to Charlie, and that list Claire had,\nthat spooked you.\u201d\nI shook my head, my jaw muscles tensing.\nThen I peered straight into my father\u2019s eyes, in silence, for several\nseconds. Then I reached for the\nJim Beam, poured us each another shot, and handed him his glass.\n\u201cHere. Better drink\nthis.\u201d\nAlbert Pippinger, smart man that he\u2019s always been, obeyed without\nhesitation. When we\u2019d both set\nour glasses with a thud on the well-polished tabletop, he sat back and\nlistened raptly to every detail of how his son had been chased (or at least\nthought he had) across the Burdett Property by a crazed mob carrying torches.\nAnd the house, appearing from nowhere; its burning; the wailing sounds\nfrom inside; the amazingly frightened faces of the crowd, once it was over;\nthe gale that seemed to be sweeping everything back to...who knew where?\nAnd above all, the sun setting, at midday; and its rising again, from\nthe west. Impossible\nphenomena. All of them.\nWhen I\u2019d finished and sat back myself, Dad, fingers pursed, spent\nperhaps the next five minutes in thought.\nI knew, from long experience, not to say anything when Dad was musing\nover some complex puzzle; he\u2019d barked at me enough times as a young man till\nI finally learned the lesson: If you plan to use your mind in life, son,\nthen one, do it well, and two, demand the space for it.\nMeaning silence and respect from those around you.\nAnd he meant it.\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Dad finally said, \u201cwe tend to take modern\ncommunications for granted. Newspapers\nhave been around about since Gutenberg, but now there\u2019s radio and\ntelevision, and things are getting faster all the time.\nBut you know, Tom, they\u2019re always finding tribes in the most remote\nplaces who\u2019ve never heard of any of these things.\nThey live, I guess the best way to say it is \u2018out of time.\u2019\nTheir customs are so different from ours that we call them primitives,\nwhich in a sense I guess they are. But\nthe point is, we are always amazed at just how they live, what goes on within\ntheir very closed societies--from the beautiful all the way to the\nghastly....\u201d\nI nodded, even though I wasn\u2019t sure where Dad was headed with his\nargument. \u201cI\u2019ve read the\nNational Geographic since you started making me.\nRemember?\u201d\nDad chuckled. \u201cYes, I\nremember. The point I\u2019m making\nis this: the Arpent County of 1859 was not necessarily more worldly than, say,\na primitive society in Borneo. Which\nis to say that many things may have gone on here that no one in the world at\nlarge knew about. Localized\nsocieties may be open or closed, depending on who\u2019s in control of them.\nWhat\u2019s that got to do with us? you ask.\nWell, I suspect that, if you had pieced together the history like you\nwanted, you\u2019d have found that Arpent County was thoroughly closed off from\nthe \u2018outside world\u2019 for a period of time, round about then.\u201d\nHe leaned forward, and emphasized his next words.\n\u201cSo much so that, whatever it was that happened here during that\nspell was effectively erased. By\nfear, or shock or anger--by a crazed mob?--who knows?\nWhich would account for your lack of success when you went poking\naround years ago, not to mention the outright hostility you encountered.\u201d\n\u201cExcept from my own father,\u201d I added, smiling ruefully.\n\u201cNow Tom,\u201d he said, \u201cyou know a father\u2019s first duty is to\nprotect his family. So I said I\nknew nothing about it, and I didn\u2019t think you ought to ask any more.\nIt was only to protect you. I\nstill think it\u2019s foolish. What\ncould be so important in a little slice of history that you should outrage\nhalf the town to find it out?\u201d\n\u201cWell, Dad, I don\u2019t think I have the luxury of letting this dog lie\nany more.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that today was just another piece of this puzzle\nplaying itself out; is that right?\u201d\n\u201cI have no reason to believe otherwise.\u201d\n\u201cBut are you willing to take the risk that\u2019s facing you? Sure, if you insist I\u2019ll tell you everything I know.\nBut think long and hard before you do this, Tom.\nWhy is it your business?\u201d\nI ran a hand through my hair now, exhaling, and suddenly realized that\nmy heart was pounding--had been, in fact, for several minutes. \u201cDad, whatever it is, I don\u2019t really think I\u2019ve had\nthat much choice in the matter from the moment Claire arrived. Almost like it\u2019s come looking for me.\u201d\n\u201cBut you took Claire in of your own free will--you said so yourself.\nSurely another foster home can be found for her.\u201d\nMy temper flashed. \u201cNo!\u201d\nThen just as quickly I caught myself.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dad. I didn\u2019t mean to raise my voice.\nYou know, I\u2019ve blamed Claire--more than once--for what happened to\nDelahousaye, for what happened to me. But\nit\u2019s just as likely that whatever happened in 1859 victimized her as the\nother way around. I have no\nreason to believe that she\u2019s bad, or evil.\nWhat if...I don\u2019t know...somehow she herself was fleeing this thing,\nand it\u2019s sought her out, pursued her to the here and now?--\u201d\n\u201cDo you know what you\u2019re saying, Tom?\u201d\n\u201cSure. That there are\nthings beyond our senses and understanding, which despite that fact are\nnonetheless real. I\u2019ve been\nshown a little of that other world, Dad.\nIt scared the almighty hell out of me; but so what? I don\u2019t have any\nmore choice in the matter. It\nwon\u2019t let me. Whether I like it or not, I\u2019m involved. Okay. So I damn\nwell mean to do all I can to protect my own family, and my community.\nI feel responsible, rightly or wrongly.\u201d\nAlbert Pippinger thought about that for a long stretch, the silence\nheavy on the air. At last he\nsmiled wryly, until his right eye almost closed in a wink.\n\u201cDamn if I didn\u2019t raise you too good.\nToo damn much backbone to know when to run for cover.\u201d\nHe stood up, reached over and patted my shoulder.\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you however I can, you blamed fool.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d\n\u201cBut first, how about we switch over to coffee?\nThis may take a little while, and that Jim Beam\u2019ll have us on our\nbutts if we drink any more of it.\u201d\nI chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s a\ndeal. I\u2019m going to give Marie a\nquick call to let her know I\u2019m here, and about when I\u2019ll be home.\u201d\nDad went into the kitchen, while I called home.\nMarie answered right away; said she and Claire had been to school,\ntalked with Principal Houk about registering her for fourth grade.\nI agreed it was a necessary thing to do, then told her I expected to be\nhome in time for supper, and that I loved her.\nBut when I hung up, my stomach twisted a little more.\nMarie had taken things one more step--one more potentially devastating\nstep. But how could I stop her?\nDad knew a lot more about what I had come to call the \u201cmissing\nyears\u201d than he had ever let on. Not\nthat it was much, mind you, but compared to the sum total of my knowledge on\nthe subject it was like the Encyclopedia Britannica had been laid open in\nfront of me.\n\u201cYou see, Tom, this was right before the Civil War.\nIt may not sound like a terribly significant coincidence, but when you\nplace it all in the context of history, wars in general tend to disrupt not\nonly lives but also economic activity and, more importantly, communication.\nThe South was chock full of little enclaves during that time period,\nplaces which, first of all, were essentially self-sufficient, and secondly,\ngiven the gathering clouds of rebellion were more than happy to remain so.\nWho needed outsiders nosing around?\nSee what I mean?\u201d\n\u201cSure. What you\u2019re\nsaying is that Arpent County must have been exactly that way.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way to know for sure, but I think it\u2019s pretty likely.\nDidn\u2019t you say you\u2019d been down to St. Cloud, to look over the\narchives?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I just about went blind sitting in front of that microfilm\nreader at the state university. Came\nup empty-handed, of course. The Post\nread about like normal, so did the St. Cloud Herald.\nThen I branched out: The Atlanta Constitution, The Richmond\nObserver, The Times Picayune, any newspaper of note in the South.\nAside of society-type stuff--you know, Mr. and Mrs. Breeden arrived in\nNew Orleans today from Burleigh, bound tomorrow for Europe on the Essex--nothing\nof consequence.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I mean. Which\nmakes for two possibilities: nothing out of the ordinary happened, barring the\ncourthouse fire which I believe was reported in the Picayune; or\nsomething happened that was so terrible it wasn\u2019t even whispered about.\u201d\n\u201cWe can eliminate the first possibility,\u201d I said.\n\u201cPeople treated me like I had leprosy when I asked them what they\nknew.\u201d\n\u201cYes, that they did.\u201d Dad\nsipped his coffee, then sat back and made himself comfortable.\n\u201cThe first time I ever heard anything about the \u2018lost years\u2019 was\nwhen I was about twelve. Me and\nmy friends decided to take on a real challenge--me and Eddie and Weasel and\nGeorgie--and guess where we picked? Morse\nAbbey.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me; somebody dared you.\u201d\nDad chuckled. \u201cYou bet.\nBert Simon and Chuck Roan and their gang, we were always fighting over\nsomething. This time it was who\nhad the most guts.\u201d\n\u201cSo you took them up on it.\u201d\n\u201cYep; scared to death, but determined to show \u2018em.\n\u201cWhich we did, till about three in the morning.\nWe\u2019d drifted off to sleep, after bragging to one another that no way\nwe\u2019d do that no matter what, we could tough it out, and it wasn\u2019t ten\nminutes later that the three of us sat up, jolted from sleep, because we heard\na noise like nothing you could ever imagine.\u201d\n\u201cA good old-fashioned ghost, right?\u201d\n\u201cOh, no, son, nothing like in the movin\u2019 pictures.\nImagine the sound a shovel makes when it scoops up a good bite of\nearth; then the sound of that shovelful being tossed into a grave.\u201d\nHe paused. I said,\n\u201cOkay,\u201d smiling.\n\u201cNow,\u201d he continued, \u201cimagine that sound thirty, forty times\nover. So we stand up, and the\nhair on our heads stands right up with us.\u201d\nHe chuckled, without sound or humor.\n\u201cThe sound gets louder and louder.\nSo we ease around the abbey, along the side that takes you back to the\ncemetery, and we stop at the very edge of the building so we can sneak a peak\nwithout letting whatever it is know we\u2019re there.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s when you saw the ghosts, right?\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cBut it was\nnothing like you could ever imagine. That\ndirt shooshing sound, it came because the dirt was heaving up, not in neat\nrows like there were separate graves erupting, but one big area I\u2019d guess\nwas about twenty feet by twenty. The\ndirt rolled and heaved and almost boiled, as if it was being plowed from\nunderneath. This went on for\nseveral minutes. Then, we saw\nthem.\u201d He paused to take a deep\nbreath, then a swallow of his coffee.\n\u201cWho, I urged?\u201d\n\u201cThey were Negroes, Tom, I could see that very clearly even though I\ncould see straight through them. Their\nhands pushed up through the ground, pushed aside the dirt that had held them\ndown, then their heads emerged, and they each one of them, to a person, gasped\nfor air as if they\u2019d needed that next breath for a hundred years. This struggle went on for quite some time; and it was tough\nfor them, because they\u2019d been crowded together, you see, it was a huge\ncommon grave. But they labored,\nthey pushed and struggled, they dragged themselves up out of the ground.\u201d\nAnother pause. \u201cBut it got worse still.\nThese people were dressed all in tatters, trousers with frayed ends,\nshirts torn and open, hanging on their bodies, and we could see the bloody\ntraces of whip marks, and--\u201d Dad held up his arms, turning them over\n\u201c--there were chains, around their arms and legs, they were bound together.\nAnd once the last of them had emerged and stood, they looked from one\nto the other, all around, and then we heard the moaning begin, as if the pain\nhad suddenly been remembered and now had to be accounted for yet again.\nLow, at first, it grew to a wailing.\nI remember so badly wanting to turn and run, to get out, but I\ncouldn\u2019t; I was rooted to the spot, and so were the others.\u201d\nNow Dad paused again, and he sat forward as if it were time to at last\nconfide the secret of it all. \u201cGod\nhelp me, Tom,\u201d he said. \u201cThe\nwailing stopped finally, and all at once.\nThen these Negroes turned to face us, turned out their hands toward us\nas if to beg, and began to slowly chant, \u2018Gammon, Gammon, Gammon,\nGammon.\u2019\u201d Dad\u2019s voice had grown shaky; those events clearly had the\npower to disturb him to his very core, even sixty years later.\n\u201cWe found our legs at last,\u201d he said, smiling wryly.\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve never been back to Morse Abbey.\u201d\n\u201cDad,\u201d I said, \u201cyou should know that the name Gammon is on\nClaire\u2019s list.\u201d\nAlbert Pippinger now paled. \u201cTom,\nI think you\u2019d better get back home--now.\u201d\nChapter\nSix\nThe fire began thirty minutes or so after dark, ten or fifteen before I\nreached home.\nBy the time Dad had finished his story and I looked at the clock, I\nrealized how long I\u2019d stayed, that the sun had set (for real this time), and\nI needed to be home--even before he insisted on it.\nBut his words and the look on his face made me drive a lot faster than\nI ordinarily would\u2019ve.\nAs I steered the Roadmaster along the Vance Road cutoff--all the while\nwondering if there would be a repeat of my earlier experience--the feeling of\nforeboding increased in step. Something\nwasn\u2019t right. \u201cOf course it\nisn\u2019t, Tom,\u201d I said aloud. But\nthe picture that had fixed itself in my mind was one of Marie and Claire, and\nthe raw terror I saw in their faces chilled me to the bone. Whatever was happening in this place and time--whatever\ninexplicable thing--was drawing closer to us all. Like a tidal wave out of time, I thought--no, Tom, a tidal\nwave of time--a dark ocean of the past come to engulf everything,\nto blot it out, to sweep it away like a straw in a hurricane; thereby to\nreassert itself.\nYes, wasn\u2019t that it? Suddenly\nthe episode on the Burdett property made an inkling of sense.\nMy car had gone dead: as if the power had been sucked from it.\nThe transformation I\u2019d seen of the property itself, the ground\nreverting before my eyes, was nothing short of unbelievable--but if indeed the\npast were heaving itself up onto the present, perhaps not.\nAnd that mob, so tangibly real. From\nthe past. Like Claire.\nBy the time I turned onto Hickory, my heart was in my throat.\nIgnoring the 30 mile per hour speed limit, I shot past homes of friends\nand acquaintances until at last I spied the street sign that said Elm; it had\nalways said Elm, all my life, they\u2019d changed signs a few times as the old\nstyles gave way to newer types, but it was still Elm, it was still where my\nhome and family were.\nFamily, the word echoed in my mind.\nI realized, to my dismay, that in all that had happened to us in a few\nshort days and despite my best intentions to the contrary, I had developed\nfeelings for Claire, as if she were indeed the child we were meant to have\nhad; this role Marie had assumed so easily, and which I had resisted with all\nthe logic I could summon. Now,\nthat logic had failed me, my heart had taken over.\nBut you can\u2019t allow it, Tom, Claire doesn\u2019t belong here.\nNo, I knew full well that whatever was threatening to engulf Burleigh,\nClaire was a part of it; and when it went, so would she.\nDear God, I wondered, will Marie be swept away too?\nBut now another thought asserted itself--who said this thing was\ngoing anywhere? Perhaps we\nwere to be driven off.\nI jerked the Roadmaster into the drive, braking to a stop in a shower\nof pea gravel. The house was\ndark, so I left the headlights on so I could see, leapt from the car, ran\nacross the front yard and bounded into the house.\n\u201cMarie!\u201d I shouted. \u201cClaire!\u201d\nNo answer. They weren\u2019t\nhere.\nI wheeled and burst back onto the front porch--then stopped abruptly.\nSomething was different; something had changed, in just these past few\nmoments.\nNo time to try and figure it out.\nI ran back to the car, jumped in, turned the key--nothing.\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized that the car\u2019s headlights had gone out.\nJust like earlier in the day, this spot--my house and the immediate\nsurroundings--had been caught up in some eddy, some part of this dark current\nfrom the past. A shiver ran up my\nspine.\nThe courthouse, I thought, without knowing exactly why I thought\nit, but it was the right answer. Getting\nback out of the car, I set out at a dead run (which, due to my limp, isn\u2019t\nall that great).\nAs I made my way up Elm, toward the center of the business district, I\ncould see that some of the street lights were out while others weren\u2019t; I\ncould almost map the very distinct areas visually.\nMy fear ramped up a notch, but I did take small comfort in the fact\nthat I could still see where I was going.\nSome of my neighbors had taken to their porches, mostly the ones whose\npower was out, and they\u2019d set out their candles or Coleman lanterns or\nold-fashioned kerosene lamps on the railings; some engaged in conversation;\nthere were women who\u2019d picked up their knitting or darning, having fed their\nfamilies earlier; I could hear the rustle of the Post\u2019s evening edition as\npages were turned.\nA few called to me, but I took no time to answer.\nNo time.\nAnd then I heard the first wail of sirens.\nHow peculiar, I thought, that the fire engines still work.\nBut there was no accounting for where the currents had run, nor why.\nFire engines! Fire!\nNow I saw the bright yellow glow ahead of me, rising above the\ntreetops. It had to be the\ncourthouse; I knew it in my gut. And\nit had to be where Marie and Claire were.\nI emerged from under the canopy of trees that line the north end of\nElm, where it nears its intersection with Main and the residences give way to\nformer homes that have been converted to businesses and offices.\nThe splash of yellow and orange light, the fire throwing its anger onto\nthe night, was intense, frightening, making long shadows of the people who\u2019d\nbeen drawn to it like moths, helpless before the allure that every great force\nof nature holds for man.\n\u201cMarie!\u201d I called; I\u2019d recognized her form, even from a distance,\nand sure enough there was Claire right beside her.\n\u201cTom,\u201d she called back, spotting me and waving as I ran toward\nthem.\nI was gasping for breath by the time I got there.\n\u201cHow long?\u201d I managed.\n\u201cIt started about twenty minutes ago.\u201d\n\u201cI wish you\u2019d waited till I got home.\u201d (Gulp of air.) \u201cI was\nworried.\u201d\n\u201cBut darling, we were here before it began.\nJust standing, waiting.\u201d\nMy breath caught in my throat, my eyes widening in the process. \u201cYou what?\u201d\n\u201cClaire insisted we come here. I\ntold her no, we had to wait until you came home before we could go anywhere;\nshe just went to her room, changed clothes, then walked straight past me.\nI thought to make her stop, but something told me not to.\nFive minutes after we\u2019d arrived, the courthouse literally burst into\nflames. I...Tom, I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\ndid the right thing.\u201d Then I\nstepped in front of Claire, going to one knee.\n\u201cIs this why you came here?\u201d\n\u201cYes, partly,\u201d she said. \u201cI\nhad to come here, to make things right.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does that mean, \u2018make things right\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cI...I\u2019m not sure. I\ndo remember this night, so very clearly, the great fire, how hot it was, and\nthe light it made. Some things\nwere different, though; some of the houses and buildings, all of the people.\nSome things are the same.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Claire, some of these homes and buildings were here in eighteen\nfifty-nine. You remember that\nyear?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd this is nineteen fifty-eight.\nYou know that.\u201d\nShe nodded.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve come from out of the past, sweetheart.\nWe don\u2019t understand why.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s...\u201d she began, then she seemed to be overwhelmed by an\nimmense sadness \u201c...because of my father.\nI know that now.\u201d\n\u201cWas it something he did?\u201d\n\u201cHe...is here.\u201d She\npointed toward the courthouse, and in the same instant there came a loud\npopping noise which jolted me; I stood, turning to look; the building was now\ntotally engulfed in flames. Something\ninside must have exploded from the heat.\nI watched in fascination as the flames shot up through the clock tower,\neating the clapboard first, then the struts and trusses, then finally the huge\nbearing timbers.\nWhere are the fire trucks? I wondered; then just as quickly I\nunderstood that they wouldn\u2019t arrive, their engines had died suddenly and\nmost likely they now sat at streetside, their drivers puzzled, I guessed they\nwere over on Finch Street, maybe a few blocks from the firehouse but no\nfurther, useless, unable to bring the slightest alteration to the course of\nevents.\nIt was out of our hands; all but Claire\u2019s, it seemed.\n\u201cTom,\u201d I heard a voice behind me.\nTurning, I saw it was Delahousaye.\n\u201cCharlie, what the hell are you doing out of bed?\u201d\n\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d he said. \u201cThe\nlights went out at the house thirty minutes ago.\nSo I stepped outside, to see where Southern was having transformer\nproblems this time, and--well, I knew it wasn\u2019t your ordinary power outage.\nThen I heard the fire engines, but for less than a minute; saw the glow\nover the treetops; so here I am.\u201d\n\u201cClaire\u2019s a part of this, Charlie.\nShe doesn\u2019t know exactly how, and neither do we.\u201d\nHe nodded, still staring up at the courthouse clock tower, mesmerized.\nThen his expression grew still more disbelieving.\n\u201cGood God, Tom, look.\u201d\nI did. What happened next\nis not possible--at least not by any laws of physics I remember from back in\nmy high school class. It started\nin the clock tower: the fire had mostly consumed the timbers that had been\nraised in 1862 to replace those destroyed by fire three years earlier; only\nnow we could see that, instead of their eroding further as the flames ate them\naway, the reverse was happening--somehow the timbers were being reformed, were\ngrowing despite the fact that they remained involved in the fire. How?\nThe process continued. The\ntimbers were soon just as though newly erected.\nNow we could see the struts and trusses reforming, and even the\nindividual lengths of clapboard, seemingly emerging from the fire to retake\ntheir assigned places in the structure.\n\u201cThe old courthouse,\u201d I commented.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Delahousaye said.\n\u201cLook closely at it, Charlie. It\u2019s\nnot our courthouse. You can see\nthe slight differences.\u201d\nHe shaded his eyes and squinted, studying the clock tower. \u201cHoly cow,\u201d he said at last.\n\u201cBut how?--\u201d\n\u201cAnd look at the flames, Charlie.\nThey\u2019re retreating. Look\nhow they\u2019ve fallen back from the crown of the roof.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, Tom. It\u2019s\nunbelievable. But what does it\nall mean?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but it has to do with the power outage, with\nClaire--with your twister--with every strange thing that\u2019s happened\nthese past few days. I couldn\u2019t\ndrive here, my car is dead.\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cMine too.\nI just thought the battery was kaput.\u201d\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it. I\nhaven\u2019t had a chance to tell you what happened earlier today, when I was\ndriving through the Burdett property on my way to see Dad.\nIt got dark, Charlie, in the middle of the day.\nNot even like night, something much worse. My car died, so I got out, then I heard these people, I\nthought it was folks from around here but instead it was a genuine\ntorch-carrying mob, like something out of an old Dracula movie.\u201d\nDelahousaye whistled.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not all, Charlie. I\nran from them, thought they were after me, but they weren\u2019t.\nThen this house appeared out of nowhere, at the crest of the\nproperty--you know there\u2019s no house out there, and no record of one ever\nbeing there--but this mob burned it right to the ground.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now this?\u201d\n\u201cBurleigh\u2019s caught up in something, Charlie, something straight out\nof the past. It\u2019s why Claire\nappeared that night; not her fault, but she\u2019s involved in it.\u201d\nDelahousaye turned to her. \u201cHow,\nClaire? Do you know how?\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cOnly\nthat my father is here.\u201d\n\u201cHere?\u201d Delahousaye said. \u201cWhere?\u201d\nAnd Claire pointed toward the courthouse again--the courthouse which,\nduring the past few minutes, had almost finished shaking off the devastating\nfire which had destroyed it almost a century before.\nIndeed, the flames were retreating; only the ground floor was now\nafire, and the reversing effect was so rapid that it appeared the flames were\nbeing sucked back inside the building through every crevice.\nA silence now descended over the dozen or so of us who\u2019d gathered.\nThe fire was completely out. The\ncourthouse, the historic seat of justice for Arpent County, had been restored.\nI wanted desperately to go inside, to explore the building I\u2019d only\nbeen able to read about; in fact, I was about to take that irresistible step\nwhen the main door opened. This\ndrew a gasp from the crowd; Claire whimpered, half-cried, suddenly clinging to\nMarie\u2019s waist.\nStanding in the doorway was a man: tall and gaunt, with deep-set,\nburning eyes; full beard; very well-dressed for a man of the mid-eighteen\nhundreds, black suit with silk tie, high collar, fine leather boots. Clearly he possessed great wealth; his bearing said he was\nused to having things his own way. After\nscanning the crowd which now stood goggling at him, he descended the\ncourthouse steps purposefully, marching straight up to face me and\nMarie--especially Marie. I took a\nprotective step closer to her.\n\u201cMy daughter, Madam, if you please,\u201d he said, holding out a gloved\nhand, his words ringing out on the still night air.\n\u201cNot so fast,\u201d Delahousaye said, stepping up to challenge the man.\n\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d\n\u201cWilliam Gammon,\u201d he said. \u201cOwner\nof Vistray Plantation, along with a goodly portion of this fair town.\u201d He\nwaved his hand in a broad arc, a clear gesture of ownership and control.\n\u201cBe that as it may,\u201d Delahousaye said, \u201cClaire is being cared for\nby the Pippingers, and that\u2019s where she\u2019ll stay until a judge says\notherwise.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed?\u201d Gammon said, letting one eyebrow rise.\nThen he smiled, without humor. \u201cSo\nbe it. I shall return in the\nmorning, produce the necessary papers, and have the magistrate return my child\nto me and issue a reprimand to you.\u201d Now\nhe took a good look around, noted the strange faces, the many strange things\nof this world which was his yet had become somehow different.\n\u201cAlong with, quite possibly, the remainder of my property as well.\nI suspect that squatters and thieves have appeared, to try and take\nwhat\u2019s rightfully mine.\u201d Then,\nhis voice more forceful: \u201cI\u2019ll have none of it!\u201d\nHe tipped his head slightly to Delahousaye, then to Marie and me.\n\u201cUntil tomorrow.\u201d\nWe watched this man--and I confess I\u2019d felt chilled to the bone in\nhis presence--step away from the courthouse grounds, intent on his destination\n(I wondered briefly where that might be, then thought of the Burdett\nproperty--site of Vistray Plantation?). At\nthe far street corner he paused, standing ramrod straight for three or four\nminutes, and then we all heard the telltale clopping of horses\u2019 hooves, from\nmaybe two streets away, and several people gasped when a carriage came into\nview, straight out of the inky blackness that had enveloped this end of Bank\nStreet. It stopped to allow William Gammon to climb aboard, then the\ndriver called, \u201cGee-up,\u201d and the carriage moved off until it was out of\nsight and hearing.\n\u201cCharlie, what now?\u201d I asked, turning to our police chief.\nHe stood silently for a few seconds, then at last said, \u201cFirst of\nall, maintain order.\u201d\nI understood what he meant. Whatever\nhad overtaken Burleigh was here to stay--at least for now--meaning people\nwould be scared out of their wits (if I was any indication).\n\u201cWhat\u2019s second?\u201d I asked half-heartedly.\nDelahousaye looked at me; he wanted to shrug but dutifully did not;\nthen he clapped me on the shoulder and said, \u201cGet your family on home, Tom,\nand lock your doors and windows. Load\nyour pistol, keep it by the bed. We\u2019ll\nsee what tomorrow brings.\u201d\nI did as Delahousaye suggested, walking Marie and Claire back to the\nhouse, then locking the doors and windows and retrieving my pistol--a Colt .45\nI\u2019d brought back from the war--from its spot in top of the closet. Meanwhile, Marie lit a couple of oil lamps, then put on some\ncoffee using the old drip-pot she had stored in the cabinet (thank God she\u2019d\ninsisted we not convert to all-electric when I wanted to last year).\nThen we sat down at the kitchen table with our cups; Marie poured\nClaire a glass of milk.\n\u201cThat man is your father,\u201d I said to her.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know now what\u2019s happening to you?\nTo all of us?\u201d\nShe paused to gather her thoughts before answering.\n\u201cMore, now. I know that\nmy father died in the courthouse, that night very long ago.\u201d\n\u201cBut how was it that he returned?\nDo you know where you came from?\u201d\nAt this she shook her head. \u201cBut...things\nhe had done. I remember that\nthere were bad things. People\nwere scared of my father; and scared of me because of things he had done, he\nsaid to protect me. But I\nwas scared of him, too, only no one knew that, I couldn\u2019t be around anyone\nexcept for him and my nurse, he wouldn\u2019t allow it.\u201d\n\u201cSweetheart,\u201d Marie said, \u201cdo you remember what happened to your\nmother?\u201d\n\u201cShe died,\u201d Claire said, her tone so cold and matter-of-fact it\nmade me shiver.\n\u201cHow?\u201d I asked.\nShe was silent again, obviously struggling with herself--as if not\nto remember: those thoughts--horrid thoughts--lay at such a safe remove,\nbeyond a wall she\u2019d fashioned out of her fears and the need not to be hurt\nany longer, she must have felt that to recall them, to see that moment of her\nlife fully revealed again, would stop her heart beating and choke the breath\nout of her. \u201cHurt,\u201d she said\nat last. \u201cShe was hurt.\u201d Then tears sprang to Claire\u2019s eyes, and she sobbed without\nmaking a sound. Marie reached\nacross the table, laying a hand on Claire\u2019s to comfort her.\nMarie finally turned to me. \u201cThat\u2019s\nenough for tonight. She needs to\nget some sleep.\u201d\nI nodded, then watched as the two of them got up from the table.\nMarie took the oil lamp from the nearby sideboard, and led Claire off\nto her room.\n\u201cMy daughter,\u201d Gammon had said.\nNo, I thought. She\u2019s\nmine; I want her.\nChapter\nSeven\nWhen I was sure the dawn was more than just wishful thinking, I heaved\na sigh of relief, and then had to fight off a great wave of somnolence--now\nwasn\u2019t the time for it.\nWhat a rough night. Neither\nMarie nor I had slept for more than ten minutes straight--Marie in a chair\nnear Claire\u2019s bed, me tossing about in ours by myself (I can\u2019t ever sleep\nwell when we\u2019re apart).\nThe power was still off, and I\u2019d discovered when we got home last\nevening that the phones were also dead. It\nreminded me of Hurricane Audrey, just last year, when everything was dark and\nquiet for nearly a week. I re-lit\nthe oil lamps, so we could see our way around until enough sunlight had\nfiltered into the house.\nWhile Marie bathed, I took care of the coffee; the first, steaming\nswallow was an immense help to me, and I carried a cup into the bath for\nMarie, figuring the sooner she got the caffeine into her system the better.\nFinally, she came into the kitchen in her bathrobe, her wet hair\nwrapped in a towel, and took over and made me bacon and eggs, grilling the\nbread in a skillet to make toast.\n\u201cYou sleep any?\u201d she said, bending over to kiss me as she passed by\nto put away the egg carton.\n\u201cNo, and I know you didn\u2019t much either; I tiptoed to Claire\u2019s\ndoorway several times to check on you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll survive,\u201d she said, yawning.\n\u201cI\u2019m just glad that Claire slept all right; at one point, though,\nshe woke crying from a bad dream.\u201d Marie\npaused, her expression showing her concern.\n\u201cTom, she\u2019s scared to death.\u201d\n\u201cI know it, honey.\u201d I\nlooked at my wife more seriously now. \u201cWe\nall are. The only one who seems\nto know what\u2019s going on is Claire, and the details are damned sketchy even\nto her.\u201d\nOur talk must have awakened Claire; she appeared in the kitchen door,\nrubbing her eyes, then moved unsteadily and sat down in the chair at my\nright--her chair.\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d I said, making sure I kept an upbeat tone in my\nvoice.\n\u201cMorning,\u201d she replied.\n\u201cFrench toast, sweetheart?\u201d Marie asked, and Claire nodded eagerly;\nit had quickly become her favorite breakfast.\nJust as Marie put the first slice in the skillet, there came a knock at\nthe service door.\n\u201cTom? It\u2019s me,\nCharlie.\u201d\nI got up and unlocked the door, letting Delahousaye in.\n\u201cMighty early,\u201d I said. \u201cCouldn\u2019t\nyou sleep?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d bet about like you two did.\u201d\n\u201cMarie, we need more coffee.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d she said, chuckling as she reached another cup from the\ncabinet. Meanwhile, Delahousaye\nsat down across from me.\n\u201cI\u2019m no smarter than I was last night,\u201d he began, \u201cbut I\nfigured that Claire here is the focal point of whatever\u2019s going on, so I\nmight as well come over to see if we know anything new this morning.\u201d\nI nodded my agreement with his strategy, sipping my own coffee as Marie\nset Delahousaye\u2019s in front of him.\n\u201cThanks, Marie,\u201d he said; then barreled right in.\n\u201cNow, as far as Mr. William Gammon going to court and getting Judge\nHamrick to turn Claire over to him--no way in hell he\u2019s going to do that,\nunless it\u2019s over my dead body. I\u2019ve\ngot the State Department of Social Services backing me up, and in this town I\ndo the law enforcing.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t get overconfident, Charlie.\nThe man bragged about how he was going to produce documents,\nremember?\u201d\n\u201cFrom where? I\u2019m not\nthe historian around here, but--and correct me if I\u2019m wrong--there are no\ndocuments left from before eighteen fifty-nine, which is where Claire came\nfrom.\u201d\n\u201cTrue enough,\u201d I said, rubbing my chin.\nThen it dawned on me, and I snapped my fingers: \u201cUp until last night,\nthat is.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou were there, Charlie, you saw the old courthouse rising out of\nthat fire like the proverbial Phoenix. Do\nyou think for a second that if that could happen, those records couldn\u2019t\nreappear too?\u201d\n\u201cGood God Almighty,\u201d Delahousaye said.\n\u201cYou mean to tell me that that man can march into court, drag out\nsome papers that burned up a hundred years ago, and take this child out of\nyour home?\u201d\n\u201cHe needs me.\u201d\nWe were jolted; Claire had spoken up.\nHer words, and the strangely assertive way she\u2019d said them, sent\nchills up my back.\n\u201cWho, sweetheart?\u201d Marie asked.\n\u201cMy father.\u201d\nMarie went pale. \u201cNo. Tom, I can\u2019t let that happen.\nHe means her harm.\u201d She\nset her spatula down, and drew up the kitchen stool next to Claire\u2019s seat,\ntaking her hand. \u201cClaire,\u201d\nshe said, \u201cI think your father means you harm.\nI--\u201d she looked at me, then back at Claire \u201c--we, want to protect\nyou. We love you, and we want you\nto stay with us.\u201d\nClaire smiled, the innocent smile of a ten-year-old girl. Then her expression returned to the more mature, serious look\nI\u2019d seen that very first night at the library.\n\u201cI want to stay too. But\nmy father is here because of a...power-thing, I don\u2019t know what to call it.\nHe has sought me out, from beyond his own death.\nI know this now.\u201d\n\u201cBut why did you come here at all?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your part in it? Didn\u2019t\nyou...die, too?\u201d I shook my\nhead. \u201cThat sounds very\nstrange, I know; forgive me.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBut no, I don\u2019t remember my own death.\nI do remember that my mother died, but I don\u2019t remember how.\nEverything--\u201d she was struggling to recall all the disparate pieces\nthat made up the story of her brief life \u201c--became terrible after that; bad\nthings happened. I was so\nscared.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\ndon\u2019t have to be afraid anymore,\u201d I added, but secretly I thought, Tom,\nhow can you say that?\nClaire spoke again, but her voice was weak. \u201cI don\u2019t remember\nanything else until I was here. Like\nbeing asleep.\u201d\n\u201cYou said before that your father needs you,\u201d I said.\n\u201cDo you know in what way?\u201d\nShe shook her head. Once\nagain, we\u2019d exceeded the limits of her slowly unfolding knowledge.\nDelahousaye gulped down his coffee, and stood from the table. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get going, but I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d\n\u201cCrowd control?\u201d I said.\n\u201cIn a manner of speaking. Power\u2019s\nout all over town now. We\u2019ve\nbeen going house to house on foot, telling everybody to stay calm, stay inside\nexcept in emergencies, and so far it\u2019s going okay.\nBut I\u2019ve got to do something about the force\u2019s mobility; talked to\nJake Stevenson before I came here, and he\u2019s agreed to let us use a few of\nhis horses for as long as we need \u2018em.\u201d\nI laughed, remembering a conversation Delahousaye and I had had a long\ntime ago. \u201cBut you\u2019ve never\ndone any horseback riding.\u201d\n\u201cNope,\u201d he said, picking up his cap and heading for the door. \u201cGonna learn this morning.\u201d\nStepping back in time a hundred years comes with a host of problems.\nYou see, we\u2019re used to electricity, cars, phones--things which long\nago passed from being mere luxuries or perhaps curiosities to the exalted\nstatus of being basic necessities of existence.\nWithout cars you walk, ride a bicycle, ride a carriage, or ride a\nhorse.\nWithout electricity you wake at dawn, cook using gas or wood, wash your\nclothes by hand and dry them on the line.\nYou can stay up past dark if you want, but only by the light that\nkerosene or white gas provides--and it was in those first odd hours of\nBurleigh\u2019s return to yesteryear that the price of Varsol shot up to ten\ndollars a gallon before Abe Cole sold out of the stuff, without the slightest\nidea of when he could get more (he sure couldn\u2019t pick up the phone and order\nany). Like last year, with\nAudrey--only this was far worse, in my book.\nWithout a phone you can visit whoever you want to talk to in person or\nwrite them a letter (the Post Office being ever reliable, and they still\nhand-cancel everything in Burleigh anyway).\nIt was going to take some getting used to.\n\u201cI\u2019m off to the courthouse,\u201d I told Marie.\n\u201cYou stay here with Claire.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s...safe?\u201d she asked; and I could see the\nobvious concern in her face.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said, stopping to give her a reassuring hug.\n\u201cCharlie\u2019ll pass by here three or four times today, don\u2019t\nworry.\u201d\nShe nodded; I could see the resolve in her face, and it reminded me of\nhow much I admire her courage. I\nsaid goodbye to Claire, and she smiled at me, openly, trustingly. That made me feel great.\nI found Burleigh surprisingly peaceful as I made my way to the\ncourthouse on foot. Not that that\nprevented the sense of foreboding I still felt--it\u2019s just that none of us\nneeded a wide-spread panic on our hands; we had more than enough to deal with.\nThe events of last night had already added immensely to what little I\nknew of the 1859 courthouse fire. That\nit had been at night was certainly known; there had been some eyewitness\naccounts to that effect, which had been handed down dutifully.\nThese came with no additional information of course, and, well, given\nwhat had happened to me on the Burdett property, what Dad had told\nme--Claire\u2019s very presence here in 1958--I was beginning to get a glimmering\nof why.\nWilliam Gammon had been inside the courthouse that night a century ago.\nWhy? It could only have\nhad to do with records. What else? Along\nwith the doings of the law, court and arguments and justice meted out,\ncourthouses are places where the vital records of a given jurisdiction are\nkept. So Gammon had most likely\nbeen at the courthouse that night to retrieve some records, and on the sly.\nMeaning he didn\u2019t want the general populace to know what they were.\nBut I meant to find out; so I left home as early as I could, so that\nwhen they opened the doors at eight a.m. this morning I\u2019d be first inside.\nBy the time I got there, however, William Gammon had made a pre-emptive\nstrike of sorts. I ran into\nCharlie Delahousaye on the steps of the courthouse; the look on his face was\nnone too good.\n\u201cCharlie, what brings you here?\u201d\n\u201cJudge Hamrick,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\ncame to fetch me in the middle of riding practice.\u201d\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t say; but the judge said \u2018now.\u2019\u201d\nI tagged along.\nWhen we entered Judge Hamrick\u2019s chambers, the old man sat behind his\ndesk as always, dressed in his standard starched white shirt and red\nsuspenders (which the robe covered when he was on the bench).\nI\u2019d always admired the judge\u2019s face, the hard-won character lines,\nthe crafty eyes, the silvery white hair and broad mustache.\nHe was tough in court, but always fair.\nThe man knew the law.\nTo Hamrick\u2019s right sat William Gammon.\nHe was forward in the armchair, legs together, gloved hands crossed\natop a silver-tipped, beautifully carved cane.\nI felt my anger rise immediately when I saw him.\n\u201cChief Delahousaye,\u201d Hamrick said, properly acknowledging\nBurleigh\u2019s Chief of Police. But\nhis next words shocked me: \u201cMr. Pippinger, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here; I\u2019ve\njust sent a messenger to summon you and the child.\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon, sir?\u201d\n\u201cMr. Gammon here has come to assert his rightful claim to custody of\na young girl by the name of Claire for whom you have been, I believe,\nproviding foster care for the past few days.\u201d\n\u201cClaire has been in our home since she arrived in Burleigh,\nyour honor; but insofar as any claim is concerned, I must object strongly--\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d Hamrick said. \u201cAnd\non what basis, Mr. Pippinger? I\nhave seen documented proof of Mr. Gammon\u2019s claim, and once the child arrives\nand I satisfy myself that she is indeed the child in question, Mr. Gammon will\ngain custody of her.\u201d\n\u201cYour honor, Mr. Gammon wasn\u2019t even here twenty-four hours\nago. You know that, Chief\nDelahousaye has explained what\u2019s happened.\nThis is your courthouse, you know it like the back of your hand,\nyou know it\u2019s different.\u201d\nHamrick nodded slowly, and I could see the issues he was wrestling with\nplay out in the way his eyes flickered. \u201cBe\nthat as it may, Mr. Pippinger, I have sworn to uphold the laws of this state;\nwhether in this courthouse or any other--or out in the street--is irrelevant.\nMr. Gammon has presented his claim to me.\nIn the absence of some overriding legal challenge--and I remind you of\nthe standard of proof involved--I have no recourse but to respect his wishes\nas the child\u2019s father. You\nneedn\u2019t be reminded of any of this, I presume.\u201d\nOf course not! I knew the\nlaw as well as anyone, the presumption in favor of a child\u2019s legal parents. But I couldn\u2019t stand by and do nothing. \u201cYour honor, I believe that placing Claire in Mr.\nGammon\u2019s custody will be harmful to her.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what physical evidence do you have to that effect?\u201d\n\u201cNone, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n\u201cHave you heard Mr. Gammon, for example, threaten the child? I am aware of the fact that he asked you to return her to his\ncare last evening, and you refused to do so.\u201d\n\u201cBut the man came out of nowhere, your honor.\nFrom out of the past. Chief\nDelahousaye has apprised you of the situation, I believe.\u201d\nI heard chuckling from off to my right; it was Gammon, who now had a\nself-satisfied smile on his face. (I\nbadly wanted to smash it in for him.)\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Mr. Pippinger,\u201d Gammon said, \u201cyou do recall the\npropriety of the law, do you not? Its\nsovereign, noble purpose.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Mr. Gammon,\u201d Hamrick said, then he sat back in\nhis chair, making a tent of his fingers, drawing a deep breath and letting his\neyes close for a few seconds. Finally\nhe looked directly at me and spoke. \u201cMr.\nPippinger, the law must concern itself with facts--always--else it fails and\nwe must resort to mob rule. The\nprimary fact of any legal matter is the existence of the people it involves:\npetitioners, plaintiffs, defendants; in other words, of any and all parties\ninvolved. You cannot ask the law\nto negate the fact of Mr. Gammon\u2019s existence; why, my clerk has already\nfetched documentary proof to verify Mr. Gammon\u2019s claimed identity based on\ndocuments he produced independently; and now he has come here, of his own\nvolition, seeking custody of his daughter.\nI am duty-bound by my oath of office, in the absence of a suitable\nlegal challenge to the contrary, to grant his wish.\nSurely you don\u2019t suggest I ignore the law, to satisfy your own\ndislike of its result in this particular instance.\u201d\nJudges have a tough job. I\u2019d\njust watched Francis Hamrick, whom I consider a friend, make a decision he\ncould not, even under threat of death, avoid making.\nYet in spite of everything, I couldn\u2019t help but feel that he knew all\nwas not right with this situation.\n\u201cNo, your honor,\u201d I finally said, having no good alternative, \u201cI\nwould not suggest you do so.\u201d\n\u201cVery well, then.\u201d He\nturned to look at Gammon: \u201cMy secretary will bring in the order shortly,\nwhich I am having her prepare, to return to you custody of the minor child\nClaire Amanda Gammon; however, I will see her here prior to signing the\norder, to verify, as best I can, that she is indeed Claire Amanda Gammon.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, your honor,\u201d Gammon said, standing.\n\u201cYou have my own evidence before you, in the form of family Bible\nentries.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Hamrick said, \u201cwhich we will verify using court records,\nwhich my clerk is researching as we speak.\u201d\nHe then looked at Delahousaye. \u201cChief,\nI don\u2019t feel there is any need to involve your department in this; Mr.\nPippinger is an officer of the court, and an honorable man.\nMr. Pippinger, my messenger was instructed to bring both you and the\nchild along. Since you clearly\nwere not at home when he arrived, I suspect that the child remains in your\nwife\u2019s care, responsible woman that she is and so forth.\nSo would you please return there and fetch the child?\u201d\n\u201cYes, your honor.\u201d\nI turned to go, and Delahousaye was right on my heels.\nAs we left the office, I heard Gammon say to Judge Hamrick, \u201cNow, I\nshall engage an attorney to begin the process of reasserting property claims.\nWhom would you recommend?\u201d\n\u201cChrist,\u201d I said to Delahousaye as we descended the steps toward\nthe first floor. \u201cHas this\nwhole place gone mad?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he said. \u201cDid\nyou expect anything else, given all that\u2019s been happening lately?\u201d\n\u201cBut Judge Hamrick? You\nheard what he said, all that crap about the law.\nSurely he understood he was talking to a man who\u2019s been dead for a\nhundred years.\u201d\nDelahousaye looked at me. \u201cNo,\nTom, you\u2019re thinking with your gut. Put\nyourself in his place. How could\nhe decide otherwise?\u201d\n\u201cSimple; just tell Gammon to get the hell out of his court.\u201d\n\u201cNo. Hamrick\u2019s too old\na hand for that. He\u2019s by the\nbook, all the way, even worse than me.\u201d\nA mordant grin.\nWe\u2019d left the building now. One\nmore set of steps, and we were at street level; time to go our separate ways.\nBut instead we paused and faced one another; we were obviously thinking\nthe same thing, but unsure who should speak first.\nI decided it was my call. \u201cI\nabsolutely will not allow this to happen, Charlie.\u201d\nHis jaw worked for a few seconds.\n\u201cI know; but it could cost you your license, everything.\u201d\n\u201cNo. Marie\u2019s\neverything to me; and Claire--I\u2019ve begun to think of her as my own daughter,\ndespite my best intentions to the contrary.\nIf I bring her in and turn her over to that...creature, I could never\nlook myself in the face again. I\nwon\u2019t do it; I don\u2019t care what it costs.\nSo if you feel the need to arrest me, Mr. Chief of Police, then so be\nit.\u201d\nDelahousaye\u2019s eyes grew chary, and he clapped me on the shoulder. \u201cOnly if I catch you, Mr. Pippinger.\u201d Without another word, he turned and headed back toward the\npolice station.\nThere was no time to waste. Delahousaye\nhad told me, in no uncertain terms, to take Marie and Claire and go into\nhiding. Of course he\u2019d send one\nof his men to the house, but only after we failed to show at Judge Hamrick\u2019s\noffice and Gammon insisted that something be done about it immediately. That gave us maybe three, four hours. Plenty of time (I hoped).\nIt was almost eleven thirty by the time I stepped into my own driveway.\nMarie was standing there on the porch, a handkerchief clutched tightly\nin her hand, sobbing. I ran the last several yards.\n\u201cOh, Tom! She\u2019s\ngone.\u201d\n\u201cDear God! When?\u201d\n\u201cAbout a half-hour ago. I\nwent to her room to check on her, and she wasn\u2019t there.\u201d\n\u201cDid a man come by here earlier this morning?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but that was over two hours ago.\nHe said that Judge Hamrick needed to see you and Claire right away.\nI told him that you\u2019d gone to court, but that I wouldn\u2019t allow\nClaire to leave the house until you returned.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he left?\u201d\n\u201cYes, and I locked the door after him.\nTom, Claire must have gone out on her own.\u201d\nMy first thought was to run to the phone, to call Delahousaye. But the damn phone\u2019s dead, I reminded myself.\n\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to find her; we\u2019ve got to find her now.\nI\u2019ve just come from court--Gammon is getting a court order from Judge\nHamrick to force us to hand her over.\u201d\n\u201cTom, no!\u201d\nI nodded; my heart had leapt into my throat.\nI hadn\u2019t known how I\u2019d break the news--but certainly not under\nthese circumstances. \u201cBut I\nwon\u2019t stand for it, Marie, and I told that to Charlie Delahousaye. We\u2019ve got to find Claire and get out of here, hide\nsomewhere.\u201d\nMarie\u2019s face suddenly took on an expression of shocked understanding.\n\u201cMy God. I think I know\nwhat she\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\u201cDid she say something to you?\u201d\n\u201cNot directly, not like she\u2019d planned anything.\nBut Claire is remembering more about her life, Tom, about what\nhappened, with each passing hour. Let\u2019s\ngo sit down, and I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\nWe went over to the porch swing, where we\u2019d spent many an evening (in\nboth good times and bad).\n\u201cClaire\u2019s father was a cruel man,\u201d Marie began.\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t say this to me directly, but it came through in how she\nrecalled the things he said and did. And\nit was true almost universally: whether as a husband, neighbor--or slaveowner--William\nGammon was cruel. The only\nexception, it seems, was with Claire; which explains the hold he has over her.\n\u201cHe was rich and powerful. He\nruled this county, and from what Claire told me there wasn\u2019t anyone who\ndidn\u2019t fear him.\u201d\n\u201cAll that makes sense,\u201d I said, nodding with the realization that\nanother piece of this unbelievable puzzle had fallen into place.\n\u201cYou know how I\u2019ve always complained that we know almost nothing of\nwhat happened during that period in the county\u2019s history?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, chuckling, \u201cmore times than I\u2019d like to\nrecall.\u201d\n\u201cEvidently, when William Gammon died in the courthouse fire of 1859,\nthis mob rose up and destroyed every trace of the man\u2019s existence: his home,\nhis property, papers, records, everything they could lay their hands on. They were terrified of him, Marie--but like any terrified\ngroup of people, once they had the upper hand they became brutal, vicious.\nThey meant to expunge him from the face of the Earth; and they did just\nthat.\u201d\nMarie nodded. \u201cI think I\nknow why--specifically why.\u201d My\nbrow lifted; I felt the hairs on the back of my neck prick up. \u201cClaire said she remembers--although it\u2019s still in sort\nof a fog--the day her mother died. Mostly\nshe remembers it through the shock, the disbelief--and the subsequent\ntowering rage--of her father. You\nsee, Virginia Gammon was murdered; strangled, it seems, in the plantation\u2019s\nhorse barn. William Gammon, cruel\nman that he already was, pinned the blame for it on a group of slaves whose\nduties involved keeping the horses at Vistray: grooming, saddling, smithing,\nso on. He made no effort to seek\nthe real truth, to try and determine if it was one of them or all of them; he\nmerely blamed them all, whoever did it along with whoever failed to prevent\nit. Something of his had been\ntaken, you see.\u201d\n\u201cWhich William Gammon would never stand for.\u201d\nMarie nodded; when she spoke again, her voice was icy. \u201cClaire said he had them put to death. But I know that he must have whipped and tortured them.\nThen he buried their bodies at the old Morse Abbey.\u201d\nMy mouth fell open. \u201cThat\u2019s\nDad\u2019s story. Dear God in\nheaven.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, Tom? What is\nit?\u201d\n\u201cMorse Abbey is one of Claire\u2019s things, remember?\nPlus, when I went to see Dad he told me about the time when he was a\nkid, and he and some friends camped out at Morse Abbey on a dare; Marie, they\nsaw those slaves rise from the grave, from out of the earth, all shackled and\nscored with whip-marks. They just\nstood there together, chanting, \u2018Gammon, Gammon, Gammon.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cClaire has gone to her father,\u201d Marie announced coldly.\nI was speechless for a moment; then shook it off.\n\u201cI think she must feel a normal child\u2019s love for her parent; she\nmeans to help him. Despite\nanything he may have done.\u201d\n\u201cShe said he needs her,\u201d Marie recalled.\nI stood, and took Marie\u2019s hand.\n\u201cCome on, we\u2019ve got to get back to the courthouse.\u201d\nChapter\nEight\nWe noticed the first definitive change the moment we stepped from our\nporch: the day had grown distinctly dimmer, as if some portion of the sunlight\nhad been sucked away. It reminded\nme of my experience at the Burdett property--but this was much more widespread,\nappearing to cover all of Burleigh and who knew how much else.\nThe earlier calm that had kept the town in a sort of tenuous stasis--in\nother words, the people from taking to the streets for violent reasons--had now\nevaporated.\nFirst comes confusion: you see men and women out of doors, looking at the\nsky, smelling the air, raising their arms as if to supplicate, then turning and\nturning as if to regain lost bearings; next comes fear, which begins in the\nstomach and speaks through the eyes; then the people move, at first as\nindividuals, then gathering with others, splitting off, regathering and moving\nto seek out an object upon which to exhaust their fears by means of brute force.\nIt\u2019s the way of panic.\nWe were not being followed, Marie and I; but the people who were\nappearing as we hastened toward the courthouse gathered in behind us, for\nreasons both similar and dissimilar to ours.\nTo move, to seek out, ultimately to strike a blow for or against\nsomething. It\u2019s another of the\nhuman instincts, but thankfully seen only on rare occasions.\nThe farther we went, the dimmer it got.\nNow I knew it was the same phenomenon as before: the past growing\never-stronger, having first taken from us the more obvious pieces of our modern\nexistence, and then, having established that foothold, moving ahead to absorb\nthe remainder of our time, so as to destroy it.\nWhat part in this did Claire play? The\nold questions, the old doubts, had returned.\nDuring the past week I\u2019d grown to love her, as any father loves his\ndaughter; I wanted desperately to protect her, to keep her, to raise her as our\nown. But what if she was the key to\ncompleting Gammon\u2019s return to existence, his return to violent rule over this\nsmall part of the world? \u201cHe\nneeds me,\u201d she had said. Of\ncourse. Something had driven them\napart in 1859, perhaps the tragic fire that took the courthouse and Gammon with\nit. And Claire had been swept away\nby whatever forces were afoot, not to death but rather to another state of\nbeing--something like sleep, as she herself had observed.\nAll, evidently, until such time as she grew strong enough to return; was\nit so strange an idea, that a century might well be required for such a thing?\nThe disturbing part of it was that Marie and I had sheltered her,\nprotected her, all the while she grew in strength and knowledge, until the time\nwhen she could bring her father back. In\nonly a brief encounter, I\u2019d understood why there was no historical record of\nWilliam Gammon.\nI felt like a fool. I\u2019d\ntrusted, when logic told me not to. I\u2019d\nfailed to protect Marie.\nThe light breeze which had played its way through Burleigh\u2019s streets\nall morning now stiffened. Ordinarily\nI would think storm; and I guess this was a storm, only of a very\ndifferent sort. And far more\ndangerous.\nIt seemed hours, but at last we emerged onto Courthouse Square. The sky was darker still, like dusk but with more of a\nquality of nothingness to it. But I\nnoticed lights here and there, all around us in fact--torches, made of\nsticks or old tool handles wrapped with rags soaked in kerosene, and set ablaze;\nbright single points of fire made wild in the cool breeze. Many people were already here, with more approaching every\nsecond; I could hear the shouts, the cries, the unique language of fear.\n\u201cLook, Tom!\u201d Marie shouted to me over the rising din.\nThere, up ahead, at the sidewalk which runs along streetside in front of\nthe courthouse, stood Claire and William Gammon. Her hand was clasped in his, and she looked up at him with no\nhint of fear in her expression.\nMy heart sank; I\u2019d been right, she was lost to us from the very\nbeginning. But no, something inside\nme refused to believe it. Dear\nGod, I thought, there must be a way to bring her back.\n\u201cNo!\u201d I vocalized the thought, and Marie looked at me in shocked\nsurprise. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do\nsomething about this. Come on.\u201d\nTaking her hand, I quickened my pace, making straight for Claire and\nGammon. When we\u2019d drawn within\nseveral feet, the man turned our way, took two steps into the street and raised\na hand in warning.\n\u201cClaire has returned to her rightful place, by my side,\u201d Gammon said.\n\u201cEverything will be set to right.\nYou have no more business with her.\u201d\nHe wore the same self-satisfied expression he had earlier in the day.\nI ignored him, instead addressing Claire directly.\n\u201cClaire, it can\u2019t be true. This\nman, your father, hurt your mother and everyone else you knew.\nThink! Claire. Think\nback.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I remember,\u201d she replied evenly, without a moment\u2019s\nhesitation. \u201cBut he needs me,\ndon\u2019t you see?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Claire, it\u2019s wrong,\u201d Marie chimed in.\n\u201cHe needs you to accomplish this--\u201d she pointed all around us\n\u201c--this destruction of Burleigh, of our home; of all of us. Remember what you told me about your mother?\nHow she was killed?\u201d\nClaire made no answer right away, merely nodding.\nThen she spoke again. \u201cMy\nmother died. Father was hurt by it,\na lot. He loved her.\nHe wouldn\u2019t accept that she was truly dead.\nI know all these things now. I\nknow that he loved her so much that he even sent south for a woman, a Creole\nwoman who knew magic, to come and bring her back to us.\u201d\nClaire looked up at Gammon. \u201cShani\ncame to bring her back. Isn\u2019t\nthat right, father?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Gammon replied. \u201cAnd\nonce we have re-established our place here, we\u2019ll set about the task of doing\njust that.\u201d He looked from Claire\nto the two of us, while still speaking to his daughter.\n\u201cYou will do that, won\u2019t you, Claire? Shani gave you the power that night, didn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Claire said.\n\u201cBut first,\u201d Gammon said, \u201cwe must bring order to Burleigh, to the\nentire county, as it was before. All\nwill be as before.\u201d\n\u201cI will, father,\u201d Claire said. \u201cI\ncan do it.\u201d\nMy God, I thought; she is a witch.\n\u201cNo, Claire,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\nmust not listen to him. Resist\nhim!\u201d\n\u201cClaire,\u201d Marie said, \u201cremember how you said you wanted to stay\nwith Tom and me?\u201d\nThat seemed to get her attention; her eyes flickered, and I could see in\nthem the simple emotional need every child has for a mother\u2019s love.\n\u201cI remember.\u201d She paused for a few beats.\n\u201cI want my mother.\u201d\n\u201cI want to be your mother,\u201d Marie said, her voice quavering. \u201cPlease, Claire, let me be your mother.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Claire,\u201d Gammon said. \u201cYou\u2019ll\nhave your real mother. And\nsoon now. With Shani\u2019s power.\u201d\nHis voice rose, took on a bitter tone.\n\u201cThat fool! If she\u2019d\ndone her job that night, as I paid her to do, none of this would have been\nnecessary.\u201d\n\u201cCan we do it now, father?\u201d Claire asked.\n\u201cNot yet, Little Love,\u201d Gammon said.\n\u201cFirst things first. These\ntownspeople must learn respect; and the correct order of things in Arpent\nCounty. Together we will teach\nthem. With a show of power first, I\nthink.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve called our helpers, Father,\u201d Claire said.\n\u201cI can hear them coming now.\u201d\nShe pointed, on a line directly opposite the courthouse, down Main\nStreet--to a spot she couldn\u2019t see. Even\nGammon had to stand taller and crane his neck so he could see over the heads of\nthe people who stood in his line of sight; Marie and I did likewise.\nFor long seconds we saw nothing. Then\nwe heard gasps--and then screams--from those first people who saw them; and\nthese people parted, just like when Moses divided the Red Sea; and then we\nsaw them.\nThe slaves from Morse Abbey.\nThere were eight, ten--no, twelve--of them, and they stepped quickly and\npurposefully, a dull march on a straight line which did not vary, not in the\nslightest. It seemed as though they\nmust have business at the courthouse, for that was their obvious destination, I\ncould see it fixed in the dozen sets of eyes, eyes dead to everything except the\ngoal.\nThese Negroes were barefoot, wearing the tattered clothing Dad had\ndescribed, and I could even make out the whip marks on their bodies from this\ndistance. Oddly, they were not as\nghosts, no glowing spectral forms like you see in the movies; nor were they\nrotting, ghoulish corpses.\nNow the sound of chains came to me, the metallic clanking with each step\nof each one of them; bondage of life, and of death.\nThe crowd had stilled, hushed in terror, allowing us to hear the soft\nmoans from that cadre of beaten, murdered men, a cry rising and building until\nit verged on wailing. \u201cGammon,\nGammon, Gammon,\u201d they chanted, the same accusation they\u2019d made in their\neternal torment since that fateful day a century ago.\n\u201cNo!\u201d I heard a voice say, and when I turned I saw it was Gammon who\nhad uttered the word. He had a hand\nat his throat--terrified, just like the rest of us.\n\u201cClaire,\u201d he croaked, \u201cwhy?\u201d\nClaire looked up at her father, puzzled by his question and obvious fear.\n\u201cBut these are my things, father.\nI have them to help us, so we can be together again; just as before.\u201d\n\u201cNo. Not the Negroes.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Father,\u201d Claire said.\n\u201cI lost my cyclone before--but we can use them instead.\n\u201cNo, not the Negroes,\u201d Gammon repeated, his voice weaker. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand; they were meant to stay buried.\u201d\n\u201cBut why?\u201d Claire asked. \u201cThey\nwere bad men, who killed my mother. It\nwas right that you had them put to death for it.\nAnd now they are returning to make amends; isn\u2019t that good?\u201d\nGammon kept his eyes focused on the slaves, who continued their steady\nmarch, still chanting, the chains clanking a dull rhythm.\nHis fear grew by the second, and I could see that a cold sweat had broken\nout on his forehead. When he spoke\nagain, the words fairly gurgled out--and shocked all of us right to our bones.\n\u201cThey did deserve to die,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThey should have kept your mother from taking her own life--\u201d his\nnext words were shouted, in rage mixed with terror \u201c--from trying to leave me!\nThey should have stopped it!\u201d\nClaire screamed with the sudden realization, recoiling in horror; in that\ninstant she had discovered the ultimate tragedy of her past life.\n\u201cClaire!\u201d Marie shouted; which shocked the child aware, and\nshe ran straight to her, hanging on for dear life.\nGammon hadn\u2019t the presence of mind to react to this.\nNo, he was rooted to the spot, his entire attention riveted on the\nslaves; his chattel; servants; property; those whose existence was meant to be\ndefined by fear of, and deference to, him.\nBut those rules, he realized in this instant, were long gone; gone\nforever.\nIt was too late. By the time\nhe at last found his legs, upon turning he caught the toe of his boot on the\nsidewalk edge and went sprawling.\nThey were upon him: upon that screaming, quivering human monster who had\nhad them slaughtered a century ago, for the crime of having failed to prevent\nhis wife from taking her only means of escaping him.\nThey lifted William Gammon over their shoulders as he continued to beg,\nto cry--to literally howl--and they carried him straight into the Arpent County\nCourthouse, from where he\u2019d managed to find, with the unwitting help of an\ninnocent little girl, a means of returning from the hell he\u2019d been cast into.\nClaire had watched the entire scene--watched her father being carried\ninside by his own victims--and now she began a low muttering, words we\ncouldn\u2019t understand, a singsong that made a chill run up my back.\nThe courthouse burst into flames immediately.\nAnd the fire took its course much as it had the night before, only this\ntime I knew that the result would be to make things right--truly right.\nEpilogue\nIt was several hours later, when we were home and safe, that we learned\nthe rest of what Claire had finally remembered from those days. But it came in disjointed bits, for once the past had\nretreated, her very tentative grip on it (or should I say its grip on her?)\nweakened so quickly that by the time a few hours went by she knew nothing\nwhatever of her life a hundred years ago.\n\u201cShani arrived...days following my mother\u2019s death.\n\u2018Begin immediately,\u2019 father said.\nSo she did; it didn\u2019t matter to the voodoo. That night we sat...there was a table, oil lamp, it was a\nvery dim light. We sat around.\nShani chanted, swayed, spoke words I didn\u2019t understand.\nBegging, I guess, for mother to return.\n\u201cThen...all of a sudden she screamed.\u201d\nA beat. \u201cWhat she said\nnext scared me to death. I didn\u2019t\nremember until my father said it before. \u2018She\nhas died at her own hand,\u2019 Shani said. \u2018Do\nnot wish to return.\u2019 And then, to\nmy father, \u2018You have killed to avenge this?\u2019\n\u201cHis face turned white. Then\nhe took me...to the courthouse...to town. We\nnever went to town after dark. He\nsaid something about buying slaves, about records.\nAnyway, he made me wait outside. So\nI did. But Shani had followed us,\nand she came up to me. I was scared\nof her. \u2018It is wrong,\u2019 she\nsaid. \u2018Leave your mother.\u2019\nAnd I...\n\u201c...finally said, \u2018No, I must obey my father.\u2019\nShe was angry; very angry. \u2018So\nbe it,\u2019 she said. \u2018The bond\nbetween you and your father shall remain...until you are willing to break it, to\nend the evil.\u2019\n\u201cShe...made the courthouse burn. And\nthen....\u201d\nAnd just that quickly, Claire\u2019s memory of the past ended.\nMarie hushed my prodding and simply hugged her, for long minutes, until\nshe fell asleep from sheer exhaustion; then I took over and carried her to her\nroom.\nThings were back to normal by the next morning--power, phone, cars.\nWe\u2019d returned to 1958.\nI took the morning off, just to rest up from everything.\nTrue to womanhood, Claire and Marie bundled off to town for more\nshopping--school clothes for Claire, whatever Marie could find for Marie.\nDelahousaye showed up around ten, apparently to check on us. I was stepping out onto the porch when he got out of his car\ngingerly then limped over.\n\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d I called, chuckling; I knew the answer before\nI even asked.\n\u201cDamn patrol vehicle threw me yesterday afternoon,\u201d he quipped,\nclimbing the steps and grimacing as he did so.\n\u201cSure is good to have wheels again.\u201d\nWe had a cup of coffee together, made plans for that Lake Bear trip; then\nhe went about his business.\nIt\u2019s been six months now, and Claire still has no memory of her past; I\nhave every confidence it\u2019s buried for good.\nBut I\u2019m still miffed at Judge Hamrick; he\u2019s the most inflexible man\nI\u2019ve ever known when it comes to by-the-book law.\nIt was worth the wait, though. The\nadoption papers are signed, sealed and duly recorded in the Arpent County\nCourthouse.\nClaire Amanda Pippinger is all ours.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050421121801\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/octdec2001\/claire.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The Internet's Premier Magazine of Historical Science Fiction","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/C2Ve2YuAAHG2Uj3prKUvNH5hJwE.json","volume":2.0,"issues":3.0,"has_text":true}

His own wife, Lucy, had put on her most flamboyant\nred dress for the occasion, but was unable to attend, since\nArchibald had locked her up in the pantry of their estate.\nSatterthwaite checked the mass of wires flowing from \"The\nBlack Box\", the heart of his invention, to the tens\nof thousands of incandescent lamps he had joined together\nin a vast array behind the screen itself, made of fabulously\nexpensive silver silk he had imported from China. The screen\nmeasured thirty-five feet long and twenty feet high and\nshimmered in the light of the sun setting behind it. Once\nthe last ray of direct natural light had disappeared, Archibald\nSatterthwaite emerged from behind the screen and addressed\nthe politely clapping audience.\nBack in his New York days, Archibald and his twin brother\nArnold had experimented obsessively with all manners of\narts and natural sciences. While Arnold was a born painter\nand poet destined for greatness, Archibald was blessed with\nmedical gifts and a tough entrepreneurial spirit. Despite\ntheir combined talents, their efforts to gain fame and fortune\nthrough beautifully crafted anatomical models and illustrated\ntextbooks quickly failed. By the time Arnold died in a tragic\ncarriage accident in 1873, the brothers were a hair's breadth\nfrom broke. Archibald financed his journey to California\nby selling off their remaining equipment. He arrived in\nSan Francisco on the recently completed Pacific railroad\nwith only a single traveler's trunk, his bride, and a large\nblack box that he kept by his side at all times.\nCharmed by Satterthwaite's quick wit and supposed financial\nacumen, Leland Stanford hired him as his accountant for\nthe extension of the Southern Pacific down the California\ncoast. By the time the railroad reached Los Angeles in 1876,\nArchibald Satterthwaite had siphoned off sufficient paycheck\nfunds to buy himself a large estate in the hills of Rancho\nLa Brea overlooking the town. Over the next five years,\nas the railroad bosses sold the cow pastures of Los Angeles\nas the new frontier of opportunity, luring a new rush of\nsettlers from the East, Satterthwaite quintupled his modest\nfortune through wise land investments.\nAfter years of scientific drudgery, persuading financiers\nto invest in his undertaking, and hundreds of telegraphic\nexchanges with Thomas Edison in Menlo Park, New Jersey,\nArchibald Satterthwaite had finally obtained the large number\nand high quality of incandescent lamps he needed (he had\nquickly become the largest procurer of incandescent lamps\nin the world after the City of New York, and he coaxed Edison\nwith generous funds and promises of scientific grandeur\nto improve on his invention to enable sudden and repeated\nchanges in luminosity); he had located the quality and size\nof Chinese silk he desired, and he had developed the fine\nwiring connecting the Black Box to the incandescent lamp\narray. He invited the elite of California, many of whom\njourneyed reluctantly from their comfortable homes in San\nFrancisco, lured only by the intrigue of this unusual invention\nto the backwater of Los Angeles.\n\"Gentlemen! Ladies!\" Satterthwaite's baritone\nboomed through the crisp evening air. \"You have come\nhere today to witness history in the making. I dedicate\nthis momentous happening to the memory of my beloved brother\nArnold, without whom none of what you see today would have\nbeen possible. Today, on the third anniversary of Leland\nStanford's striking demonstration of the power of serial\nphotography, I will usher you into a grand era of the imagination,\na new opportunity that will make even the railroad seem\nlike an amateur's investment. Before you, behold, the Silver\nScreen!\"\nLeland Stanford, sitting in the front row as a guest of\nhonor, whispered into the ear of Marion McKinley Bovard,\nthe university president: \"This had better be good.\nWhen I hired Eadweard Muybridge to take a series of photographs\nof my galloping horse, I only had to venture as far as my\nstables.\"\nSatterthwaite moved to the side of the screen where the\nBlack Box stood, then flipped a large switch protruding\nfrom its insides.\nThe audience fell silent. On the Silver Screen, images of\nremarkable intensity flashed across the screen. Each individual\nincandescent lamp in the array pulsated at a rate of sixteen\nper second, varying its luminosity according to the electrical\nimpulses it received through the wires emanating from the\nBlack Box. The incandescent lamps shone onto the Silver\nScreen from behind; viewed from the front, the individual\npatterns of light on the screen blurred together, combining\ninto a single image. These flashing pictures, alternating\nat a rate of sixteen per second, in turn combined in the\nspectator's brain to create the illusion of almost seamless\nmotion.\nThe audience first saw a carriage speeding through the streets\nof Manhattan, the driver's black coat billowing out behind\nhim. The picture of the carriage filled half of the screen;\nthe driver reached ten feet tall above the crowd. As he\nturned a sharp corner, his hat flew off his head, spinning\nin the direction of the spectators. A collective gasp went\nup from the audience.\nA deep voice crowd called out from the\ncrowd: \"It's a theater!\" A nervous voice responded:\n\"But who are the actors? Where are the sets?\"\nThe images were silent, save the hum of the lamps and the\nbristle of electric current being shut on and off with rapid\nfrequency. The driver continued over a narrow cobblestone\nalley between tenement buildings. Now that his hat had fallen\noff, the audience could see his sharp, dark features and\nthe scowl on his face. Suddenly, the perspective shifted:\nthe image of the driver melted into a view of the carriage\nfrom the front, barreling toward the spectators.\n\"It's black magic! The work of the devil!\" a young\nrancher yelled from the audience.\nJust before the image of the carriage filled the screen\nentirely, the perspective shifted again, as if the viewer\nhad been pushed into the path of the carriage. The horses\nreared, then bolted, and the last image was of hooves crashing\ndown as the screen went dark.\nFor a full ten seconds, nobody spoke. Then, the wife of\na local cattle rancher screamed. This broke the tension,\nand the crowd first erupted into a roar of nervous laughter,\nthen wild applause. The audience rose from their seats,\ncelebrating the man who had created these astonishing images.\nEven Leland Stanford nodded with barely contained enthusiasm.\nSatterthwaite emerged from behind the Black Box, smiling\nbroadly and with satisfaction. \"You have witnessed\ndreams become manifest, the creation of private images to\nbe shared with the public, the birth of true art!\"\nAs he bowed to the ecstatic audience, another shriek echoed\nthrough the night. A woman in a torn red dress stumbled\ntoward the crowd from the back. She rushed through the aisle\ntoward the screen, then fell to her knees, out of breath.\n\"Stop this madman,\" she cried. \"His art is\nborne of betrayal and death!\"\nSatterthwaite remained calm. \"My wife does not approve\nof my art and my scientific innovations,\" he explained.\n\"This has been a strain on our marriage for years.\"\n\"You liar!\" Lucy Satterthwaite rose painfully\nto her feet. \"Explain to these people how your invention\nworks, what is in the Black Box!\"\nSatterthwaite flicked a spot of dust off his collar. \"The\nBlack Box is the secret of my trade, a patented organization\nof electrical circuitry, designed to produce electrical\ncurrents that light up the incandescent lamps in the array\nbehind the screen according to a predetermined pattern.\nI agree that it is exceedingly complex and beyond the ken\nof most men, but it is not at all magical or evil. Years\nof my sweat and blood have poured into this project, nothing\nelse.\"\n\"Your brother's blood, more likely, not your own!\"\nLucy turned to the crowd. \"The Black Box contains nothing\nother than\n\"\nSatterthwaite pulled his wife to the side, covering her\nmouth to muffle her voice. He whispered into her ear: \"I\nshould have shut you up permanently before the performance,\nnot waited until after. But you're too late anyway - you\ncan no longer stop the progress of art and science.\"\nHe turned back to the audience. \"My sincerest apologies\nfor this mishap. My poor wife has been out of sorts for\nquite some time now\n\"\nBut his words were cut off by the sudden droning of the\nBlack Box. The incandescent lamps clicked back on, one by\none, then a new series of images began.\nSatterthwaite, though unable to conceal his surprise completely,\ncontinued his narration: \"Alas, the show goes on! More\ndreams on the Silver Screen are in store for you tonight,\nladies and gentlemen\n\"\nBut the images on the screen were of a different sort than\nbefore. A young woman stood before them, long hair flowing\nonto a long dress, which she very slowly removed. A slightly\nolder man appeared, bearing a resemblance to Archibald Satterthwaite\nhimself, whom she leaned in to kiss.\nThe young rancher in the audience rose to his feet again.\n\"This is too much! It is the product of evil, I tell\nyou! Enough of this indecency!\"\nOne by one, as the images on the screen intensified, audience\nmembers stood up to join the young man in protest. Cries\nof \"pornography!\" and even \"blasphemy!\"\nwere heard, chanted again and again until they drowned out\nthe sounds of the Silver Screen humming.\nEven Archibald Satterthwaite stared at the screen with eyes\nwide, as the images turned into nightmarish exhibitions\nof flesh.\nThe crowd rushed forward. Young men and women tore at the\nSilver Screen, while older ranchers flung stones at the\nincandescent lamps, breaking them in rapid succession. Archibald\nSatterthwaite tried to stop them, but was powerless against\nthe growing masses. The Silver Screen came tumbling down\nin a cascade of silk.\nFinally, the young rancher managed to pry open the Black\nBox itself. He stumbled backward and the blood flushed from\nhis face as he saw what was inside. \"It's\nLord\nhave mercy!\"\nIndeed, inside the Black Box, a human brain floated inside\na pink, viscous fluid, thousands of wires trailing from\nits various swollen bluish-gray lobes to a hole in the side\nof the box, where they exited to connect with the incandescent\nlamps behind the Silver Screen.\nRegaining his composure somewhat, the rancher yanked hard\non the collection of wires, slamming the brain against the\nside of the Black Box and ripping the wires loose of the\nremaining incandescent lamps. The last fragmented images\non the screen came to an abrupt halt.\nThe crowd turned in shock and amazement to the Black Box.\nFinally, the matronly old wife of a minor railroad baron\nasked, \"Where's Satterthwaite?\" The crowd looked\nup in unison, searching for the fiendish inventor. But he\nhad already disappeared into the dark, unpaved streets of\nLos Angeles.\nLucy Satterthwaite stood up, smoothing her ruffled dress\nthe best she could. She walked tentatively toward the Black\nBox, then peered in. Tears welled up in her eyes. \"Here\nhe is, what's left of poor Arnold. Archibald had him killed,\nthen preserved his brain in this nourishing fluid, which\nkept it alive and dreaming. What you saw were images of\nArnold's dreams, telegraphed through the wires from his\nbrain to the array of lamps.\"\nNo one spoke until Leland Stanford raised his voice. \"Did\nyou know this all along?\"\nLucy lowered her eyes. \"I knew Archibald had used a\ndead man's brain to provide images to the Silver Screen.\nBut I didn't know that he had killed anyone. It wasn't until\nthis morning, when Archibald connected the Black Box to\nthe Silver Screen, that I discovered the truth.\"\n\"How did you find out?\"\n\"This morning, I saw the same images you saw tonight\nof the carriage accident that wasn't an accident that killed\nArnold. What you saw was Arnold's nightmare of his death.\"\n\"And the other images?\"\nLucy looked at Stanford. \"Perhaps Arnold's dreams of\nwhat death deprived him of.\"\n* * *\nThe next morning, the rising sun\nof Los Angeles shone down on the ruins of the Silver Screen.\nThe Chinese silk had been ripped to pieces by pillagers,\nthe glass of the incandescent lamps shattered by countless\nboots. The wires lay strewn across the ground, and the Black\nBox had been broken apart.\nIn the hills of her estate in Rancho La Brea, Lucy Satterthwaite\nplaced a small coffin, containing Arnold's brain, in a fresh\ngrave her ranchers had dug that morning. One of them spoke\na short prayer in Spanish, then they covered the grave with\ndirt. Lucy stuck a small cross in the ground, with the inscription:\n\"Arnold Satterthwaite, 1845 - 1881. Artist, father\nof the motion picture.\"\nFive years later, when Lucy Satterthwaite married a wealthy\nnewspaper editor and moved to San Francisco, a prohibitionist\nfrom Kansas named Horace H. Wilcox bought up her estate\nand the ranches surrounding it. His wife, Daeida, renamed\nthe area Hollywood.","source":"http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20051030132526\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/julysept2003\/silverscreen.htm","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/wCYvQtSQOrA43bT5boj1sZ3L2+0.json","volume":4.0,"issues":3.0,"has_text":true}

I know\nvery well that I should, if I wish to learn the truth; but in all honesty I am\ntoo frightened to leave my cabin... Perhaps later, when I've managed to calm my\nnerves and order my thoughts. First I will set down the events of the voyage so\nfar, try to make some sense of the situation. Then and only then will I leave\nthe cabin and stare into the night sky, and learn the terrible truth.\nThree\ndays ago I boarded the liner at Singapore, bound for Southampton. I made the\nacquaintance of Benjamin J. Cadwallader at breakfast in the dining room on the\nfirst full day of the voyage. A tall man of middle years, he entered the room\nand took the table next to mine. He held himself in a stiff manner that\nsuggested illness, and carried under his arm, as a pastor might carry a book of\npsalms, a familiar volume on the strategy of chess.\nI introduced myself, mentioning that clearly he too was a student of the\nGame. His grey eyes fixed me with a penetrating gaze, studying me in minute\ndetail. Then he shook my hand awkwardly, as if he were unaccustomed to the\ngesture.\n\"Indeed I am,\" he replied, in an accent I could not place.\n\"Do you play?\"\n\"I most certainly do,\" I said.\nHis face was thin, though his brow was broad, and the eyes beneath of a\ngrey and far away aspect I am only now coming to understand.\nMr Cadwallader informed me that he had owned a rubber plantation in\nMalaya, until his retirement one month ago. I did not enquire, but I suspected,\nfrom his frail appearance, that ill-health might have forced his premature\nreturn to the West.\nWe finished breakfast and went our separate ways.\nI saw nothing of Mr Cadwallader for three days, and when I did meet him\nagain he seemed in an even feebler state of health.\nI was taking lunch in the dining room when he entered and seated himself\nat my table with a smile and a few words of greeting. When we had finished our\nrespective meals, his distant eyes met mine. For a second, they took on what I\ncan only describe as a look of speculation.\n\"I wonder, Mr Meredith, if you would do me the honour of consenting\nto a game or two of chess?\"\n\"The pleasure would be mine,\" I said.\n\"If we could stage the contest in my cabin, I would be grateful. My\nhealth, as you might have noticed, is not the best. I have certain medicaments\nwhich I must take at regular intervals.\"\n\"By all means,\" I said, and after coffee we walked to his room.\nHe fumbled with the key in the door, then turned to me on the threshold.\n\"If you will be so kind as to wait outside for just one moment...\" he\nsaid, and without explanation closed the door before me. I heard the key turn in\nthe lock. Then, as if this were not odd enough, I heard from within the cabin\nthe sound of something of great weight being dragged across the floor. A minute\nlater the door opened and Mr Cadwallader appeared, his exertions showing in a\nsheen of sweat that covered his haggard features.\nHis cabin was identical to my own. The connecting door to the\nbed-chamber, I noticed, was closed. Two bulky armchairs faced each other across\na small table. Cadwallader invited me to take a seat and joined me.\nWe arranged our pieces and\nsettled down to do battle. Mr Cadwallader won the first game, and I the second.\nBy the third, his manner seemed abstracted; it was as if he were awaiting a call\nor summons. Even so, he beat me, then sank back into his chair with a look of\nexhaustion. \"Forgive me, but the effort... I must rest. Perhaps we might\nplay again tomorrow?\"\n\"I understand perfectly,\" I said. \"Perhaps in the\nafternoon?\"\n\"I am afraid I will be indisposed at that time. But if you would be\nso kind as to drop by tomorrow evening...\"\nI accepted his invitation, and was opening the door when a curious,\nshrill double-note issued from the direction of his bedroom. I turned, and was\nin time to see Mr Cadwallader hoist himself from his chair and limp to the\nbedroom door, which he closed firmly behind him.\nI spent a good part of the following day in my cabin, and at eight that\nevening left to keep my appointment with Mr Cadwallader.\nI knocked on the door, and then again. I waited a minute, and still there\nwas no reply. It occurred to me that perhaps my friend's health had taken a turn\nfor the worse. I tried the handle, then pushed open the door and stepped inside.\nI found Mr Cadwallader seated in his armchair, apparently asleep. I took one\nstep forward - and revised my opinion. Cadwallader seemed dead, such was his\nimmobility.\nI was about to leave and summons the ship's doctor when Mr Cadwallader\nsuddenly opened his eyes. A smile of recognition warmed his features. He seemed\nto come to life by degrees, like some automaton.\nI mumbled something about finding his door unlocked, but Cadwallader\nwaved aside my explanation.\n\"Meredith,\" he said. \"Please be seated. Would you care for\na drop of brandy?\" He indicated a decanter beside the chessboard.\nI set up the pieces and he poured two good measures. I proposed a toast,\nwishing him well on his visit to the old country.\nWe began a game, which Mr Cadwallader won within twenty moves, and as I\nadmitted defeat he refilled our glasses.\nHe showed no inclination to begin another game. He smiled at me over the\nboard. \"You are a man of liberal views,\" he said. \"Would I be\ncorrect in thinking that I could trust you?\"\nI nodded. \"You would,\" I said.\nHe began to ask many questions, and while I answered them he seemed to\npay little regard to the actual answers. His grey eyes stared at me - through\nme; seeing me but at the same time, I felt, inspecting my soul.\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"Yes, as I suspected...\"\n\"You suspected what?\" I asked.\n\"From the beginning,\" Cadwallader said, \"I knew you were\nthe man I was seeking.\"\n\"Seeking?\" I repeated.\n\"Mr Meredith,\" he said, regarding me intensely, \"would it\nsurprise you to learn that that this planet is not alone in harbouring\nintelligent life?\"\nI lowered my glass, quite shocked. I managed: \"To be perfectly\nhonest I cannot recall ever giving the matter much consideration.\"\n\"I am under strict instructions from my Commanding Officer not to\nbreathe a word of my mission to any native of this planet. My present\ncircumstances, however, force me to disobey that order.\"\nI stared at him. \"Your Commanding Officer? Your... mission?\"\n\"I am from the planet Thallia, of the star known to you as Bellatrix,\nand I am here in my capacity as an engineer-\"\n\"An engineer?\"\n\"An engineer of Temporal Alignment.\"\nI shook my head. \"Temporal Alignment...? I'm afraid I...\" My\nhead was spinning, and the brandy was not accountable.\nHis thin smile hyphenated his sallow cheeks, and I was aware that, for\nthe moment, his illness seemed to recede.\n\"Perhaps I had better begin at the beginning.\"\n\"Perhaps you had,\" I agreed.\nHe regarded me above his joined finger-tips. \"In three thousand\nyears,\" he began, \"my planet will be the only one boasting intelligent\nlife in the entire galaxy.\"\n\"But what about Earth? Surely in three thousand years...\"\nHe smiled sadly. \"I will come to that presently,\" he informed\nme. \"As I said, we Thallians will then be the only intelligent race in the\ngalaxy. The chances of two sentient races existing at the same time in the same\ngalaxy are astronomical - billions to one. My race, at the peak of its\ntechnological development, finds itself alone. Can you conceive of that, Mr\nMeredith? No, I rather think you cannot. We have developed sciences that would\nseem to you like magic; yet we had no one with whom to share this great store of\nknowledge. We had the means to help planets, civilisations, through potentially\ncatastrophic periods of their history - yet no planetary civilisations\nco-existed with our own.\"\nHe paused, his eyes glazed as if contemplating some far distant future\ntime. Presently he continued: \"Throughout the galaxy we sent survey ships,\nsearching for intelligent life. Alas, they found only the remains of life, races\ndevolved into barbarism, civilisations that had destroyed themselves through\ngreedy power struggles. Then, our scientists made a remarkable breakthrough:\nthey discovered the secret of time travel. More, they also learnt how to bring\ninto alignment with our own time those planets which we had found in ruination -\nbut at a period of those planets' histories when they were bursting\nwith life and intelligence!\"\nHe sipped his brandy, giving me time to digest this information.\n\"But,\" I said, \"how is it that you can 'align' these\ncivilisations which your survey ships locate in ruins? There is a paradox here,\nif I rightly understand the matter. Surely the very fact that your ships locate\na planet in ruination suggests that you do not 'align' that planet?\"\n\"That is astute of you,\" he said. \"There is certainly a\nparadox, though this is easily explained.\"\nHe sat back, clasped his hands before his chest, and continued. \"It\nis the duty of a Temporal Engineer to set up a rift in the space-time continuum\naround the subject planet. This has the effect of opening two separate\ntime-streams, so that, literally, time will fork. There will be a planet which\nwill find itself in the 'future', co-existent with Thallia, and we will then\nhelp the planet through its time of crisis; and there will be a planet which\ncontinues on its downward path to ruination and extinction.\"\n\"But how is this... this space-time rift brought about?\"\nI asked impatiently.\n\"First,\" Cadwallader replied, \"the planet's nodal point\nmust be located; this is the only locus on the subject planet at which the rift\ncan be effected - the planet's chronic weak spot, if you like.\"\n\"And then?\"\n\"And then the apparatus known as the Temporal Equalizer comes into\nplay.\"\n\"The device you have set up in your bedroom?\" I ventured, the\nfull implications of Cadwallader's mission becoming apparent to me.\n\"You...\" I said, \"you intend to align Earth?\"\n\"As a Temporal Engineer it is my duty to bring Earth 'up to date' as\nwe joke.\"\n\"But - but this suggests that in time the Earth will be no\nmore!\"\nHe inclined his head. \"In one time-stream, this is so.\"\n\"But how can humankind possibly bring ruination upon the Earth? This\nis preposterous!\"\nAgain that thin, wintery smile occurred on his haggard face. \"In a\nlittle over one hundred and fifty years, Mr Meredith, humankind will have\ndestroyed itself - in one time-line it has already happened, through conflicts\nutilising germ warfare and chemical poisons. These evils will eradicate not only\nhumankind from the face of the Earth, but every other form of life as well. We\nwish to align the Earth and guide you through this time of crisis, for humankind\nhas the potential for genius as well as a penchant for self-destruction.\"\nHis smile was benign, and I felt like a child before him.\nI shook my head. \"I find this hard to believe.\"\n\"Perhaps if you were present at the time of the alignment...\"\nI looked up. \"This will be performed in England?\"\n\"I have every reason to believe that the Earth's nodal point is\nsituated in the Indian ocean.\"\n\"And you will effect the rift in transit?\"\n\"As to whether I will effect the rift...\" He smiled at me.\n\"I began this exchange by placing my trust in you. I have told you a tale\nthat could, if you cared to broadcast it, have me certified as a lunatic -\ncertainly I have courted your incredulity. I have not, I must add, told you this\ntale for the good of my health-\" and here he gave a snort of laughter.\n\"In short, I need your help - indeed your planet needs your help. I have a\nvery short time left in which to live; I have contracted some Earthly virus that\nis rapidly killing me. In all probability I will be dead in little over a\nday.\"\nHe stared at me, his face expressionless.\n\"What can I do-?\" I began.\nA sound like a sigh of relief escaped his perished lips. \"For the\ntime being, nothing. But, if you would be so kind as to meet me in this cabin at\nfive o'clock tomorrow evening, I will acquaint you with your duty. Until\nthen...\" Unable to rise from his armchair, he lifted his hand in dismissal.\nI passed a sleepless night, my head full of Mr Cadwallader's fantastic\ntale. I awoke early and spent the remainder of the day pacing the deck.\nIt came to me that the mysterious Mr Cadwallader was nothing more than a\nscribbler of the genre known as 'Science Fiction'. He had got into his head the\nfantastic plot for his next story, and had tried it out on me. That was it! No\ndoubt, when five o'clock arrived, Mr Cadwallader would be all smiles and\napologies as he explained to me his magnificent practical joke.\nAfter a bite of afternoon tea, I took myself to his cabin and rapped upon\nthe door. Again I received no reply; again, I took it upon myself to open the\ndoor.\n\"Cadwallader,\" I called heartily as I crossed the threshold.\n\"Your game is up!\"\nMy voice dried in my throat and I stopped dead as, from beyond the open\ndoor of the bedroom, I saw an eerie white light. It pulsed in a regular rhythm\nand fitfully illuminated the gloom of the cabin. It was by this light that I\nmade out Mr Cadwallader.\nHe was sprawled upon a chaise longue at the far end of the room,\nand on seeing him like this I recalled his pronouncement of yesterday: that he\nmight be dead in little over a day. In the event, it appeared that he had not\nlasted even that long. Cautiously, I crossed the room and stood over his\nlifeless body, conscious of the flashing apparatus in the bedroom to my right. I\nknelt and felt for Cadwallader's pulse. His neck was clammy to the touch, the\nskin soft and loose. I had ascertained that there was no pulse when, to my\nhorror, his flesh beneath my fingers began to sag. I jumped to my feet with a\ncry. As I watched, the length of his body subsided, deflated, and, as it did so,\nthe face took on a puckered and warped expression. Only then did I notice the\ngreat rent in the writhing thing before me, an aperture in the epidermis that\nbegan at the chin and terminated at the abdomen. As the erstwhile Cadwallader\nshrivelled, the rent opened further to reveal a dark cavity within. I cried\naloud again and backed off.\nI was about to flee from the room when I heard, from the bedroom, a frail\nvoice call my name. \"Meredith,\" came the croak. \"For the sake of\nhumanity, come here!\"\nI hesitated, then squared my shoulders and plunged into the bedroom.\nThe first thing that caught my attention was the illuminated machine -\nthe Temporal Equalizer, as he had called it. It stood upon a tripod of\nscimitar-shaped legs, silver in colour and ovoid in shape, with a collar about\nits middle from which the opalescent light emanated. A dozen levers bristled\nfrom its upper dome, and a series of buttons decorated its lower hemisphere. It\nstood about three feet high and hummed quietly to itself.\nThen, after taking in this strange machine, I set eyes on the being\nwhich, until now, had passed itself off as Mr Cadwallader.\nIt sat slumped against the wall of the bedroom, a bipedal creature no\nlarger than a five-year-old child. It was green and vaguely frog-like, and the\nstench that rose from it was odious in the extreme. It regarded me with crimson\neyes the size of tennis balls.\n\"Meredith!\" it gasped through a slit of a mouth. \"Pull\nyourself together!\"\nI realised then that I was\nmoaning to myself. I gestured to the sloughed skin in the outer room.\n\"You... you...?\"\n\"Of course!\" it said impatiently. \"Surely you realise that\nwe Thallians could not resemble humans. 'Cadwallader' was a necessary disguise.\nMy apologies for alarming you - but such was my fever I could no longer bear to\nbe so confined... Enough of this! We rapidly approach the nodal point - the time\nof division is upon us. Listen carefully, Meredith, and do exactly as I\nsay.\" He seemed to gather a deep breath, as if he were in great pain.\n\"First, position yourself before the machine. Quickly, man!\"\nPart of me wanted to do nothing but run from the room and never return;\nbut some other, eminently sensible part, held fast and obeyed the incapacitated\nThallian.\n\"When the time arrives,\" he gasped, \"take hold of the two\nlongest levers and draw them towards you.\"\n\"But how will I know when?\" I cried.\n\"It will be obvious! Once this is done, depress the seven green\nstuds on the central collar, one by one with intervals of a second in between.\nThen return the levers to their original positions.\"\nI grasped the levers in anticipation, my heart labouring. The frequency\nof the opalescent flashes accelerated, and with it the beat of my heart. On the\nfloor, the alien took great breaths and regarded me through half-closed eyes.\nThere was a flash of lightning from outside, and the ship seemed to\njudder along its course as if buffeted by a mighty wave. Thunder clapped and the\nalien called: \"Now, Meredith! Pull the levers now!\"\nWith an involuntary cry I took a firmer grip on the rods and drew them\ntowards me, and as I did so I realised why the alien required my assistance. The\nlevers were stubborn; I had almost to hang onto them with all my weight in order\nto pull them into position. It was as if I were wrestling with the very spirit\nof the storm. As the levers came to rest, the air was instantly charged with a\nlow, electric hum; outside, lightning flickered again. I depressed the green\nstuds on the collar of the machine at the prescribed one second intervals, and\nit was as if each button controlled the stability of the climate outside. As the\nstuds disappeared into the flashing light, the severity of the storm increased;\nthe thunder pealed ever louder and the lightning became nigh continuous.\n\"Now return the levers to their original positions!\" the alien\ncried above the din of the storm.\nThis I did, but, if I expected the storm to cease then, I was\ndisappointed. The turmoil continued unabated. Added to which, the entire ship\nwas bathed in the eerie translucent glow, similar to that which emanated from\nthe machine, and a high-pitched drone set my nerves on edge.\n\"Meredith,\" the alien called, \"your work is almost over.\nThe alignment is complete. All that remains is for you to do away with the\nevidence of my interference.\"\n\"In what way?\" I shouted back.\n\"First, take the machine from the cabin, along with the Cadwallader\nsuit, and throw them overboard. Hurry, and make sure you are unobserved!\"\nI did as he commanded. As the ship rolled from side to side, I hauled the\ndevice from the bedroom and across the floor of his cabin. I first ensured that\nthe deck outside was deserted, and then dragged the contraption the rest of the\nway. I paused by the rail and took a grip on the midriff of the machine, hoisted\nit with all my strength and rolled it over the rail. I let go and watched it\nspin, still flashing and buzzing, down into the wind-whipped ocean. Then I went\nback for the rubber Cadwallader suit and, rather gingerly, carried the flaccid\nobject to the side and dropped it overboard.\nI returned to the bedroom, lighted now only by the flicker of lightning,\nand made out the small shape of the alien in the intermittent illumination.\n\"Help me to my feet!\" he demanded.\nAccustomed as I was to obeying his orders, I helped him upright. At the\ncold touch of his skin on mine, I shuddered with revulsion.\n\"Where to?\" I cried.\nHe gestured feebly to the deck, and as we staggered from the cabin the\nsteamer pitched and rolled in the storm. \"And now?\"\nHe fell against the rail and attempted to clamber overboard. I restrained\nhim. \"Are you insane!\" I cried.\n\"I cannot be found on the Earth that remains in the past,\" he\nsaid. \"And anyway, I am as good as dead already. Please, let me go!\"\nBy now he had climbed upon the rail, and was balancing on the top-most\nbar. He turned his great crimson eyes on me. \"Thank you, Meredith,\" he\nsaid, pulling his arm from my grip.\n\"But I must know,\" I cried, \"which Earth is this one?\"\nHe regarded me for what seemed like ages, then said: \"I am afraid I\ncannot tell, Meredith. Only time will give you the answer.\"\nAnd with that he released his grip on the rail and slipped overboard.\nWith a cry of desperation I dashed forward, as if released from bonds, and\nstared after him. I beheld a quick glimpse of my friend's storm-tossed body\nbefore the ocean of Earth claimed him for ever.\nAs\nI sit here and finish this account, I am a man in the grip of fear. I alone, of\nall humanity, am aware of the cataclysmic change through which the planet passed\nthis evening. I alone know that there exists, in time, two planet Earths - and\ntwo versions of myself! - and that one planet is doomed and the other destined\nto be saved by the intervention of an alien race.\nThe 'I' who writes this account might exist on the Earth doomed to\nself-destruction - or on the Earth destined to be saved by the Thallians.\nThere is, of course, one way I can find out for certain.\nOh, God, give me strength to leave the cabin and look into the night sky,\nto look upon unfamiliar constellations and know that it is my\nplanet that has been saved...","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050421121801\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/octdec2001\/thallian.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The Internet's Premier Magazine of Historical Science Fiction","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/I3tZ3T9DLZHLQGr2AQeI+zfJPZg.json","volume":2.0,"issues":3.0,"has_text":true}

This made it difficult to\nconvey the significance of what had happened to him that night. He only knew\nthat in that instant, through that vision, he gained the understanding to become\nwhat he was. He spoke of it as his \u201cmanifest destiny, a path laid out by\nProvidence, which he followed with the instinctive sureness of a sleepwalker\u201d.\nBy now nobody dared show that they did not understand or at least believe. They\nstood around either in rapt wonder or abject fear and listened as he repeated\nthe story again. Occasionally their minds would wander but never to far. Those\nin the inner sanctum could repeat the story in their sleep though none dared\neven joke about it in the privacy of their own home and their few who had been\nthere from the very beginning.\nIt was a cold and miserable winter with the effects of the recent conflagration still clearly etched in the drawn faces and hollow eyes stares of the people milling around on the once gay streets. His coat was several sizes to big and hung off his shoulders forcing him to role the sleeves up. He stared angrily at the scene of daily struggle being played out in front of him, shook his head and rubbed his eyes that now always itched on really bright days. He tried to pull his coat tighter but the belt was already at its narrowest. His boots were the same ones he had worn this time last year and they looked it. He could feel his own ribs against his elbows. In his pocket the notebook pressed against his hand, reminding him that he needed to hurry if he were to get the job done properly. It was a job that he had been hurriedly trained for, someone in the organisation had decided he had the right sort of temperament for it and he had been in no position to turn the offer down. This particular assignment would, the man was sure, be also be a waste of time. Just as the previous ones had been a waste of time. Still, there was always a risk involved despite his training and although he was considered a brave man, he approached these assignments with some trepidation.\nWhen he told it now though, he chose not to remember his doubts and worries for that was not the true significance behind the events of that day. Still, he enjoyed setting the scene for it made them all realise how far he and indeed they all had come in such a short time. After all, one can only compare your achievements if you have something to compare it with. Only people who remembered their past would drive themselves forward with the energy and urgency needed to secure their place.\nThere was no need to look as he crossed the street because few cars and trams were running in these fuel-rationed days. He would forget it later but he also wanted to avoid the unsavoury bunch of thugs gathered on the corner, using a metal pole to persuade some poor fellow to see their point of view. He consoled himself as he hurried down the short flight of stairs that if he weren\u2019t undercover he would have rushed to the man\u2019s aid. The concrete steps were filthy and a fresh pool of vomit gave an indication to the type of clientele that trod on them. It was not an unfamiliar sight and he barely gave it a second glance. He had smelled and seen far worse.\nThe men gathered around him now in that austere marble room smiled when he recounted what the town had looked like. They were not distant memories for some of them and others had long ago discovered it was better not to say where they had been at that time. One of the men began to ask a question but the green-grey eyes seemed to physically drive the question back down his throat until it appeared as though he were going to gag on his own voice. The would-be questioner fumbled to a halt and stared at the ground. Those who had been day dreaming and dozing snapped back to attention, lest those green eyes mark them out.\nWhen he pushed back the thick wooden door his hand was covered in a fine film of dirt and grease. He walked into the low ceiling room and did a quick scan of the surrounds. A fire was roaring in the grate but the landlord was obviously burning anything he could get his hands on. A thick, grey smoke hung in the dense, vapid air and his eyes were soon smarting. There was only a handful of people and most sat alone at a mismatch of wooden benches, tables and stools. Some looked as though they had been nursing the same drink for most of the day or maybe even longer. He went over and spoke quietly to the Landlord who pointed him in the direction of a thick panelled oak door, partly obscured in the far corner of the room. He picked up his beer and slunk towards the door. He didn\u2019t knock, that would certainly have given the game away, but he pushed the door very gently and slipped quickly through the gap.\n\u201cI am not a religious man,\u201d he said thumping the richly panelled wooden desk, his immaculately tailored grey sleeve riding up to reveal a thin wrist covered in dark hair. He was not wearing a watch. Those around him nodded although some kept as still as possible. \u201cBut that was a moment of great truth, of a greater force guiding me and leading me there. Do you know the incredible burden, the strain I have been under since that day? Can you really comprehend my struggle?\u201d He lent back and surveyed the nodding heads that surrounded him. A dramatic sigh escaped from his lips and his shoulders seemed to sag under some physical weight. \u201cDo you have any concept of what it is like to be shown the way that you have to go, what you have to do for the rest of your life? To have so many depending on you?\u201d As so often happened when he began a speech, flecks of spittle gathered at the sides of his mouth before launching themselves like angry hornets in all directions. The words seemed to hang in the air long after he had stopped talking and even for that brief moment there were those who found themselves totally absorbed in the rhythmic cadence of his words. Their hearts seemed to beat in time with the rise of his voice and they could feel the urgency of his message. None of those who felt the flecks of spittle hit their faces made any move to wipe them away.\nHe closed the greasy door quietly behind him and slipped into a chair near the back where he could comfortably observe the surrounds. This room was even warmer than the other was. A smaller, cleaner fire and the press of twenty or so people in the small place meant it had become very stuffy. Several people looked up at him when he entered, some of them openly hostile but most simply curious. They were all listening, or feigning interest in a middle-aged man who was telling of his plan to save them. It became obvious very quickly that this was not a group to worry about. He got his notebook out as surreptitiously as possible and began to look at those around him. He did not recognise any of them from the files back at HQ but they could so easily have been any one of those. They were young and old men, either unemployed or held menial jobs, recently discharged, bored and waiting for something to happen who were gathered on every street corner in every town. He knew their profile so well by now and it was only the fact that he could so easily be one of them that prevented him from chucking his job in. If he could only make money from his real profession, his true talent then he would not have been sitting in this dark and dingy cellar, he thought. Now was not the time for artists to flourish, no matter how talented.\nThis part of the tale never varied, no matter how many times he retold and whomever he told it too. It was this that made some of them wonder if it were not really true. Although most got tired of hearing the whole story repeated over and over again, they all got a buzz out of this part. The portly man sitting on his left, who would need to watch his diet in the future, always took a special pleasure in this part of the tale as though he had some personal role to play in it. The way his voice dropped every time to a hoarse almost fearful whisper and the look of sheer amazement that swept across his face gripped them all and turned even the most skeptical into believers.\nAs he sat in that dank cellar and listened he began to daydream of himself in one of those flying machines. Without any effort his hand began to scrawl frantically across the page. He felt as though he were looking down at his hand from a flying machine but the hand was no longer his own. It was that of a giant, standing far below. The giant was desperately writing a message in the rich soil and it was intended only for him. The giant was Herodotus he quickly realised although how he knew this he was not sure. He looked down on the page but all he could make out was a scrawl of messy black ink. He breathed in the smell of smoke, stale beer, the sweat of men and the dampness of his surrounds. He could feel the solid pine bench beneath him and the scarred and pitted table that had born the brunt of many a pay cheque. He realised with a start that he had not heard a word the man had said and the man was now fielding questions from the floor. He looked again at the writing on the page and to his wonder he saw it clearly. He read it and he was afraid.\n\u201cOf course, there are many who would like to be me or at least to be in my position,\u201d he exclaimed to the men sitting entranced around him. A thin smile played at the edges of his mouth but was not reflected in the bottomless pool that was his eyes. Those who caught his stare shook their heads in vigorous denial and some felt obliged to even murmur aloud that nothing could be farther from the truth. His whole body shook with the fervour of his conviction and belief as he continued. So engrossed were those surrounding him that they were swept up in the wave of his righteous indignation. The small man sitting to his right no longer felt the ever present polio induced ache in his leg while the short man standing behind him squinted through his glasses forgetting that he was once a simple pig farmer. The round-headed man in a smart grey civilian suit was filled with energy despite only recently flying in from intense negotiations with the Russians. The energy around the table was palpable and seemed to have affected them all\n\u201cI knew what I was being told,\u201d the man continued, \u201cBut I could not believe it was happening there and then. Amazing that it would work in such mysterious ways,\u201d he paused, shaking his head because it still astounded him. \u201cBut when I was certain that I had been called and I alone seemed to be given the knowledge to know what was best for all of us, as I have shown time and time again, I did not hesitate!\u201d The final phrase was delivered from the edge of his seat and with a resounding thump as he slammed both palms onto his desk challenging anyone to disagree. No one met his gaze this time.\nHe slammed his glass down and stood up. The man who had been in the middle of his question stopped, obviously not used to such interruptions, and stared at the late arrival who was now moving to the front of the room. Those who had been dozing off sensed the sudden change in the room and sat up. The two bull-necked thugs at the door looked to the speaker for guidance but his eyes were fixed on the scruffy looking man who was moving purposefully towards the stage. He stared around the room from his new vantage point. He still had no idea what exactly he was going to say but it was too late now. The vision he\u2019d had was too strong to ignore, the feelings it aroused in him were so positive and he knew that he had a message that would bring these people the salvation that they were looking for. He had arrived at a turning point in his life and as they would soon discover so had they. He could walk away or let the thugs carry him away and then tomorrow would be no different than today. Or he could use this moment, while they were still stunned and deliver his vision and promise for the future. Before the speaker could react and in a voice that amazed no one more than himself he began to speak.\nThis\nwas where the man normally ended the tale and those who had heard it several\ntimes knew there would be no more. The man himself never intimated that the hand\nhad written more, a lot more in fact. It had written of a time that would not\nplease these men, of a time when they would not be as smug or as comfortable.\nYet how could he not follow the vision, how could he not do what history had\nclearly ordained and chosen him to do? Even knowing the end result could not\nprevent one from making their mark in world history. History was stronger than\nany force that man could unleash and it was History that had revealed itself to\nhim that night. There were moments now were even he sometimes believed that he\ncould rewrite history but in retelling the story he was reminded all over again\nthat man is no more than the pawn on the chessboard of world history.\nThe\nknock on the door startled all of them around the table and they swung around to\nstare at the foolish person who had dared to interrupt them. The messenger was\nyoung and clearly very nervous, his delivery of the standard greeting not as\npolished and assured, as he would have liked. The man stared at him from behind\nthe desk; the look moving menacingly down the aisle created by the men who had\nall turned to stare.\n\u201cMein Fuhrer,\u201d the young man\u2019s voice rose a scale or two as he stood with his right arm still pointing stiffly towards the ceiling, \u201cHerr Chamberlain\u2019s plane has just landed at the airport.\u201d","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050903212707\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/janmar2001\/struggle.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The Internet's Premier Magazine of Historical Science Fiction","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/SRqvrHvZZnz560ThjShjSb25DyM.json","volume":2.0,"issues":1.0,"has_text":true}

He feared that he could fall, as the wood was rotting and the catwalks were rusted. His shoulders ached, as the factory was far from simple work, and the contraption on his back, cobbled together from pure rubbish compounded his pain.\nHe\ntook in a whiff of the night air, and glanced back to make certain that Molly\nwas still asleep. Like an angel. She had said that he was brilliant, and also that his quest\ntonight was naive and dangerous. He\nloved her for her sense. He had\nexperienced no problems with sense. He\nran his hands once more around the apparatus he wore; he knew it was fine, but\nnervousness was affecting him.\n\u201cWell,\nit worked yesterday,\u201d he murmured, \u201cI just need to perfect my landings.\u201d\nLooking\nup toward the sky, he saw another of the greenish lights that had appeared\nperiodically for the last few months. Taking\nthis as a sign of good fortune, he leaned himself forward, nearly falling off\nthe building, and activated his machine. In\na blast of noiseless steam, he was off. He\nlaughed and roared in triumph as he climbed in height, above the buildings of\nNew York.\nIt\nhad been five years since he stepped onto the streets, and he was amazed by the\nprogress that had been made. From\nsuch a height, the city had an unnatural beauty, the tall buildings still being\nconstructed, and the heavy rustle of carriages below, the dots of flickering\nlight along the streets. For a\nsecond, he was afraid he would fall, that his invention would fail him.\nBut such a glorious death! Far\nbetter than lying down on a country road, mouth stuffed with grass, like his\nfather. Gliding smoothly at such\nheights would inspire anyone. Ryan\nwas already inspired, though.\nIn\nthe city, there were screens on which you could watch other people.\nThey were colorless, and never spoke, but were real nonetheless.\nEveryone loved the living photographs, Ryan top among them.\nThere were no strictly Irish or Italian pictures; they had no nationality\nof their own. Men and women from\nall over the city would stand in line to watch, to observe, to study.\nAnd then they began to change. Scenes\nof sneezing, of boxing, of natural life were replaced with\u2026 active life.\nScenes that told you something, which told a story.\nStories of great deeds and fantastic adventure.\nThey were unlike any book you could read; they unfolded before you.\nAnd Ryan found himself falling into a rapture, having seen these\nwonderful pictures, and when he woke, his mind was full of ideas.\nIt was then that he began his project, which took not nearly as long as\nhe had imagined.\n\u201cI\u2019ll\nhave to make some sort of protection for my eyes,\u201d Ryan mused as he squinted. The wind was drying them very badly, but he was almost at his\ndestination. He had decided that\nthere would be no better place to visit than the home of one Mr. Caranati, the\nman who photographed the images that so inspired Ryan. The house was well known, Caranati was the only one who lived\nthere; he was a boss, a controller of police and roughnecks alike, among the\nrichest men in the town\u2019s Italian section.\nThus, the benefits of Ryan\u2019s unorthodox visit were twofold: first, he\nwould demonstrate how he had been inspired (and perhaps inspire Caranati\nhimself!), and secondly, he would not be attacked by ruffians (inevitable for a\nMick in this part of town). He\nsupposed that he was a dreamer, a little boy pursuing an idol.\nBut he cared not.\nFinally spying his target (barely), Ryan settled down on the windowsill. A perfect landing. \u201cSurely a man as inspired as Mr. Caranati will appreciate my visit,\u201d he thought, \u201cand besides, I can always fly off if anything goes wrong.\u201d Ryan\u2019s eyes slowly recovered from the flight, and he noticed something curious. There was an odd light coming from the window. \u201cPerhaps he\u2019s burning a gas lantern\u2026\u201d Ryan mused as he slowly eased himself in.\nThe\nlight was intense inside the room, and greener than anything he had seen before\nin his life. And then he saw why,\nfor the light was emanating from a great shape in the room.\nRyan stepped forward, and the shape lunged back.\nIt was like a tree trunk, but writhing, with great tendrils spread out\naround the room. Ryan had no time\nto think before he heard a click behind him.\nHe spun around and saw Caranati standing before him, pointing a revolver\nat his head. This was not what\ninterested Ryan the most, though. It\nwas the fact that Caranati wore nothing but the tendrils of the glowing beast,\nwhich rubbed him almost playfully, with tenderness.\n\u201cMy\nGod,\u201d gasped Ryan, \u201cWas this where the lights in the sky came from?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re\nvery inquisitive,\u201d said Caranati, his voice heavy, almost weary.\n\u201cHow did you get here? What\nis that thing on your back? Are\u2026\nare you here to blackmail me?\u201d\nCaranati\nwas struggling with his words, and he seemed to barely see Ryan.\nHe stared into space for a moment, and his eyes crossed. Ryan said to him, \u201cMr. Caranati, I\u2019m sorry to\u2026\ninterrupt, but I wanted to show you what I had made.\nIt\u2019s a flying machine, sir. Your\npictures inspired me\u2026\u201d\n\u201cInspiration,\u201d\nhissed Caranati, a grin widening on his face, \u201cYes, inspiration.\nIt\u2019s what I know best\u2026 I\u2026 I met this friend of mine a while back,\nfell right from the sky. It\u2026\nshe\u2026 she is my muse. She gives me\nthe finest images, the greatest visions\u2026 and asks for so little in\nreturn\u2026\u201d\nHe\ngasped, and his vision went out once again.\nRyan approached Caranati, to help him, to try and understand, but a\ntendril, a whip of light, struck him and sent him straight out the window.\nCaranati did not notice; he had dropped the gun and was grinning like a\nmadman as the visions overtook him.\nRyan\nactivated his device as he fell, and began to spin wildly, out of control.\nHe landed on his back, and his invention absorbed much of the impact; the\nforce of his landing turned it off. Ryan\nstood, unbelieving of what he had just seen, and unbelieving that his face had\nnot been dashed clean off by his landing. He\nshook uncontrollably for a minute, and then stared up to the house.\nThe light was still shining. He\nclosed his eyes for a moment, regained his composure, and smiled a bit.\n\u201cWell,\u201d\nhe whispered, \u201cEvery innovator has his own way.\nWe\u2019re the same, really. Just\nin different ways\u2026\u201d\nHe\nactivated his invention once more, and was off over the city, as the sun rose.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050903212707\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/janmar2001\/inspiration.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The Internet's Premier Magazine of Historical Science Fiction","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/ReOpB4ch2uV0Ju3UC0wsLlRQG5Q.json","volume":2.0,"issues":1.0,"has_text":true}

The\nold rebel flag had always been a symbol to him, a representation\nof defiance that he never could shake from his body...even\nwhen it had cost him his one chance at a decent education.\nBut it was more than that, it was a clinging to a series of\ncauses and effects that never made much sense to him...he'd\nslept through most of his history classes. But on a hot Georgian\nday, it was hard to concentrate on lessons of the past...now\nall he could do is wish he had.\nThe young corporal eyed Jeffrey with obvious caution. Not\nthat he thought the newcomer was a Yank, his lack of the northern\ntwang was clear about that, but it was obvious he still didn't\nbelong.\n\"Where ya from?\" the soldier finally asked, forced\ninto conversation by the sheer pressure of the silence.\nJeffrey\nglanced away from his motorcycle towards the corporal and\nnarrowed his brow in an almost annoyance. It wasn't that he\nthought he was hallucinating...he'd taken enough mind altering\nsubstances in the past to know what that felt like, but if\nthis was reality, why did it have to talk to him? Finally\nhe turned back towards the front of the large canvas tent\nhe was in, and stared out the open flaps at his Harley...roped\nto a thick wooden stake.\n\"Outside\nMarietta,\" he finally consented, never taking his gaze\nfrom his one link to sanity.\n\"That's a nice place,\" the corporal said, pleased\nwith the response. \"I'm from Georgia myself...Atlanta.\nReally nice place before the war.\"\nJeffrey\nfidgeted for a moment on the hard wooden chair, then began\nto stand up. Instantly the corporal lost his youthful grin\nand leveled his rifle at him. \"I wouldn't do that if\nI were you, mister.\"\nFor an instant, Jeffrey wondered if the soldier would really\nfire...hell...he barely looked old enough to shave. But then\nthree officers entered the tent, breaking the situation.\n\"What's the meaning of this corporal?\" the eldest\ndemanded as he took the wide brimmed hat off his closely cropped\nhair.\n\"Nothin'\nsir,\" the youth quickly stammered out, while lowering\nhis weapon. \"The prisoner was trying to get up.\"\n\"I\nwas just stretching,\" Jeffrey protested, eyeing the gun,\nand the shaking hands that held it nervously. \"Why am\nI being held here.\"\n\"You're\nbeing held,\" the Colonel informed him sternly, \"because\nyou appeared in our camp without warning, on that wheeled\nmachine.\" He gestured towards the Harley.\n\"Is that a crime?\" Jeffrey asked, a hint of his\nexasperation coming through.\n\"Perhaps,\"\nthe Colonel snapped back. \"I would probably sleep better\ntonight if we just shot you now.\"\n\"He\nsaid he's from Georgia,\" the Corporal spoke up, as if\nsuddenly on the newcomer's side.\n\"Did the Colonel ask for your aid, soldier?\" the\nCaptain to the right of the commander hissed.\nThe Corporal shook his head wildly, while taking another step\nback.\n\"Then I advise y'all to keep it shut.\"\nSuddenly\nthe friction was shattered by the furious pounding of a horse\nat full run, as it pulled up to the tent, men shouting after\nit as it came to a sudden halt. The three officers sped quickly\nout to see what had happened, cautiously followed by the Corporal\nand his prisoner.\nA\nconfederate soldier half collapsed as he slid off his horse,\ncaked and dried blood covering half his right leg. He quickly\nscanned the crowd, focusing on the company's commanding officer.\nThen he pulled out a crumpled and sealed letter, and offered\nit to the Colonel.\nThe\ncommander stared at the messenger for a moment, reading the\nintensity of the ride that had just taken place in his eyes,\nthen took the letter and looked it over.\nThe\nsheer size of the camp struck Jeffrey as he stepped out of\nthe tent for the first time, and he realized that the force\nof men here must have numbered over ten thousand. Then he\ngazed at the messenger, a man in obvious agony, who refused\nto collapse despite the grizzly wound in his leg that Jeffrey\ndoubted that current medicine could save.\nBut\nthat wasn't what transfixed him in silence, as his eyes focused\non the steady glare of the messenger, who only stared at the\nColonel as if waiting for a reply. It was the sheer determination\nthat the young soldier had as he stood there, his mission\ncompleted...an intensity that Jeffrey had never felt about\nanything, or anyone.\nWords\nlike \"bum\" and \"waste of talent\" were\nwhat had come from his father most of his life, in direct\nresponse to his lack of conviction over anything. But those\nwords had been mild, compared to his father's fury over his\ndecision not to attend Annapolis, even after his forced application\nhad been accepted with flying colors.\nHe\nhad never felt more empty, wanting to want something, hoping\nbeyond hope to actually care how anything turned out. He left\nthe acceptance letter on the dining room table in front of\nhis mortified father, and had gotten on his Harley and just\nridden...and ridden. At first the air disturbance ahead had\ngone unnoticed by him while flying along the highway, appearing\nas nothing more than the ripple of heat waves that came off\nthe hot Georgian highways in mid spring. But then he passed\nthrough it, and the world had fallen out from under him, as\nwaves of nausea had claimed his body before passing out...only\nto wake up in the worst of nightmares.\nIt\nhadn't taken him very long to figure out that he was in the\nmiddle of the Civil War, even when imprisoned in a tent for\nhours...he absently wondered if his Harley had been damaged.\nIt was the intensity in the Colonel's voice that snapped him\nback to this selective version of reality, as he read off\nthe letter that the messenger had half died getting here.\n\"It's from General Lee,\" he announced to the officers\naround him, \"and it's urgent.\"\nThe Colonel looked around to make sure everyone was listening,\nthen continued. \"It seems that his forces are already\nin Pennsylvania, and are converging on Gettysburg. He feels\nthat a victory there is sure to happen against the weaker\nUnion forces, and a Federal surrender will follow shortly.\"\nGrins and smiles spread among the officers as the end of their\nown nightmare finally seemed at hand.\n\"But\nhe feels that our presence there is vital to the success of\nhis campaign,\" the Colonel added quickly.\n\"But\nsir,\" the Corporal spoke up again, forgetting the Captain's\norder. \"What of all those Yanks we saw headn' up towards\nthe Potomac last week. They could be headn' there too...couldn't\nthey?\"\nThe officers were silent for a moment, as the reality of what\nthe young soldier sank home. \"Then Lee could be underestimating\nthe size of the Union forces,\" the Colonel stated, \"since\nhe thought those Yanks were still around here.\" He glared\ndown at the messenger, an urgency filling his voice. \"How\nlong have you been on the road?\"\n\"Three\ndays,\" the messenger said as he tried to stand tall,\nonly to have his leg finally give out from under him.\n\"Get\nhim a doctor,\" the commander ordered his captain. \"And\nfind me your fastest rider. We have to get Lee a warning in\ntime.\"\n\"All\nour horses are exhausted from the week long march we just\nwent through, Colonel,\" the Captain informed him. \"Perhaps\nwe could seize one from the local farmers, but he'd have to\nbe a fast one to get to Pennsylvania in time.\"\n\"I\ncould go,\" came from the voice that no one expected to\nhear from, most of all the person who spoke it.\nThe\nColonel looked over at his prisoner with annoyance and disdain,\ntrusting neither his outlandish dress, or the strange wheeled\ncontraption they had found him with. \"You?\"\nJeffrey looked at the messenger again, as other soldiers helped\nhim back to his feet, then he glanced over at his bike, nodding\nsilently before he even realized he was doing it.\n\"Why should I trust you?\"\nThe\nyouth liked his dry lips tentatively, as if stalling for time.\nThere was no reason he could give, he had always been the\nperson you could trust not to complete anything...but suddenly\nhe had to do this. \"My bike is fast...very fast.\"\nHe read the skepticism in the Colonel's eyes, causing him\nto stand all the more firm. \"I could have a message from\nyou in Lee's hand in under a day.\"\nThe\ncommander's eyebrows raised in wonder as he considered how\nthe machine had roared as it had plummeted into his camp,\nwildly out of control. He doubted any of his men could master\nits control, even if he cared to have one of them try. \"That\ndoesn't explain why I should trust you.\"\nJeffrey started to respond, but nothing came out, and the\nColonel turned back towards his officers.\n\"Let me try...let me do something once in my life that\nmatters.\"\nThe\nColonel turned back to the stranger and stared intently at\nhim, as their eyes locked in a micro-struggle. Then he nodded,\nand wrote quickly on the letter from Lee. His officers started\nto mumble amongst themselves at this turn of events, but when\nthe commander offered the response to Jeffrey, the Captain\nstood forward. \"Sir, ah must object to this!\"\n\"That\nis your prerogative, Captain,\" the Colonel stated flatly,\nas he handed the letter to the prisoner. \"Do you know\nwhere Gettysburg is?\"\nJeffrey\nnodded, remembering the tour he took of the historic battle\nsight when just a kid.\n\"Go with God,\" the Colonel whispered, then patted\nJeffrey on his shoulder. \"Release the machine,\"\nhe commanded the Corporal.\nThe\nyoung soldier quickly had the bike untied and righted, as\nhe walked it over to the new messenger. \"Good luck, sir,\"\nhe said with a grin.\nA\nsmile curled Jeffrey's lips as he read the hope in the young\ncorporal's eyes. Then he stared back at his Harley, and began\nto suddenly care just how bad it had taken the fall. With\na movement that he hoped carried more grace than he felt,\nhe straddled the bike and started it up, whispering a silent\nthanks to God when the engine roared to life.\nThe\nofficers jumped back at the noise, as the Colonel gave him\na nod of approval.\nSlowly he started moving forward, as the waves of gray uniformed\nmen parted before him like the hands of Moses had commanded\nit. Then the camp was far behind him, as the dirt road that\nwould someday become an interstate flew beneath the wheels\nof the motorcycle.\nAs\nthe hours faded away, the memory of the confederate camp and\nthose thousands of troops threatened to become rationalized\ninto a hallucination, but a quick glance at the letter addressed\nto General Robert E. Lee quickly cured that threat each time.\nNever did the ramifications of what he was doing even enter\nhis mind. He knew that the south's defeat at Gettysburg was\nthe turning point that led to a Union victory, and he knew\nthat the information he carried could change that...but all\nthat was in his mind was the task at hand, and the trust of\nthe men he left behind.\nDay\nwas finally surrendering to the night when he passed into\nnorthern territory, and he guessed that Gettysburg was less\nthan a half hour away. His mind raced with the directions\nwritten on the letter, that would lead him to Lee's camp,\nobsessing his thoughts to the point that he didn't see the\nUnion squad until he was almost upon them.\nThe\nthunder clap of musket shots rang in his ears as the danger\nof what his task entailed started to sink home. His instincts\nscreamed for him to turn the bike back, to abandon his mission\nand flee to safety. Instead he became stone, as he paused\nat the top of the hill overlooking the Union soldiers...heedless\nof the whizzing musket balls that passed mere inches from\nhim. Suddenly he knew that this was his moment...all his life\nwas in waiting to charge down this hill, into those guns.\nThere was no question left in his mind as he revved the Harley\ntwice for effect more than anything else, then hit top acceleration\nas he flew into the mouth of the lion.\nThe\nmusket ball that ripped into his shoulder came like a bolt\nof lightning, sending shears of agony along his arm. He almost\nlost control of the bike twice, but managed to stay on as\nhe plowed through the ranks of blue soldiers...then the shot\nstruck his head.\nThe\nHarley flew out from under him as he spiraled back from the\nblow, landing him in a puddle of mud as the soldiers closed\nin. The last thing he remembered was the waves of heat that\nwere rising from the dirt around him, and the unbearable nausea\nthat slipped along with him into oblivion.\nHis eyes opened as the first of the blue uniformed men shook\nhim lightly.\n\"You alive kid?\" he asked as his frame was silhouetted\nby the strobing red lights behind him.\nJeffrey nodded numbly as two more blue suits joined the first.\n\"He just appeared out of nowhere,\" the first of\nthe new arrivals said with wonder. \"I'm amazed we didn't\nhit him.\"\nJeffrey\nsat up slowly, as the police cars came into focus, as did\nthe Pennsylvania state trouper patches that the men wore.\n\"Am I going to live?\" he asked while rubbing his\nprotected head, though he didn't remember putting his helmet\nback on. The ludicrousness of his delusion hit like a ton\nof bricks, as he stood up...feeling the bruises in his shoulder\nand head beginning to develop from the crash.\n\"You\nsure you're OK, kid?\" the first officer asked.\nJeffrey nodded numbly, as a sudden instinct caused him to\nreach into his jacket pocket. For a moment his breath died\nin his throat, as his fingers closed on the cool paper that\nwas folded there. Slowly, almost afraid, he pulled the letter\nout as his eyes strained to read it in the dark. But there\nwas no mistaking the bold letters that turned his world upside\ndown.\n\"To Robert E. Lee, General,\" he whispered almost\nsilently, as the reality of what he just did sank home.\n\"What'd\nyou say, kid?\" the police officer asked.\nFor\na moment Jeffrey said nothing, as an almost foreign sensation\ncrept into his body, and a smile came to his lips. \"I\nsaid I have to get home,\" he replied softly. \"I\nhave an acceptance letter to mail off to Annapolis.\"\n\"You\ngoing to the Naval academy?\" the officer asked, doubt\ncreeping into his eyes as he viewed the dress of the youth...then\nhe reconsidered, as the sudden determination in the kid's\neyes struck like a ringing bell.\n\"Yes,\nI am,\" Jeffrey said as he picked up his Harley from the\nstreet and got back on it, confident that it would start for\nhim. \"But first I have a stop to make at Gettysburg.\"\nThen he revved up his bike, and drove off into the night.\nBack to top","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20051030131543\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/octdec2002\/withoutacause.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/PrNIphXmwxddanjYVvSg2v37-qI.json","volume":3.0,"issues":2.0,"has_text":true}

For in all reality, disease is a constant threat; and no man can be sure that he shall live an extended life beyond 50 years.\nTherefore I intend to give a full and complete accounting of those extraordinary events which have transpired in my life since May 4th, 1804, when my services were secured by Major Alexander Hamilton to serve as his second in a duel with former Vice President Aaron Burr. As a lifelong second in command to the major and having only the highest regard for his character, I reluctantly accepted the duties he warmly pressed upon me.\nAt that time Major Hamilton was 44 years of age in the fullness of good health with both a loyal wife and grown children who cared for him. As I mournfully rowed the major across the rippling Hudson that foggy morning towards the heights of Weehawken on the New Jersey side, I reflected upon the insults the major had hurled at his rival, accusing him of shameful character marred by profligacy and voluptuary tendencies.\n\"Major Hamilton,\" I pleaded, \"would you not allow me to stand in your place against this miscreant.\"\n\"No, Hixon,\" he insisted. \"This business is for me and me alone to carry forward.\"\n\"But, sir,\" I said. \"Should the worst transpire, the world will lose little if I am mortally wounded.\"\nThe major tapped me on the shoulder soothingly. \"Fear not that the worst shall transpire, Captain.\"\nAnd then Major Hamilton became uncharacteristically silent as I continued to row, he only occasionally commenting on the fact that it showed signs of rain. Upon reaching the opposite shore, our boots mournfully crunched up the gravelly slopes to the dueling plain chosen by Burr where we were to engage our opponents who had preceded us there.\nOf the same age as the major, Colonel Burr was far taller and more athletic than the major with surprisingly distinguished features; slender, aristocratic fingers; and rather cold, gray eyes.\nAt once I conferred with my counterpart, Dr. Fortescue--Burr's second, regarding the possibility of last minute reconciliation. However, to my surprise Major Hamilton eschewed his normal gentlemanly conduct, refusing to shake hands with his opponent and saying to me in a voice certain to be heard by Burr and his second, \"In a few minutes this fair nation shall be rid of a despicable cancer. God bless America!\"\nAfter a further brief conference with Dr. Fortescue, I presented the box of dueling pistols. With a sudden disdainful look at his opponent, the major chose first--a gold, engraved, .56 caliber, ivory-handled, Italian Falbution with a nine-inch smooth bore barrel.\n\"I wish you well,\" said Colonel Burr, \"and may God bless he who is in the right this day.\"\nIgnoring Burr's remark, the major simply turned away. Soon the opponents were standing back to back with raised pistols, awaiting the command of Dr. Fortescue. I could not help but observe the trembling of Major Hamilton's hand as he waited; and underneath my breath, I murmured prayers for the salvation of the soul of the loser.\nThen as Doctor Fortescue issued the sharp command to march ten paces, turn, and FIRE, I watched the major resolutely stride, then wheel, lower his pistol, and with his arm still cocked, fire over the head of Colonel Burr. I distinctly remember smelling the smoke and hearing the major's ball crash harmlessly into a hemlock. Then as the smoke cleared, Colonel Burr, in turn, lowered his weapon and taking careful aim fired cleanly into the major's belly.\nMine was then the mournful task of carrying Major Hamilton's body to the dory for burial in Manhattan and to inform his unhappy widow of the outcome of the tragedy.\nSickened by the deadly, corrupt code of outdated chivalry that polluted the behavior of our noblest class, the next day I made it clear to my commanding officer that I desired service far from the urban monstrosities that befouled our great nation.\nThus, on June 6th, 1804, I departed St. Louis for an exploratory voyage, commissioned by President Jefferson, up the length of the Missouri River. Consequently I fell under the command of Colonels Meriwether Lewis and George Rogers Clark.\nThe essential details of that exploration have been made clear by the journals of said officers, and I shall not burden the reader with what is already well known. However, I feel it is my duty to add certain details of that journey that have been excluded from journals from both ignorance and fear of ridicule and to avert public panic.\nHence, I will commence with the events of December 11th, 1805. Having climbed into the lower reaches of a magnificent and as yet nameless range of mountains, we had made camp for the evening in a foot of snow in a location chosen by our Sioux guide. Colonel Lewis had taken to bed early that evening troubled with symptoms of flu and diarrhea while Colonel Clark was indulging his intemperate habit of excess drink.\nIn the meantime I had left the circle of tents and baggage and waded out into the snow in order to relieve myself. The moon covered everything with a brilliant patina of pale green light, and as I went about my business, my heart suddenly froze.\nThe all-white creature that stood on two legs regarding me in the moonlight was at least 12 feet tall and covered from head to foot with thick fur. Its features were definitely human with very dark and deep set, unforgettable eyes.\nBecause I had ventured forth unarmed, I could not kill what stood before me so close that I could see the warm breath emerging from its mouth. All I could do was marvel at the beast which fearlessly regarded me with the curiosity of one who has stumbled upon a visitor from another planet.\nFearing that raising a cry would infuriate or scare off the creature, I overcame my fear and stood motionless. Uncertain what to do as I and the creature maintained a stand-off, I cautiously reached into my jacket pocket and removed a treasured chunk of chocolate I had borne with me all the way from St. Louis and offered it to the beast. As I held the chocolate before me, to my utter amazement, the thing shuffled towards me. It walked with the pigeon-toed, awkward gait of a two-legged bear.\nClumsily taking the chocolate into one hand with what I saw was clearly an opposable thumb, the creature sniffed curiously then devoured the chocolate with evident delight. Then coming yet closer, it cautiously touched my epaulettes which I realized glittered golden in the moonlight.\nThe creature seemed utterly amazed by the shiny glitter of my silver captain's insignia as it slowly traced the outline of the metal with a hairy white finger the thickness of a Cuban cigar. Despite my utter terror, I had the impression that the beast was of friendly intent, but subsequent events denied me the opportunity to test the proposition.\nAt that moment it chanced to happen that one of our perimeter guards had marched in our direction and seen the encounter between the beast and me. Assuming that I was in mortal danger, the guard fired several shots. The musket balls sent my \"friend\" scrambling up the mountain face howling with pain.\nThe next morning neither the testimony of the sentry, nor the tracks of the beast, nor the blood stains, nor my own account could sway Colonel Clark who insisted I'd been drinking and had merely encountered a large bear.\nAlthough I knew as well as I breathed that what I had dealt with was no two-legged bear, I did not trouble to argue with the colonel. However, to be candid, it is my belief that the American West remains populated with undiscovered humans of variant types of ancient origins, specifically--in my opinion--what I encountered in the moonlight was one of the lost tribes of Israel, for as the Old Testament instructs us, \"There were giants in the land in those days.\"\nFurthermore, I contend that one day in the distant future, despite the wild-eyed claims of Biblical literalists, it will be ascertained that man has evolved to his current state of nobility from lesser creatures such as I encountered that night in the wilderness\nAt any rate, my adventure with the white creature was only the lesser of extraordinary events of the next few days. As we climbed higher into the mountains, I, as did many others, felt myself becoming ill, a feeling of extreme lassitude mixed with nausea. On the 19th of December on a frigid night as a blizzard beat at our tents, I lay in my blankets in a state of misery when a peculiar sensation traversed my spine.\nI looked up to see a shadowy, insubstantial figure hovering beside me in the gloom of my tent. The figure, which gave off a peculiar bluish glow, was of the height of a small man and seemed to have no more substance than a will of the wisp. As I regarded the intruder balefully, I saw it lay a steadying hand upon my arm although I could feel nothing.\n\"Be not afraid, Lieutenant Hixon,\" the figure said in a voice that I instantly recognized as that of Major Hamilton.\nAt that point, it is fair to say that my hair stood on end.\n\"I am not afraid, Major,\" I said, trying to regain my composure.\n\"Good, in that case I must speak to you,\" the major said in sepulchral tones.\nI did not protest that I had seen the major slain and buried not over six months previous, for it was obvious to me that I was dealing with a new set of facts that set aside my narrow preconceptions of how reality worked. I simply listened carefully.\n\"I have returned from the land of shadows to give a proper accounting of the events that occurred on the day of my death, Captain, but first I wish to thank you for the boon that you have created for my reputation. Your fictional comment to the press that I murmured to you prior to dying that I had no intention under any circumstances to shoot was a stroke of genius and has done much to redeem me for history, and for that I must commend you. However, there are things you do not know about that morning.\"\nI held my breath, awaiting what the major would next say.\nHe drew nearer to me. \"Despite what you have reported about my motives that fateful morning, Captain Hixon, my intentions were to rid the nation of a despicable cur. To that end and without your knowledge, I had tampered with the pistols.\n\"Each of them was equipped with a secret hair-trigger activated only by a cunningly concealed button beneath the handle. Whoever knew of such a button would have an immeasurable advantage in the duel. And so, with no one's knowledge, I activated the hair trigger designed especially for me by an Italian gunsmith, the inventor of the triple-barrel.\n\"However, as Burr and I stood back to back, weapons aloft, preparing to march and fire, I was overcome by a number of objections to my plan. By gaining unfair advantage would not I become as low a creature as the despicable danger to the nation whom I was about to face? Would not my act constitute murder rather than the chivalric settlement of a dispute?\n\"At the same time, a competing thought nagged at my mind--the concept of raw fear. I was, as you know, far from a religious man, and the idea of dying a bloody death with a gunshot wound at point blank range began to terrify me. Thus, as Dr. Fortescue gave the command to march ten paces, despite my outward composure, I was torn with inner doubts as to my proper course of action.\n\"Then when the command was given to FIRE! my fear triumphed. I wheeled and lowered the pistol with the intent of shooting Burr full in the face, but in the incredible tension of the moment, I failed to realize that I had exerted minute pressure upon the hair trigger. Thus, my shot whirled harmlessly over my assailant's head.\"\n\"But, sir,\" I cried, \"were you aware that it has since been learned that Burr arrived at Weehawken that day clad in a cunning, lightweight, metallic suit of body armor made by the most ingenious engineers of New England? Any unfair advantage you may have intended to have taken would have been matched by the chicanery of your opponent. In short, sir, you were doomed from the moment you stepped out of the row boat and climbed the cliffs of Weehawken.\"\nClasping me about the shoulders with strange, insubstantial arms, Major Hamilton said, \"It is of no matter now one way or the other, Hixon, for let me assure you I have gone to a far better place.\"\nAnd with that I watched in amazement as the major simply disappeared through the walls of my tent.\nSince that occasion, I have spoken to no one about my strange nocturnal visitation, and my life has proceeded with the pedestrian, non-supernatural character that most of us take for granted as normal.\nHowever, before I depart this life,\nI have felt an obligation to report upon those events which I have personally\nexperienced. That is why I have taken pen in hand. Those strange events\nexperienced by me in the depths of the American wilderness lead me to believe\nthere is a hidden dimension surrounding us, a dimension that despite the\nmajesty of our ever-increasing scientific knowledge, remains unknown, but\nbeckons us with shining hope for the future of all mankind.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050903212707\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/janmar2001\/captains.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The Internet's Premier Magazine of Historical Science Fiction","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/MveDweAMJdWc18MogCpp0eck-OE.json","volume":2.0,"issues":1.0,"has_text":true}

Unlike many older cemeteries,\nTulocay is a showpiece for the community, always well-maintained--grass trimmed\nneater than a golf course green, shrubbery immaculately manicured, every weed\npulled, even the oldest monuments and headstones in excellant repair. Many of\nthe gravesites are shaded by magnificent live or black oaks, spiderweb-like\nSpanish moss dangling from the trees the only hint of decadence .\nPerhaps\na fitting place of rest for my girl, the beautiful Caitlin Ann O\u2019Toole.\nI\nthink they told me she was buried last Tuesday. . .or maybe it was Wednesday.\nNot quite sure, everything such a confusing blur since the accident a week ago.\nWhichever day, I know I was not able to attend Caitlin\u2019s burial, because I was\nlying unconscious in a bed in ICU at Queen of the Valley Hospital. When I\nfinally awakened for a few minutes yesterday, and the shadowy group of\ngrim-faced strangers told me all about her funeral, I was too dazed from the\ndrugs to really comprehend. But now I understand; and I am devastated with grief\nand anguish, obsessed with questions:\nWhy\nsomeone so young? Why now? Why\nher and not me?\nNo\nanswers.\nAnd\neven stronger than the obsessive questions is the overwhelming sense of guilt I\nfeel.\nOh,\nyes, guilt. For you see, without a doubt, I killed Caitlin. Me, mister big shot with\nthe cool ideas.\nIt\nhappened last Saturday, the evening of Caitlin\u2019s Senior Prom--an affair she\nwould not attend.\nInstead of taking our graduating girl friends out someplace commercial\nfor dinner, Chuck and I set up a special affair for Cindy and Caitlin up on Mt.\nGeorge. It was unusually clear, the night lit up by the stars glittering like\njewels against a backdrop of black velvet, the brilliant lights of downtown San\nFrancisco visible thirty miles to the south, St. Helena in the heart of the wine\ncountry glowing fifteen miles to the north, and Napa stretched out, sparkling at\nour feet.\nChuck\u2019s\nlittle sister and her friend were our private waitresses, dressed up in cute\nlittle black and white tux-like outfits with mini-skirts\nand bowties. They served us an elegant six-course dinner, with all the trimmings\nincluding linen, silverware, and a bottle of Mums chilled in an ornate silver\nice bucket.\nOh,\nit was wonderful, both Caitlin and Cindy really surprised and delighted by the\noutdoor dining arrangement, the great food, terrific service, and spectacular\nview.\nWe\nlingered over chocolate cheesecake, enjoying the twinkling light show, Chuck and\nI finishing most of a second bottle of champagne. Finally,\nthe girls were ready to leave, anxious to get down the mountain to the prom. But\nCaitlin and I didn\u2019t join Chuck,\nCindy,\nand the young waitresses; we hadn\u2019t ridden up to Mt. George in my best\nfriend\u2019s Firebird. Oh, no, I thought it would be cool to drive to the mountain\ndinner site and the prom, despite our formal dress, on my brother\u2019s borrowed\nsilver and black Kawasaki. Yeah, real cool.\nSo,\nafter helping pack everything back up in the trunk of the car, and letting them\nleave first, we were late coming back down the mountain. We descended the five\nmiles of sharp curves and switchbacks, Caitlin hanging on behind me with only\none arm, her free hand pressed against a scarf to keep her red hair in place. We\nroared down the mountain, tilting to the left, back quickly upright, leaning\nright around a curve. . .left. . .right. . .left. Never more than a hundred\nyards of straight road, with steep drop-offs just beyond the narrow shoulders.\nStill,\nwe almost made it.\nBut,\nnear the foot of the mountain, just before the last S-curve by the Sheriff\u2019s\nRange, I swung out and passed a pickup loaded with hay bales, then cut quickly\nback into our lane to avoid an oncoming car, its lights temporarily blinding me.\nI drifted too wide, hit a stretch of loose shoulder gravel, over-compensated,\nand lost traction with the bike.\nTime,\nperception, thought altered. . .everything happening after that point in super\nslow-motion: Moving horizontally on the Kawasaki, me holding on tightly with\nhands and knees, but Caitlin flying off, rolling head-over-heals like a\ngymnastic tumbler, then she disappeared from view, as all movement stopped. I\nwas staring up again into the glittering gem-filled sky, my vision tunneling,\nblurring. A sinking sensation, then. . . .\nBlackness.\nSometime\nlater, I remembered slowly crawling around, trying unsuccessfully to find\nCaitlin. No sign of her anywhere close.\nAnd\nthe air filled with the wailing of approaching sirens.\nBlackness\nagain.\nWhen\nI awoke the second time in a world of agony, the ambulance from Piner\u2019s was\nalready there; and they were taking me away before I could tell them about\nCaitlin.\n\u201cNo,\nno,\u201d I called, trying to reach back despite my own pain, but strong hands\nrestrained me.\nAs\nthey worked on me in the ambulance, I felt numb all over but my hearing seemed\nsuper-acute; and I heard one of the paramedics whisper to the other that I was\nhallucinating, talking about a dead girl left back at the scene of the accident.\nThey\u2019d found no one except me. But, in my heart, I knew she was back there\nsomewhere in the darkness\u2026 alone.\nGod,\nno! I thought. It wasn\u2019t fair. I hadn\u2019t proposed yet, even though we had\ntalked many times. In fact, she\u2019d said specifically that we would be together forever.\nBut now we would never make it to a future wedding date. What had I done. . .?\nBlessedly,\nI was sucked down again into the now familiar empty blackness, where I lingered\nmost of the next week.\nEarlier\ntonight, after dozing off in my ICU bed, I dreamed that somewhere in the\ndistance Caitlin beckoned; and I\nheard her gently whisper my name, \u201cMichael, come to me, Michael.\u201d\nI\nawakened keenly alert this time, the room full of her fresh, spicy-citrus scent.\nDespite my multiple injuries, it was remarkably easy to get up and dress. Then,\nlike a bloodhound, I followed her distinctive smell through the hospital\ncorridors, outside to the parking lot, then across Trancas Street, and\nsoutheasterly toward the foothills. . . toward Tulocay.\nAs\nusual during the summers in Napa, an evening fog creeps into the valley from the\nBay Area around midnight, rising up into the foothills, and eventually\ncompletely shrouding the cemetery. Tonight, the full moon rising over the\neastern mountain range appears fuzzy in the mist, resembling a greenish-yellow\nJapanese lantern. And even though it casts a pale light, the shadows from the\nmoss-draped oak trees cloak the gravesites in almost total darkness.\nI\ncome up over a little knoll, confused by the fog and shadows, searching\nunsuccessfully for Caitlin\u2019s headstone and gravesite. I continue looking,\neventually finding myself in the older section of the cemetery.\nSuddenly,\na damp breeze, heavy with spicy-citrus scent, swirls into my face.\nI\nblink, and there she stands, off to the right under a huge black oak, not ten\nfeet away, looking so natural and lovely, exactly like last Saturday night,\nstill dressed in her pale-green formal with the dark green orchid, her fiery-red\nhair unscarved and cascading down her bare shoulders, her emerald eyes shining\nbrightly. Like always, so shy, so proper, so Victorian\u2026 Exactly as I remember\nher except she is not wearing her gloves, and she is highlighted by an eerie,\nfaint luminescent glow, that makes her stand out from the shadows, looking so\nyoung\u2026reminding me that she has not aged a day in the four years since\nwe first met.\nMy\npulse races wildly as she beckons me.\nI\ntake one step, then hesitate.\nAt\nthe same time that my heart encourages me to move closer, I feel a sudden\nchilling sense of unease, raising goosebumps on the back of my neck. . .almost a\nsense of dread.\nI\nremain in place, a few feet away.\n\u201cShe\ncan\u2019t really want me,\u201d I whisper to myself, lips barely parted.\nImpossible. I am the one who killed her. She has to blame me for the\nterrible thing I have done to her. Remaining in place, I search her face\ncarefully.\nBut\nno, she is smiling sincerely, her expression accepting, not condemning at all.\nNot a trace of blame. And she is shaking her head, as if negating my guilt.\nWhen\nI don\u2019t move closer, Caitlin places her hands on her hips and gazes at me with\nher special look; then she shrugs, and shakes her head slightly, as if aware of\nmy confusion, but dismissing it. She gestures at the face of the tombstone to\nthe left of her feet, pointing down at the gothic lettering.\nI\nmove close enough to read the entire inscription:\nCaitlin Ann O\u2019Toole\nThe\nfitting epigram comes from the last line of a memorial speech Caitlin intended\nto give at graduation, in honor of three of her classmates who had died at\ndifferent times during the last four years: Those taken early are forever\nyoung. An ironic last line now.And the dates? I must\u2019ve misread the dates.\nCaitlin couldn\u2019t be 170 years old. She is\u2026forever young. My God! My eyes\nmist.\nI\nnod, wipe my eyes, and glance up at Caitlin, wondering why she has called me\nhere tonight. To reveal her secret? But why now?\nShe\nis smiling ever so sweetly, shaking her head, as if privy to my silent\nquestions; and she points nearer the trunk of the great black oak\u2026to a freshly\ndug gravesite hidden in the deep shadows, actually the site next to her\ntombstone.\nFor\na minute or so I am puzzled, overwhelmed, struggling to understand the\nimplication of the summons and this new site here next to Caitlin--\nThen,\nof course, it becomes crystal clear\u2026her secret, and what has occurred to me. Caitlin\u2019s\nsmile broadens, as she reads the understanding in my eyes.

What did they care for the fate of an ordinary\nworking man? Ha, but at last even the food of aristocrats\nwas running short. Rumor had it that even the wealthy were\nreduced to eating rats now. Served them right. And what\ngood was this General Trochu's scheme to send air balloons\nto Tours with messages? For not a single balloon\nhad succeeded in reaching Paris\nfrom the provinces. Nothing had arrived but useless dispatches\nstrapped to the legs of carrier pigeons.\n\"Guy!\nThe pain!\" Therese's suffering cry, ripped Le Brun\nback to reality. He knelt beside his wife and took her\ndirty hand. Sweat beaded on her forehead, for this must\nhave been the hottest August on record.\n\"Is\nit time, Therese? Should I go for Madame Harvel?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nTherese's lips were swollen and cracked, and deep lines\nof care traversed her forehead. The natural beauty of youth\nhad already left her face as a result of the siege though\nshe was not thirty years of age.\nDamn, Louis\nNapoleon. Damn his successor Trochu. Something must be done\nabout these ruling bastards. The supposed enemy the Prussians\nhad apparently gone into a coma, content to sit outside\nthe city walls until the last Parisian starved to death\nor died of disease. The real enemy were the blood-sucking\ntraitors within.\n\u201cGuy, are\nyou going?\u201d\n\"Yes,\nsweetest, I was lost in thought. I\u2019ll go at once.\"\nLe Brun flung\nhimself into the filthy street where the bones of a dead\nhorse, stripped of its flesh, lay in the filthy gutter.\nIn a few steps he was outside the hovel that Madame Harvel\nand her husband, the printer, called home. Le Brun beat\non the door with his huge fists, rattling its hinges.\n\"Who\nin the hell's there?\" The drunken voice of Harvel roared\nat him.\n\"It's\nme, Guy. Therese is ready to deliver. I need your wife.\"\n\"Eh,\nJosette!\" Harvel cried, staggering to the door in a\nwine-stained undershirt, \"go help the wife of Le Brun.\nThe sewer worker is about to give us another rat.\"\nThen turning\nto Le Brun, Harvel said, \"The last thing in the world\nthis city needs is another baby, but we have to deliver\nthem, don't we? Why we don't crush their brains out and\nsave the Prussians the trouble is beyond me.\"\n\"You're\na fatalist, Harvel,\" Le Brun said. \"Now you listen\nto me. What we should do is get thirty good men armed with\nstaffs and pikes and knives and march on the Tuileries and\nkidnap the idiots running this city. Then we'll deal with\nthe Prussians in our own way.\"\n\"What\nway is that, Le Brun? You talk like you have some sort of\nplan.\"\n\"Plan?\nYes, I do, but first we must deal with our own oppressors.\"\nHarvel laughed\ndrunkenly. \"Yes, I can see you are insane, Le Brun.\nHere you are an unemployed sewer foreman talking about a\nplan to defeat the Prussians. Why if I weren't so damn drunk,\nI'd take the trouble to ask you what this grandiose scheme\nof yours is.\"\nMadame Hervel\nsuddenly appeared from the back room, pulling on her bonnet.\n\"Out of the way you disgusting men. I've work to do.\"\nAnd with that she pushed past Le Brun and hurried towards\nTherese.\nA half-hour\nlater, Le Brun marveled as his tiny, pink wriggling son\nmet daylight with a tortured cry. Madame Harvel tied the\nslick and shiny bluish umbilical into a knot after she handed\nTherese the infant. Le Brun marveled. The mysterious processes\nof birth and death were so little different for men and\nfor animals. How could these pompuous priests make the\nclaim that man was a unique creation of God? Utter nonsense,\nyet how wonderful the crumpled, pink infant nestled in his\nmother's arms.\n\"He's\na big one,\" Madame Harvel said. \"Mark my words.\nHe'll be a leader like his father.\"\nLe Brun's\nchest filled with pride. \u201cA leader\u201d she said. Well that\nwas good. And now, by God, that he had a son, it was time\nto act, to do something about this rank charlatan who ran\nthe country. Thirty men. It would only take thirty determined\nmen.\nWresting\nthe slippery boy from his mother's arms, Le Brun held his\nson high. \"Now listen to me, my boy. I vow that you\nshall not die a victim of the siege nor a miserable subject\nof Trochu, the disgusting refuse left behind by the absconded\ndictator Louis Napoleon. I swear on my mother's grave that\nI shall act on your behalf.\"\nTherese gave\na frightened outcry at her husband's boast. Yes, Guy was\na big man who could wrestle a bear and talk louder and faster\nthan any of his companions, but when he talked like that,\nshe grew frightened. After all, enduring the siege was bad\nenough.\nAn hour later,\nLe Brun stood at the zinc counter of Bar des Communards\nnear the corner of Rue de Moulin Vert and Rue Sans Centime.\nHarvel and a dozen others, clutching greasy wine glasses,\nlistened as Le Brun talked.\n\"Now listen to me, comrades. We\nare the victims of a ruthless, brainless conspiracy to keep\nthe poor in their place. Our enemies the French have brought\ntheir surrogates the Prussians to do their work for them.\nWhat I say is we've had enough. If each of you finds four\ngood men, we'll march of the Hotel de Ville, capture Trochu,\nand run Paris for the good of the people. Perhaps,\nwe'll even sue for peace with the Prussians. What do we\ncare about the pride of aristocrats? Don't our empty bellies\nspeak louder than their vain boasts? Think of it, my loyal\ncompanions, you, like I, have children and mouths to feed.\nHaven't we had enough of this insane siege of our city brought\nabout by Louis Napoleon's folly? I say gather your weapons,\nand tonight we march on city hall.\"\n\u201cAye,\u201d Le\nBruns\u2019 companions shouted.\nTwo hours\nlater, the motley horde of communards, armed with axes and\nclubs and rifles, stomped through the dark streets and alleys\nin the direction of the Hotel de Ville. With Le Brun at\ntheir head, clad in down-at-heel boots and a feathered hat\nhe had found floating in the Seine, they approached the\nwrought iron fence surrounding city hall, expecting armed\nopposition.\nHowever,\nto their amazement a single sentry whom they easily throttled\nstood guard at the gate. Their courage fortified with wine,\nthey stumbled towards the front doors of Trochu's residence,\nwhich again to their amazement they found standing open.\nLess than\na minute later, they confronted the old, bald general in\nhis stocking feet standing at the foot of the stairs holding\na candle.\n\"What\ndo you intruders want?\" Trochu's voice trembled with\nan air of resignation.\nLe Brun kicked\nover a velvet chair with his booted foot and hoisted himself\nonto a low-lying table where he waved a borrowed sword in\nthe air.\n\"In the name of the people of Paris we declare your corrupt government\nforfeit, Trochu. From this moment on we communards shall\nrun the city as we choose for the good of mankind.\"\n\"You\ntalk poppycock,\" Trochu said. \"Why if the likes\nof you had power, there would be greater corruption than\nthe worst imaginable corruption by a king or an emperor.\"\n\"You\ndare say that?\" Harvel cried, striking the old man\nwith his hat.\nBefore Trochu\ncould respond, there was a terrible clamor in a back room.\nLe Brun rushed to see what the disturbance was; then to\nhis amazement, he saw a column of heavily-armed soldiers\nemerging from a stairway in the basement that must have\nled to a tunnel.\nThere was\nno time for discussion. The National Guard was firing on\nthe run. A dozen of the communards fell at the first volley,\nand Le Brun found himself taken prisoner as quickly as he\nhad declared himself in charge.\nWithin the\nhour, he found himself behind bars in a cell far beneath\nthe Hotel de Ville.\n\"Hey,\njailer, I have a message for Trochu,\" Le Brun cried\nin his considerable voice.\n\"You're\na fool. Shut up!\"\n\"No, listen to me. I've a scheme\nto lift the siege from Paris.\nGet me Trochu!\"\nThe guard\ngradually crumbled under Le Brun's ceaseless importuning.\nAt last the sewer foreman was dragged from his cell to the\nmain floor of the Hotel de Ville, where he confronted Trochu,\nnow dressed in his blue general's uniform.\n\"General,\nmy humble apologies.\" Le Brun bowed so deeply his chin\ntouched his knees.\n\"What's\non your mind, Le Brun?\"\n\"A plan,\nsir. I have a plan to defeat the Prussians.\" Had it\nnot been for his own starving wife and his newborn son Le\nBrun would never have lowered himself this far.\nGeneral Trochu\nlaughed. \"Good, then let's hear your plan, sewer foreman.\nI need a little humor in my life.\"\nLe Brun stuck\nout his lower lip belligerently. He did not care to be insulted.\n\"OK, here is my plan.\" From his pocket he pulled\nout a tiny reed the size of a man's thumb.\n\"What\nis this?\" said Trochu, \" a new cannon we can use\nagainst Prussian midgets?\"\n\"No,\ngeneral, this is a whistle.\"\n\"Oh\nI see. That should frighten the Germans considerably.\"\n\"You\ndon't understand.\" Le Brun lifted the tiny wooden piece\nto his mouth and blew. There was no audible sound, but a\nhalf-dozen rats suddenly scurried from God knows where within\nthe walls and milled about the feet of the sewerman.\n\"Now do you\nsee?\" Le Brun said.\n\"I see\nthat you have made friends with the foulest brutes on the\nplanet,\" Trochu said, \"now back to your cell.\nYou're wasting my time.\"\n\"No!\"\ncried Le Brun, \"the rats that I have summoned with\nmy invention are the most ravenous imaginable. I have trained\nsuch rats to come when I call. Were they turned upon the\nPrussians, the Germans would be overwhelmed.\"\n\"You're\na madman, Le Brun.\"\n\"Am\nI, general?\u201d Sweat poured down Le Brun\u2019s face. \u201cIs it too\nmuch of a risk to allow me to go free to the sewers and\nescape beyond the barricades where I can pipe to my ravenous\nfriends and turn them upon the Prussians?\"\nLe Brun's eyes\nglowed with a fine madness that Trochu found impressive.\n\"OK,\nI\u2019m listening,\" said the general, \"there's little\nrisk in setting you loose in a sewer where you belong. Why\nnot I ask myself? Why not let you function as a general\ncommanding an army appropriately composed of rats? Guard!\nTransport this man at once to the sewers adjacent to the\nSeine. Turn him loose and let him remain so, so long as\nhe dare not show his face on the streets of the city.\"\nAnd so the\ntiny wooden whistle at his lips, Le Brun marched into the\ndark midnight sewers piping a song of his own invention.\nThe rest of it, the Prussians soldiers, their throats ripped\nout as they slept, is now but a chapter in the forgotten\nannals of history. However, the number of Prussian soldiers\ndead from rat-borne disease or the direct wound of the slashing\nteeth of the vermin is-without dispute-a figure in the tens\nof thousands. However, the ultimate fate of Guy Le Brun,\nthe communard, his wife, and his newborn son remains lost\nin the dusty annals of the past.\nWhat is known\nfor certain is that the Prussians lifted the siege within\nweeks of Le Brun's release, and the corrupt government of\nTrochu fell afterwards within days. However, what is strange,\nthough, is that the son of the piping sewer foreman rose\nto the rank of French general fighting the Germans during\nWWI, a rumor staunchly believed by the people of Paris,\na strange rumor that refuses to die.\nEnd\u2014\nRiding the night, clad in black, wraithlike,\nH. Turnip Smith searches\nfor edible roadkill and listens intently for suspicious\nmovements of worms.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050727004221\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com:80\/sewermans.htm","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/XaGyByuTQSqLGjrnxBtpKPi2CRY.json","volume":5.0,"issues":3.0,"has_text":true}

Quite a proud show we made of it, too, even if it was after midnight and hardly a soul around to see us. I\u2019ll bet we woke \u2019em up, though! We led the defenders straight down the city streets, all tramping in time to our music \u2013 to Syl Foster\u2019s fife and Nicodemus\u2019 drum. Didn\u2019t matter none that, being so young, we lacked a good foot in height on any other man in the regiment. They had to follow us, \u2019cause we two were the drill corps, and for at least that one hour, we felt like kings for sure.\nI think we were both surprised to reach camp at last and to see the \u201cfort\u201d we\u2019d been sent to. It was poorly lit by torches and weak moonlight, but any fool could see it wasn\u2019t a proper fort at all \u2013 just three broad cannon ramparts built up against the wide ditch. That ditch had been dug out, almost overnight, all around the capital for miles. But I guess I\u2019d expected to see a fort like the ones in those pictures in my school books back home; something like those wood spiked affairs they built out on the frontier, or better yet, the big stone castles with moats in the fairy tale stories. A ditch and three cannons was a trifle disappointing, for a fort.\nNary a man of us could sleep, even if it was the middle of the night. We were all sure that Jubal Early could be just brazen enough to try storming the defenses in the dark, and we were going to be ready. So soon as all the bedding assignments were done with, I went down to the colored soldiers\u2019 tent to find Nick. I figured we could maybe work out what songs to line up for tomorrow, just in case we had drill as usual, instead of a battle.\nIf we got a chance to drill with the drum and bugle corps that was already here with the 3rd Massachusetts, maybe we could learn some new songs, or maybe teach them a few. I\u2019d ask \u2019em if they knew Lorena yet. Didn\u2019t matter none to us that it started out a Reb song. We Yanks liked it, too, and so we took it for our own.\nI found Nick out behind the Negro bivouac, sitting by a camp fire and whittling himself a new drumstick.\n\u201cBroke one on the way in,\u201d he said when I came up and sat down on the other side of his fire. \u201cNobody\u2019s sleepin\u2019 nohow, so I thought I might as well do sumpthin\u2019 useful.\u201d\n\u201cMakes good sense,\u201d I answered, and found I had to scoot back a ways from the fire. It was July, and so sticky-hot in these parts, you didn\u2019t really need a fire except if you wanted the light. \u201cYou think maybe we should use Old 1812 and Minstrel Boy for drill tomorrow?\u201d\nNick\u2019s whittling knife stopped in mid-stroke and his large black eyes blinked at me, little flames dancing in \u2019em. \u201cIf there\u2019s drill, you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. If.\u201d\n\u201cThem\u2019s fine. And maybe Hell on the Wabash, too. I got the beat on that\u2019n real good.\u201d\nI nodded, and Nick went back to whittling. His knife made soft skritch skritch noises as he worked. The fire popped and snapped when his wood shavings flew into it.\n\u201cYou think Jubal will do it?\u201d I asked at length. I had to admit, part of me hoped the Rebs would see the capital wasn\u2019t defenseless after all, and would turn tail and run before morning. \u201cYou think he\u2019ll attack?\u201d\nNicodemus didn\u2019t answer for a long while. He rubbed the finished drumstick on the sleeve of his too-large uniform, then, apparently satisfied, slipped both stick and whittling knife into a pocket. Only then did he push back his kepi and look across the fire at me, as though I\u2019d only just posed him the question.\n\u201cScared?\u201d he asked.\nI pretended to a sudden need for rolling up the cuffs some more on my own ill-fitting trousers, and didn\u2019t answer his question any more than he\u2019d answered mine.\n\u201cWe just gon hafta stop him, is all.\u201d Nick said it as though the declaration alone made it a sure thing. Then he looked me over good and smiled sorta grim-like. \u201cWhat\u2019s givin\u2019 you the heebie-jeebies, Syl? Ain\u2019t you never seen no battles before?\u201d\nI supposed I might as well admit it, so I shook my head \u201cno\u201d and stared back into the fire some more. At fourteen, Nicodemus had only a year on me, but he was already a veteran. He\u2019d grown up a slave, but had been drumming for the 151st Ohio ever since the start of the war, when the Yanks had taken Nashville and told him he was free. Me, I\u2019d only signed up two months back, after trying three times and getting sent back home, till I could finally get my pap\u2019s consent.\n\u201cSince I joined up,\u201d I said, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything but a whole lot of drilling and marching, marching and drilling. I\u2019ve never even got within spitting distance of a Reb. Don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if I ever got a real shot at one, or him at me.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019 worry none.\u201d Nick weaved his long slim fingers in between each other. \u201cYou\u2019ll see fightin\u2019 soon enough. And you\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, hating myself for the coward I must sound like. \u201cI guess so.\u201d\nCamp rumor said Abe Lincoln himself might be coming out to watch Early\u2019s attack. I thought that was odd, \u2019cause I couldn\u2019t think of anything would make the Rebs any happier than having Old Abe to shoot at. I wondered where he planned to watch from.\n\u201cTell you what...\u201d Nicodemus had got up and come around to my side of the camp fire. From somewhere under his coat, he pulled out a round, palm-sized thing the color of blood, and pressed it into my hand. \u201cYou keep this in your pocket tomorrow. An\u2019 if we gets a battle out of ol\u2019 Jubal, you reach in and squeeze this jus\u2019 as hard as you kin squeeze.\u201d\nI tilted the thing into the light and saw it glow a more fiery red. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d I told him, but then I had to add the next part, \u2019cause I didn\u2019t have any idea. \u201cUh... What is it?\u201d\n\u201cWish stone,\u201d Nick said. \u201cCome from Africa. Used to belong to a king, so they say.\u201d\n\u201cWho said?\u201d The pretty rock\u2019s smooth edges were starting to warm to my hand.\n\u201cMy Gramma Huru. She give me that on the day she died, two weeks before Nashville done got itself lib\u2019rated. She told me whoever holds this stone and squeeze it real hard, he\u2019ll get a wish. Jus\u2019 one wish, though.\u201d\nI had to smile at that, and almost handed the trinket back to him. But on a whim, I put it into my tunic pocket instead and asked him, \u201cDid it grant you your wish?\u201d\nHe looked a shade disappointed. \u201cNot yet. Will, though.\u201d\n\u201cWell, what\u2019d you wish for? Or does telling spoil it?\u201d\n\u201cNope.\u201d He sat down beside me and stared into the fire, too. \u201cI jus\u2019 done like Moses, that\u2019s all. Wished my people free. Wished all the Negroes free, everywhere. Made that wish out loud, the very same minute Gramma Huru gived me the stone. An\u2019 you know what she say?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cShe say, \u2018It\u2019ll be, Nicodemus, it\u2019ll be. Maybe not right now, not today, but tomorrow. Tomorrow we be free.\u2019 Well, we didn\u2019 all get free on the next day. So I figured she musta meant some other tomorrow.\u201d He grinned at me. \u201cYou see Old Abe in the mornin\u2019, you tell him for us that we\u2019s still waitin\u2019.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t know what to say to that, so I just smiled back and nodded again, and we both sat and watched the fire till it burned itself all the way out.\nAs a rule, I didn\u2019t put no stock in magic charms. Back home in Lima, there were plenty of old wives who swore by the \u201cmagic\u201d in those little asafetida bags they hung round your neck when you got the croup. Only thing they ever gave me was more croup and a powerful stink besides.\nNick\u2019s wish stone, though, I took back to the tent with me. I fished it out of my tunic before I hung that up and then got onto my bedroll and held the stone up to the moonlight coming in the tent flap. I looked into its dark depths and wished there was such a thing as magic. And I thought to myself, if there was such a thing, Sylvanus Foster, and you only had one wish, what would you wish for?\nI had to think some on that.\nWhile the sentries outside scuffed the dirt path back and forth from the flag pole and the few other men in the tent snored and muttered in their sleep, I stared at Nick\u2019s \u201cmagic\u201d bauble and decided that just wishing to live through a battle was maybe a pretty big waste of its powers. I wondered why it hadn\u2019t granted Nick his wish yet, and if it ever really would. I\u2019d never met any colored people till I joined the OVI, but I knew I didn\u2019t hold with slavery nor with all the bad things some folks said about Nicodemus\u2019 people being cursed of God, and such nonsense. I liked Nick well enough. So why shouldn\u2019t he get his wish that the Negroes all be free?\nThat set me wondering how much longer the war could go on for, and after it was finally over, then what? General Grant was supposed to have Lee on the run down in Richmond: he\u2019d pulled so many troops out to help him, he\u2019d nearly left Washington City defenseless. Which was why we were here. But even if Lee did surrender and the war come to be over, I wondered how much would be left to start over with. And how on God\u2019s earth did you put Rebs and Yanks back together again and expect \u2019em to just shake hands like all was forgiven, after so many years of shootin\u2019 at each other?\nI couldn\u2019t see any way to do that. But then, I guess it would all be Abe Lincoln\u2019s row to hoe when it was over.\nJust like freeing the slaves would be.\nI didn\u2019t see how exactly he could accomplish that, either, but I\u2019d sure give a lot to come back in a hundred years or so and see how it\u2019d all come out.\nThen I thought, All right, Nicodemus. Here\u2019s a wish for your magic rock after all. And I squeezed the pebble hard. If it can really grant a wish, then I\u2019ll ask it to show me your children\u2019s children and my children\u2019s children and how they fare with each other a hundred years from now. That\u2019s what I\u2019d wish.\nNothing happened, of course. The charm didn\u2019t grant my wish any more than it had granted Nick\u2019s two years ago in Nashville. Maybe it planned on waiting, like he said, for some other tomorrow. Shrugging, I slipped the bauble into my trouser pocket for safekeeping, and turned over to get some shut-eye.\nShots and a bugle call woke me. It was barely after dawn and all hell was breaking loose in camp, with men scrambling for shoes, tunics and guns all at once and the officers outside bellowing orders over the sound of more gunfire. My rifle was taller than me by eight inches and I tripped over it twice just getting out of the tent. Didn\u2019t need it after all, though, as I wound up ordered to join the relay lines passing shells from the bunkers up to the cannon ramps. They were eight-inch bore 69-pounders, those cannons, big enough to shake the ground and dull your ears when they went off. The shells were mighty heavy, too, especially after you\u2019d hefted the first five or six of \u2019em.\nSmoke, cannons, shouts and gunfire were all I knew then for what seemed to be hours. I never did see a Reb, but I heard \u2019em shootin\u2019 clear enough, and every now and then there\u2019d come a cry from one of the sharpshooters who got hit up on the breastworks.\nThe smoke got so thick I could hardly see or breathe, but there was nothing for it but to cough and wipe my eyes and keep on passing shells. I also kept one foot up against my rifle on the ground beside me, even though I prayed all along not to need it.\nAfter a while, I caught a glimpse of Nicodemus up the relay line a ways, standing with the other colored soldiers close to the left-most cannon ramp. Every time a guidon fell and signaled one of the cannoneers to fire, Nick would put his hands over his ears, even if someone was trying to pass him a shell at the same time. I wished I\u2019d thought of that, but right now in all the thunderous noise, I couldn\u2019t tell if my ears might be ringing or not.\nI almost didn\u2019t hear the order to cease passing and come to attention: I only made sense of it when everyone around me did that. So I stood at attention and wondered what was going on. The gunfire from the battlements hadn\u2019t stopped, so the fight couldn\u2019t possibly be over.\nSomeone shouted something. The men on either side of me stiffened up even more. I looked where they seemed to be looking, and through the haze, saw Generals Wright and McCook and two officers walking with a tall man in a black coat and a high hat. I didn\u2019t realize it was Abe Lincoln with \u2019em till they\u2019d walked right past us and continued up the center ramp all the way to the parapet. I wondered why he hadn\u2019t taken that hat off, such a handy target as it would make, but then the order to resume passing came, and we got back to business.\nFort Stevens had been dug out around a big oak tree that rose front and center of the ramparts, and it was next to that President Lincoln chose to stand and observe the battle. Cannon smoke almost obscured him from our view, but it wasn\u2019t long before Jubal\u2019s troops must\u2019ve spotted him, \u2019cause a Reb shell landed smack on that oak and split it, with more shots flying close behind. One of the officers with Lincoln pushed him down just as another soldier who\u2019d been moving to protect the president got hit, cried out and fell. The Yank sharpshooters up on the wall opened up, and in another moment they\u2019d whooped and hollered that they got the sniper.\nI started to turn and look for Nick again, only a loud whistling noise made me look up instead. The man next to me dropped the shell he\u2019d been about to pass and hit the dirt. Before I could do the same, the loudest noise I\u2019d ever heard and something that felt like a ton of cinder blocks knocked me clean off my feet.\nI think I flew a ways. Don\u2019t remember hitting the ground, though. The cannons and gunfire all faded into stone deaf silence, and smoke blinded my whole world gray.\nStrangest thing is, the next sound I could hear was a bird singing. No explosions, no battle cries, no guns \u2013 just one little mocking bird cheerily practicing his repertoire.\nI couldn\u2019t smell smoke anymore, and the ground under me didn\u2019t shake. The fight must be over, I figured. So I opened my eyes.\nAnd saw green grass.\nI was sure there hadn\u2019t been any grass in the camp last night, but maybe I\u2019d just missed it in the dark.\nI found I could move, so I pushed up and got to my feet. My rifle was missing. But when I looked further, I realized that so was the camp. Our bivouac, all the trees and most of the ramparts were gone, replaced by a soiled, brick-sided building and a tiny, whitewashed church. I stood in the middle of a half-acre greensward that vaguely resembled Fort Stevens only because it retained a piece of the embankment (that, too, was grass covered), three cannon ramps (only one had a cannon on it, and that was a rusting hulk), a flag pole and the ruins of an ammunition bunker. The bunker\u2019s wooden doors had been replaced with huge slabs of white sheet rock, but even that was cracked and crumbling, as though some titan with a giant hammer had taken his spite out on it.\nI didn\u2019t see a soul around.\nOnly thing I could figure was I had to be either dead or dreaming. After some thought, I ruled out dead just because this didn\u2019t look like any Heaven I\u2019d ever read of in the Good Book. So, if there was nothing for it but to wait till I woke up, I supposed I might as well have more of a look around.\nSomething made flapping noises over my head, and I gazed up at a flag up there on the pole, whipping full out in the wind. It was Old Glory, sure enough, but it wasn\u2019t quite right. There were too many stars on it.\nAnother block of that white sheet rock stood not far away, and it had a bronze plaque bolted to its top that mapped out what the camp should have looked like \u2013 had looked like, more or less, just this morning. The bronze was dark, like it\u2019d been there awhile, and in the bottom left corner it bore the inscription DEDICATED SEPTEMBER 1956 BY THE DAUGHTERS OF UNION VETERANS OF THE CIVIL WAR, 1861 - 1865.\nTwo pieces of that inscription sort of stared right back at me: the year 1956 and the word DAUGHTERS. My hand went straight into my pocket to pull out Nicodemus\u2019 wish stone. Hadn\u2019t I just told it before I fell asleep last night that I wanted to see how Nick\u2019s children\u2019s children and mine would fare in about a hundred years? Could this shiny little rock really grant wishes after all? It lay in my hand, deeper red in the sunlight, and didn\u2019t part with a single one of its secrets.\nThe roar of some terrible engine sounded from beyond the embankment. My first thought was to get down and hit the dirt again, but if this was a vision, hadn\u2019t I ought to be safe enough? The sound faded off. Emboldened, I climbed a cannon ramp up to the parapet, where another bronze plaque pictured Lincoln under fire, and gazed over the top at what I knew had been open ground north of Washington City: the ground Jubal Early had attacked us from this morning.\nIt was all gone.\nNo fields, no farm houses, no trees. Just dirty brick buildings as far as the eye could see, all cramped and crowded together, surrounding my greensward on all four sides. A wide stretch of tarred road and a smaller one of white sheet rock lay between, and on the road\u2019s edge, unattended, sat a row of gleaming glass and metal carriages. Leastways, they looked like carriages, as they each had strange, fat black wheels on \u2019em. But there wasn\u2019t a horse in sight anywhere.\nThe crack-whine of a gunshot made me duck fast behind the embankment. Someone shouted something, and three more shots went off in rapid succession. I hunkered down behind the Lincoln marker till the shooting stopped, then carefully peeked around its edge till I could see the road.\nTwo colored boys, neither of \u2019em much older than Nick, had run into the street, and right behind them had come five white soldiers in peculiar dark blue uniforms I\u2019d never seen the like of before. They carried guns and clubs, those soldiers, and they caught up to both boys right there on the sheet rock in front of the dugout, where they commenced to beating them senseless. Black folks started pouring out of the buildings then, some with bricks or rocks or bottles in hand, and they set upon the soldiers with shrieks louder than any Rebel yell. They smashed the shiny glass carriages into splintered ruins, set \u2019em afire and ran like hell when more white soldiers showed up and started shooting.\nThat terrible roar I\u2019d heard before came again, along with a fearsome wailing, and right quick at least a dozen horseless wagons, all black and white with blazing red lanterns, came barreling into the fray. Dozens more soldiers spilled out of \u2019em, guns blasting.\nQuaking like a damn coward, I clutched the edge of Old Abe\u2019s bronze likeness, stayed hidden, and watched the bloodshed. My first look at a real battle, and I couldn\u2019t do nothing but watch, \u2019cause my feet rooted and just plain refused to budge.\nI saw Negroes shot down in cold blood and soldiers beaten into pulp by blacks who\u2019d managed to gang up on them. The two boys the first soldiers had set upon were shackled and dragged, screaming, off to a wagon while a colored woman followed and cried that they hadn\u2019t \u201cdone nuthin\u2019 wrong.\u201d Her pleas for mercy fell on deaf ears.\nBigger wagons arrived, and now the soldiers had clearly won the skirmish, for they quickly herded or carried every last Negro into those transports. Then they picked up the dead ones and took them as well. Their own dead and wounded they hauled away in a different sort of wagon, but in the end, they took everyone, and roared away with their red lanterns blazing.\nThe burned carriages stank and smoldered. Glass exploded out of one of them and scattered itself with an almost musical sound across the oiled road. Behind me, a stiff breeze snapped and fluttered the flag with too many stars.\nI don\u2019t know how long it took me to convince my feet to hold me up again. I climbed up onto the parapet for a better look at the battlefield, but somehow all I could look at was a bright pool of blood on the white sheet rock where the soldiers had beaten the two Negro boys.\nWhen I did tear my gaze away, it was because a glint of sunlight caught my eye. I looked up and away, past the burning wagons and the squalid brick houses, over the rooftops to a thing familiar from the Washington City I knew. There, not more than a ten minute march away, stood the gold-gilded Capitol dome. It should have been a comfort, seeing something I recognized in this grim, war-torn place, but it wasn\u2019t. Would our children\u2019s children\u2019s world really come to this? Could the law of our great land truly have allowed this horror to go on for so long?\nI made a fist, and shook it at the gleaming, golden dome.\n\u201cWhat did our boys fight and die for?\u201d I shouted. \u201cNick\u2019s people are still in chains! It was all for nothing!\u201d\nI raged at it for several minutes more, but the dome only glittered at me in the bright sun, and staunchly refused to care.\n* * *\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I heard a gruff voice say. \u201cShell concussion knocked him flat, that\u2019s all.\u201d\nI had to think on it a spell before it seemed I remembered how to open my eyes. When I did, I saw two hazy forms standing at a tent flap. From his black bag I figured one for a sawbones. The other one was Nicodemus.\n\u201cYou can go in now, boy,\u201d the doc said, and he hustled off, the leather bag making skiff-skuff noises as it rubbed against his long black coat.\nNick came in, and seeing my eyes were open, he knelt down next to my bedroll and grinned at me. \u201c\u2019Bout time you waked up,\u201d he said. \u201cSawbones says you\u2019ll live, but I could tell he was powerful disappointed not to be cuttin\u2019 no arms or legs off you.\u201d\n\u201cPowerful sorry to disappoint him,\u201d I replied, borrowing his words. I realized then that I couldn\u2019t hear any cannons or gunfire. \u201cBattle over?\u201d I asked.\nNicodemus nodded. \u201cHours ago, right after you got knocked out. Gen\u2019ral Jubal, he got in his shot at Old Abe, then seein\u2019 as he missed an\u2019 our boys got his sniper, he lobbed that last shell up over the \u2019bankment and took off runnin\u2019. We been celebratin\u2019 ever since.\u201d\n\u201cThey missed Old Abe,\u201d I repeated, and smiled \u2019cause I remembered seeing the officer push the president down just before the shell had gone off.\n\u201cShore did,\u201d said Nick. \u201cLieutenant Holmes, he grabbed Lincoln and yelled \u2018Get down, you fool!\u2019 jus\u2019 like he was talkin\u2019 to some green recruit. Landed square on top of \u2019im, too! You\u2019d a thought Old Abe\u2019d be hoppin\u2019 mad, only he jus\u2019 picks \u2019isself back up when it\u2019s all over, dusts off his stovepipe and says to Holmes, \u2018Son, it sure is a good thing you know how to talk to civilians!\u2019 Had the whole lot of us fallin\u2019 down laughin\u2019 till we couldn\u2019 laugh no more!\u201d\nI laughed too, though it made my head hurt. I remembered the wish stone then, and had to squirm some to fish it out of my pocket and hold it out to Nick. \u201cReckon I can give this back to you now,\u201d I said.\nHe frowned a bit, although he took it. \u201cWhat\u2019d it show you?\u201d he asked, just as if he already knew about my vision.\nI didn\u2019t rightly know what to say. I just couldn\u2019t tell him that a hundred years from now, there\u2019d still be a war on, and his people would still be slaves, and the only thing white folks would\u2019ve learned is how to build shiny wagons without needing no horses to pull \u2019em. I couldn\u2019t tell him none of that, so I just said, \u201cIt showed me that your Grandma Huru was right.\u201d\nHe looked puzzled at that. \u201cAbout us gettin\u2019 free, you mean?\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d I said, and closed my eyes again because my head still ached and I felt suddenly very tired. \u201cTomorrow.\u201d\nAnd before I fell asleep, I prayed that somewhere, in some future tomorrow, Nick\u2019s wish really would come true.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050906051005\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/octdec2000\/free.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"Jean Graham's first WTIW story is a delightfully chilling look into just how far we haven't come in righting old wrongs, and a hopeful glimpse into the true nature of the human spirit and its endless aspiration for something greater.","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/aI8FZn3eSOkJbxdxO-TQEj5R1sE.json","volume":1.0,"issues":3.0,"has_text":true}

Built along classic\nlines, she had the head and breasts of a beautiful woman atop the body of a\nlion, plus a serpent's tail with a pair of great white wings fluttering from her\nshoulders. Thankfully, a golden\nbreastplate covered her quivering buxom bosom.\nA good ten meters tall and some twenty meters long, her voice, though\nremarkably pleasant, was quite loud.\nHungrily, the sphinx viewed the tiny morsels.\nOne was quite old with a stock of white hair and needed a cane to stand.\nHardily a single bite for her there.\nAh, but the other was a massive, tanned, slab of muscle some two meters\ntall.

These\nmen were surprised, but the heady aroma of raw terror was blatantly absent. An angry growl welled deep within her throat.\nWell, that would soon change!\n\"Greeting humans!\" she said in a booming contralto.\n\"What are you two doing in my forest?\"\n\"Just out for a stroll,\" Prof. Einstein replied promptly.\n\"And what are your next two questions?\"\nThe sphinx spit in ill controlled rage, the tiny globule of moisture\nhissing through rock and soil. \"Impudent\ntoads!\" she snarled, the mighty breasts heaving.\n\"Very well! What walks\non four legs in the morning-\"\n\"Man,\" Lord Carstairs interrupted, stifling a yawn.\nFrowning, the sphinx paused for a moment.\n\"You...have heard these before?\" she asked.\n\"Yes,\" Einstein replied, turning to leave.\n\"And that is three for three. Goodbye.\"\n\"HOLD!\" the giant beast thundered, blocking their path with a\npaw the size of a living room sofa. \"You\nmust now ask me a question! And if\nI can answer correctly, then death will be your reward!\"\nEinstein and Carstairs exchanged glances.\n\"Ask!\" the monster demanded licking her mighty chops, whiskers\na bristle with eagerness. She had\nbeen worried at first by their boldness, but the sphinx felt that she was back\nin control.\nQuickly, the two Englishmen conferred for a moment.\n\"With the weapons and resources immediately available to us,\"\nLord Carstairs began politely, \"what is the surest, fastest and easiest way\nfor us to kill you?\"\nWith an audible clunk, the beast dropped her jaw to the rocky ground,\nthen closed it with a snap. For\nseveral minutes, her teeth ground against each other as the she-beast engaged in\nfurious thought. Raking a clawed\npaw through her golden tresses, the sphinx stared hard at the two calm humans.\nThen, she gave a sweet smile.\n\"Gosh, what a good question,\" she admitted, in a friendly\nvoice. \"I have no idea. You\nwin! Goodbye.\"\nThen with a single bound that carried her over the trees, the winged\nbeast was gone.\n\"Sometimes, it really pays to have a classical education,\"\nLord Carstairs noted, as they continued the interrupted stroll.\n\"Quite,\" Prof. Einstein laughed, leaning heavily on his cane.\n\"This incident could have been much worse.\"\nOnce more, the British lord raised an eyebrow.\n\"Indeed, sir.

In fact, there are those who would\nargue that it is the best thing on Broadway. I myself would\nhave to say that the best thing is actually a singer down\nat the Kit-Kat club named Debele, but it is all a matter of\ntaste. There is no arguing, however, that the cheesecake at\nMindy's is very good.\nThat\nis why I am surprised to see a guy in the next booth sticking\nhis fork into a perfectly good piece of cheesecake with a\nsour look on his face. It is not the look of a man tasting\ntrue happiness. No, it is more like the look a muckraker has\nwhen trying to find the truth in a politico's promises.\nNot that the guy has the face of a newshound. His wrinkles\nare cut in his forehead much deeper than any of the baby-faced\nrookies covering the Broadway beat. And his eyes--I once saw\nthat kind of stare from Holy Jimmy when he discovered that\nLarry the Weasel's dice rolled all sevens. The Weasel saw\nit too, and now his dice are strictly legit.\nBut\nthis guy does not resemble Jimmy much other than the stare.\nPerhaps it is the bad light at Mindy's but I would swear that\nhe is a pale kind of green. Not the kind of green some johns\nare after a losing streak in a game, more like the color some\njudys paint the baby's room when they are trying to act small-town\nnormal.\nIn\nthe usual way of things, I would not have said a word. There\nare many souls on Broadway who resent a friendly inquiry,\neven if the asker has nothing but the best of intentions.\nAnd since many of these souls carry dangerous objects, a neighborly\nquestion can result in damage to one's health. But then I\nnotice that he has the morning racing form next to his uneaten\ncheesecake, and I decide to take the risk. After all, a few\nshekels can occasionally be earned by introducing those inclined\nto sporting risks to a generous bookie. And I am badly in\nneed of a few shekels. The attentions of a classy doll like\nDebele do not come cheap.\nBesides,\nhis suit is tight enough for me to think that the only thing\nconcealed under it is a large paunch.\n\"Welcome\nto Broadway,\" I say, trying not to sound like I think\nhe is a sucker.\nFortunately,\nhe does not seem to object to my intrusion. He stops digging\nat his plate and looks up. \"What is your number?\"\nI\nam not all sure how to answer. The last time someone asks\nme that question, I am a reluctant guest of the government\nat the Grey Bars Hotel. I do not think this gentleman is referring\nto that number, but nothing else comes to mind.\n\"I\nbeg your pardon?\"\nHe\nturns an even deeper shade of green. \"My mistake,\"\nhe says. \"Please, sit down.\"\nThe\nracing form has numbers scribbled all over it. There is nothing\nI like better than a man with a system. \"You are a player,\"\nI observe.\nHe\nshakes his head. \"I was hoping to find out what these\nnumbers mean. Can you tell me?\"\nImmediately,\nI change my opinion of him. This is not a player, but a new\njoe who wishes to be a player. Or perhaps a police officer\nwho wishes me to believe that he is a new joe. Not that I\nhave anything against police officers, but I have spent too\nmuch time in their company to wish to spend more. On the other\nhand, it is easier to get shekels out of a new joe than out\nof a true player.\n\"What\ndo you think they mean?\" I ask.\n\"I\nhave managed to deduce that these names are animals, and that\nthe numbers have something to do with them. And, since numbers\nare sacred, this must be some kind of religious expression.\"\nHe sighs. \"I pride myself on being a religious scholar,\nbut I will confess that this planet stumps me.\"\nI\nchange my opinion of him once more. No doubt the men in white\ncoats from Bellevue will be here to collect him soon. I try\nto stand up without alarming him.\nHe\nreaches into his pocket and pulls out several greenbacks.\n\"I would like to converse with you. Could I perhaps trade\nthese for your time?\" he says.\nI\ntake a look at these bills and sit back down. I could certainly\nuse them, especially since each has several zeros on it. As\nI said, snazzy dolls like Debele do not come cheap, and those\nshekels would come in very handy improving my luck with her.\n\"Now,\"\nhe said, \"tell me what these numbers mean.\"\n\"Why,\nthey are the odds on today's horse race.\"\nHe\nlooks at me as if I have just started banging a drum at him.\n\"What are odds?\" he asks.\nNow\nI know he is not a police officer. The question is not bogus,\nhe honestly does not know. Even the newest, dumbest flatfoot\non the block can tell you what odds are. In fact, some of\nthe men in blue have been known to place an occasional friendly\nbet, especially when the brass are not around.\nIt\ntakes me a few minutes to explain the matter to the new joe,\nand it takes even longer to explain to him what a payoff is.\nBut suddenly his eyes bug out of his head.\n\"Do\nyou mean that the numbers have real-world consequences?\"\nhe asks.\nI\nam not sure what he is driving at, but I nod anyway. There\nis nothing more real in the world than a win.\nHe\nstands up and stares at the ceiling. \"Forgive my disbelief,\"\nhe says, far too loudly for my tastes. \"I had come to\ndoubt, but this messenger of yours brings me a revelation\nI cannot ignore.\"\nI\nlook around Mindy's, hoping that there is no one who knows\nme in the place. I am in luck. The only other occupant of\nthe dining room is an old judy talking to her shopping bag,\nand she is too intent on the conversation to pay attention\nto the new joe.\nUnfortunately,\njust as I start to feel relief, in walks Sergeant Mallory.\nIt is too much to hope that he will ignore me and indeed he\ndoes not.\n\"As\nI live and breathe,\" Mallory says with a smile that I\ndo not trust at all. \"If it isn't Goodtime Luke.\"\n\"To\nofficers of the law, my name is Mr. McCall,\" I say.\nHe\nshrugs as if to say that the matter is only of small importance\nto him. \"And a gentleman that I do not recognize. Is\nthis perhaps your lawyer brother from out of town? Or perhaps\na priest cousin?\"\nIt\nis true that I have introduced various individuals to him\nas my relatives. It is also true that I have not always identified\ntheir occupations with absolute accuracy. After all, such\nmen as Sergeant Mallory take a dim view of how certain people\nearn their shekels.\nHe\neyes the bills on the table and the smile gets wider. \"Now,\nwhat have we here?\"\nThe\nnew joe chooses that moment to speak his piece. \"I don't\nappreciate this interruption, sir. This wise man here was\nexplaining the sacrament of odds to me.\"\nI\ndo not have to be Madame Olga from the tea parlour to guess\nthat this statement does not please Sergeant Mallory. \"Sacrament?\"\nhe asks with a glare, and I start to look for a way out.\nThe\nnew joe looks at the officer as if he is explaining something\nvery simple. \"A sacrament is an exemplar of the mystical\nintersecting with real-world reality. In this case, the sublimity\nof numbers intersects with a payoff. In short, sir, a sacrament.\nIt is a whole new revelation for my people. And we owe it\nall to this divine spokesman here.\"\n\"That\nwill be enough of that,\" Mallory says, and I know I am\nin serious trouble even before he starts fingering the steel\nbracelets on his belt. That is one piece of jewelry that,\ngiven a choice, I would prefer never to wear again.\n\"Am\nI to understand that you wish to take him away?\" The\nnew joe almost manages to outglare Mallory. And that is no\nsmall feat.\n\"Come\nalong now.\"\nI\nam not the sort who wishes to make trouble, so I stand. However,\nthe new joe does not seem inclined to agree. To my surprise,\nout of his ample waistband he pulls a small black box. It\nhas a silver knob on one end, and I notice that he is pointing\nit squarely at the police officer.\n\"I\ncannot allow you to remove this man,\" the new joe says\nfirmly. \"I have not yet finished assimilating the full\nimplications of this new doctrine. I still have questions.\"\n\"That\ndoes it.\" Mallory waves his nightstick in my direction.\n\"Get your . . .\"\nHe\ndoes not finish the sentence, however. Something very red\nand very bright comes out of the black box. Within a few seconds,\ninstead of an officer of the law next to the table, there\nis only a red glow, about the color of the rubies that Debele\nlikes so much. And then the red, too, just winks out.\nThe\nnew joe sits down and I do the same. I try to be very obliging\nto anyone who can make a body disappear like that. Not that\nI have seen this kind of thing before, and not that I have\nany wish to see it again. I especially have no desire to see\nfor myself where Mallory went.\nI\nam not at my best in answering more of the new joe's questions,\nand I definitely do not understand him when he starts on about\nthe qualities of numbers, but that does not seem to disturb\nhim. Finally he runs out of things to ask and pulls out that\nbox again.\nI\nwonder whether I am headed off to visit Sergeant Mallory or\nthe Pearly Gates, or both. \"Do you mind if I say some\nfinal words?\" I ask. Ideally, I would like to address\nthese words to Debele, but I will settle for the Man Upstairs,\nwho might like some warning that I am on my way.\n\"Fear\nnot,\" the new joe says. \"This most certainly will\nnot be our last conversation. I need to go back to my people\nand spread the word of this new revelation, but I will be\nback to learn more from your wisdom.\"\nHe\nmakes an odd sort of bow. It seems only obliging to try to\nreturn it, but while my head is down, he disappears. Not like\nSergeant Mallory did, more like just turning off the radio.\nOne minute there is his voice; the next minute, all I can\nhear is the old judy still talking to her bag.\nThe\nbills are still on the table, however, so I gather them up,\nand start to leave. Debele will be very pleased. I hope. But\nbefore I go, I finish off his dessert. It is only natural.\nAfter all. Mindy's cheesecake is indeed very good. And even\nsomeone in the god racket must eat..\nBack\nto top","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20041128094100\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/aprjun2002\/oddsare.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/jcv09Dpy8rH80r2WUjydmPuLlyc.json","volume":3.0,"issues":1.0,"has_text":true}

I'm sure it didn't look all that far when\nyour Ma scratched a map in the sand, eh?\"\nCondescending or not, Theo seemed to know what he talking\nabout. He'd wanted one favor in return for a ride, and\nsince Abe hadn't seen many other boats offering rides to\nrunaways, well, here he was.\nTheo pushed a lever forward and Abe had to catch his balance\nas the boat pushed forward. The Atlantian glanced over\nhis shoulder again. \"All right, friend, to the task\nat hand. You're going to free Saint Domingue. I'll consider\nit a favor, as will three hundred thousand former slaves.\"\n\"But--Saint Domingue's already free.\" He said\nit like a mantra; it was this thought which kept Abe moving\nthrough fifteen nights of terrifying, half-starved flight.\nIt had kept him alive as he crouched in the razor-sharp\nreeds of the Mississippi Delta, fighting off leeches and\nmosquitoes by the dozens. Helped him set one foot in front\nof the other again and again when it seemed like he couldn't\ngo any further.\n\"Quite the contrary. You see, Louverture's little\nrevolt gained some time, but the respite's over. In three\ndays' time Napoleon Bonaparte's fleet--\"\n\"Who?\"\nTheo sighed. \"The French. In three days, the French\nare going to re-take that damned island. And the Actualists\ncan't have that.\"\n\"'Scuse me, sir, but I don't really follow. I didn't\nhave much learnin'--\"\n\"Of course not. We've got time to kill, so how about\na little geopolitical lecture? You won't understand a word,\nbut it'll amuse me. Rather like teaching a chimp to play\ndrums.\"\n\"Yessir.\" Once again, Abe sensed he'd been insulted.\nHe didn't understand this man at all; he professed to be\nAbe's friend, yet cut him down at every turn. Also, it\nseemed to Abe that his air of superiority hid something\nelse--like Theo had some bigger joke up his sleeve, and\ndidn't plan on ever revealing the punch line.\n\"All right. You see, Abe, only half the world's population\nlives up on land. My people, the Atlantians, have been\nliving on the ocean floors since your ancestors were first\nlearning to use their thumbs. We've a few thousand years\nof evolution on you, which is why our technology is so advanced.\nGot it?\"\nAbe nodded.\n\"Sure you do. So, Atlantian interests are turning\nquickly to dry land--namely, your mineral resources. We\nplan on colonizing the upper world within the next two centuries.\nUnfortunately, it's looking as though our French friend,\nBonaparte, may make quite a go at forming a global dictatorship.\nThat's simply not in Atlantis's interests.\"\n\"Okay.\"\n\"My party, the Actualists, believes that Napoleon has\nmade a grievous error. His twenty thousand men might be\nenough to take Saint Domingue, but we're ninety percent\nsure disease will wipe out whatever French are left after\nthe war. We've been monitoring the evolution of a new yellow\nfever strain in these islands.\"\n\"Yellow what?\"\n\"Swamp rot, to you. Gods, I can't wait for you people\nto develop real biology.\"\n\"Yessir.\"\n\"Problem is, some backward-thinking Atlantians don't\nwant us to come up for air, so to speak. Those are the\nStasists.\"\n\"Stasists. Yessir.\"\n\"Those dumb bastards want us to stay hidden. Conduct\nmore studies, they say, be more certain of the world upstairs\nbefore we emerge. Fools, I tell you. You people--Industrial\nMan, I mean, not Negroes in particular--breed like weeds.\nThe longer we wait, the harder, well, the harder it's gonna\nbe to establish trade.\"\nThe Atlantian bent forward to peer at a round slate of glass,\nupon which Abe thought he saw glowing letters. \"I\nguess I just don't understand, Theo, sir. Why would it\nbe harder to trade later?\"\nTheo remained silent for a moment. \"Did you study\nmuch political science, macroeconomics, out there on the\nplantation, Abe?\"\n\"Uh, no sir.\"\n\"Then take my word for it.\"\nAnger boiled in Abe for the first time he could remember.\nHe'd learned as a child to hold his tongue when abused by\na white man; it didn't pay to bite the hand which held the\nwhip. He buried the feeling reflexively, hating himself\nfor playing meek, but vowing at the same time that once\nhe lived free, no one would speak to him thus.\nTheo continued his lecture, oblivious\nto the brief battle played out behind him. \"So, the\nStasists can't muster enough influence to stop our plans,\nbut they do know that a French victory in Hispaniola--and eventually America--would force us to reconsider.\nThus, they've sent an agent to Saint Domingue. He's brought\nthe one thing that might change the course of the coming\nbattle. Can you guess?\"\n\"Uh, no sir. Maybe some kinda new guns?\"\n\"Nothing so blatant, Abe. Our friend has brought the\ncure for yellow fever, and he's given it to a French sympathizer\nby name of Jean Renault.\"\n\"I don't know that I follow.\"\nTheo spun suddenly, abandoning his controls\nto face Abe with eyes that glittered in the strange illumination.\n\"Laid out simply, Abe: an ex-slave, Renault, has the\ncure for yellow fever. When the French take the island,\nRenault will sell them the cure. They'll be able to establish\na permanent base on Saint Domingue, and from there they'll\ntake over America.\"\nAbe's mind reeled. He understood, but fought to disbelieve.\nHow could any man who'd lived as a slave help the former\nmasters reestablish their supremacy? It simply wasn't possible.\n\"I know what you're thinking,\" said Theo. \"The\nanswer is money. Our Stasist agent has promised Renault\nhe'll live like a king, after he betrays Saint Domingue.\nA man'll do anything, you offer him enough money.\"\n\"Not anything,\" said Abe. \"No man wants\nto be a slave.\"\n\"Nah, but he'll everyone else, if\nthe price is right. Think about it, Abe. Hispaniola's only chance lies in the\nFrench not getting that serum. If the fever gets 'em, Touissant\nand Dessalines will salvage what's left and eventually oust\nthe French completely. Saint Domingue will remain free.\"\n\"All right,\" said Abe. \"So what's it got\nto do with me?\"\n\"That's the favor. I need you to kill Renault.\"\nAbe stared. His jaw dropped open, but he hardly noticed.\n\"Think about it, Abe. If I do it, the Stasists will\nknow there was an Atlantian involved, and that'll cause\nproblems like you wouldn't believe. Besides, you think\na white man can kill a black man in Saint Domingue and get\nout alive?\"\n\"But--I can't. I can't kill a man!\"\n\"Not even to save a quarter million others? Keep them\nfree?\"\n\"But--\"\n\"Come on, Abe. Weren't you just telling me how God-awful\nimportant your freedom is? How no amount of money can buy\nit?\"\nAbe's jaw worked up and down, but he found himself helpless\nto argue.\n\"Besides, what're you gonna do when the French take\nover and set you to harvesting cocoa and coffee? Think\nabout it, Abe.\"\nTheo turned back to the controls, leaving Abe to his thoughts,\nbut the former slave knew deep inside his decision was already\nmade.\n#\nTheo set Abe ashore in the early morning hours, surfacing\na few miles from town so as not to attract attention. He\nhad to cut through a cocoa field on his way in; the sight\nof the neatly-ordered rows brought back unwanted memories,\nbut helped Abe strengthen his resolve.\nFinding Renault proved ridiculously easy. It seemed everyone\nknew everyone else on the newly-liberated island; at the\nfifth inn he was given the address of a more permanent boarding\nhouse. He also learned why the waking town was so quiet.\n\"The French, damn them to hell,\" said the innkeeper,\nspitting through rotted teeth. \"Been seeing their\nsails for days. Dessalines will try to keep 'em from landing,\nbut we lack the weapons for that kind of fighting.\"\nAbe thanked him, paid for his breakfast with money from\nTheo, and went in search of his quarry.\nHis heart pounded as he located the boarding house. In\nthe gloom of the Atlantian sub he'd been resigned to the\ntask; now, in the full light of day, the entire conversation\nwith Theodderick Minus seemed a surreal dream. If not for\nthe innkeeper's description of Frenchmen on the horizon,\nhe might have forgotten his strange benefactor entirely\nand disappeared into the island's dark populace.\nBut he couldn't forget the bite of the whip on his back,\nthe blistering sun and constant, gnawing hunger as he worked\nhis fingers bloody in the cotton field, day after day.\nCondescending or not, Theo's prediction of French conquest\nseemed as solid as his wondrous, underwater ship. Drawing\na deep breath, Abe pushed through the boarding house door\nand hurried up the stairs.\nThe door opened a crack at his knock, revealing a wiry man\nwith skin even blacker than Abe's. He was older, too, by\nat least ten years. His glared at Abe.\n\"Wrong room.\"\n\"Henri Renault?\"\nThe man's brow creased. \"Yeah.\"\nAbe shoved the door with all the strength his powerful arms\ncould muster. It flew open, knocking the smaller man to\nthe floor. Abe stepped inside and slammed it shut.\n\"What the hell? Hey, boy, what you about?\"\nAbe stared at Renault, who scuttled away like a crab and\nstood slowly, leaning against a small table for support.\nA rickety chair and a cot with a single blanket rounded\nout the room's furnishings; a bucket in the corner might\nhave contained either drinking water or refuse. A closet\ndoor on the far side of the room stood slightly ajar.\n\"Yo, boy! What you think you're about, crashing in\nhere?\" Renault rubbed a growing bruise on his cheek.\n\"I got one question for you, Mr. Renault.\"\n\"Boy, it better be one damned good--\"\n\"You doin' business with a white man? Strange white\nman, most likely, who wants you to do more business with\nthose French?\"\nRenault's eyes widened and a sick feeling twisted Abe's\ngut. Until this moment he'd held out hope that the whole\nthing was a put-on; he'd get here and find Theo was nothing\nmore than a crazy man with a crazy ship. If he had any\nlast doubts, though, they disappeared as Renault whirled\nand snatched up a skinning knife from the table.\n\"Wait--\" began Abe, but the traitor charged.\nAbe screamed as the knife sliced into his side. He threw\none massive arm around the smaller man's neck, felt another\nhot line of pain flare. Brilliant white spots blossomed\nin his vision; he couldn't see, but his free hand closed\non Renault's wrist. The traitor twisted in his grip like\na dying catfish, nearly tearing away despite his smaller\nstature. Abe simply hung on, terrified, hot blood spilling\nfrom the gashes in his side. His arm tightened in tiny\nincrements around the traitor's neck.\nSometime later Abe realized the other man had gone limp\nin his hands. The room was strangely quiet; his own labored\nbreathing was the only sound. Renault's body hit the floor\nwith a soft thud and the knife clattered out of the dead\nman's grip. For a moment, Abe thought he would puke all\nover the floor. He rushed for the bucket in the corner,\nbut his dry heaves served only to re-ignite the pain in\nhis side.\nHe found Renault's spare shirt in the closet and used it\nas a crude bandage for his side. He also found four wooden\ncrates full of what must be the yellow fever antidote.\nIt came in thick, brown bottles, each stopped by a mushroom\ncork and nestled in its own little bed of straw. A dozen\nbottles per crate--he marveled that something so small had\nthe potential for changing the course of a war. The thought\nreminded him of his task, and he emptied each of the bottles\nonto the floor. The thin, colorless liquid soaked quickly\ninto the wood planks, leaving only Renault's body and a\nfew empty crates as testimony to the Atlantians' meddling\nin the world above.\n#\nBoth wounds had opened again by the time he returned to\nTheo. Sporadic gunfire boomed in the distance, but none\nclose enough to cause Abe concern--the small inlet where\nTheo had put to shore was far too shallow for the massive,\nFrench warships. Abe stepped out to where the water lapped\nat smooth-sided rocks and waved until he saw the submarine's\nseeing tube poke above the water.\nThe boat itself surfaced moments later. Theo hopped ashore,\nnearly tripping over the rocks in his eagerness to hear\nAbe's story. His eyes flickered briefly to the former slave's\nbloody side.\n\"Things got nasty, huh?\"\n\"Yessir. He tooked a knife to me, and I had to snap\nhis neck.\"\n\"Well, we'll get you fixed up soon enough. Did you\nfind the serum as well?\"\n\"Yessir. Poured it out, very last drop.\"\n\"Excellent! I knew you were the man for the job!\"\nTheo actually rubbed his hands with glee. Abe watched with\na detached feeling. He wasn't nearly as proud as the Atlantian.\nHe'd killed a man. Done it in self-defense, but then again,\nhe wouldn't have needed any defending if he hadn't gone\nto Renault's room in the first place. His only solace was\nthe thought that he'd saved countless others from a return\nto slavery.\nTheo was still crowing their victory, speaking half to Abe,\nhalf to himself. \"This is perfect, perfect. The Stasists\ndon't have another trump card to play; once the French are\ncompletely run out, we'll be able to move forward.\"\nHe clapped Abe on the shoulder. \"My friend, I'm gonna\nremember this when we're dragging this pitiful world into\nthe Technology Age. Hell, with the resources you people\nhave access to up here--how'd you like to supervise your\nown copper mine, Abe?\" Still talking, he splashed\nhappily back toward the sub.\nThat niggling seed, the joke Abe had thought he'd heard\nbehind Theo's words, finally swam into focus. He knew with\nsudden certainty what the missing piece of Theo's predicted\nfuture truly was. Rushing forward, he caught the Atlantian\njust as he lifted a foot into the submarine's hatch.\n\"I don't wanna be any man's slave,\" he said, as\nhis elbow tightened around the smaller man's neck. Theo\ngasped, kicked and scrabbled, but he was no match for the\npowerful, scarred arms. \"Not the cotton man's, not\nthe French--and not yours.\"\nIt was far easier the second time, but Abe still sat wearily\non the hull of the steel and brass boat as Theo's body floated\nnext to the hatch. He stared at his hands, wondering if\nthey'd ever be used for good, wholesome work.\nThen, as the distant gunfire increased to an all-out barrage,\nhe forced himself upright and turned back toward the town.\nKilling Theodderick Minus wouldn't stop the Atlantians,\nhe knew, but it might delay them a little. Long enough\nfor men like Touissant and Dessalines to prepare for their\ncoming. They wouldn't let their peoples' hard-won freedom\nslip away, and neither would Abe.\nOne hand clamped over his bleeding side, he put one foot\nin front of the other and set off for town.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050727004221\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/octdec2003\/masters.htm","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/oFqEKMYOqrWx22domc3KR78zQrs.json","volume":4.0,"issues":4.0,"has_text":true}

Yes, for even though it was early summer, arguments were abounding\neverywhere concerning whether the new century would begin on the first day of\nthe new year or whether celebrations should not be properly postponed until the\nnext year. Hopefully, this argument has now been concluded to everyone\u2019s\nsatisfaction and need not trouble us when the century turns again!\nI\nhadn\u2019t been to see my old friend Professor Megastrom for some time, so, having\nlittle to occupy me one sunny Tuesday afternoon, I decided to pay a visit. I\nalways enjoyed seeing what my old friend was up to for he had a highly inventive\nmind and was always involved in something fascinating.\nThrush\nmet me at the door. Although the term manservant is not held in such high favor\nas formerly, there was no other way\nto describe Thrush. He was far more than a butler. He could easily have\ncommanded a much higher salary elsewhere, but he had stayed with the Professor\nfor more than twenty years now.\nSuch loyalty is even more amazing when you consider how many times Thrush has\ncome to some sort of grief as the result of the Professor\u2019s experiments.\n\u201cHas\nthe old boy got anything hot going on right now?\u201d\nThrush\ngave me a look of infinite sorrow and allowed a small moan of purest forgiving\nto escape his lips. \u201cYou would not believe me if I told you, sir.\u201d\nI\nrubbed my hands together briskly. This promised to be more fun than when the\nProfessor invented the cure for the common cold and Thrush was granted the honor\nof being guinea pig. Thinking of that unfortunate episode, I sneaked a\nsurreptitious glance at Thrush\u2019s backside as he led me to the Professor\u2019s\nbasement laboratory. I noticed a small bulge at the back of his trousers that\neven his butler\u2019s uniform couldn\u2019t cover. So the Professor\u2019s assurances\nhad been wrong and the tail had been permanent. Poor Thrush!\nThe\nProfessor poured me a drink of his own invention. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting\ncompound of caffeine, alcohol and opium,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt makes you\nmellow, alert and imaginative all at once.\u201d I stared down into the muddy gray\nmixture and noticed some large lumps floating in it.\n\u201cFascinating,\u201d\nI murmured, setting the cup aside. Of course, the lumps may have been a part of\nthe mixture, but I knew my friend\u2019s hygienic proclivities to be of less than\nthe first rank.\nI\nasked the Professor if he were involved in anything interesting at the moment\nand his eyes came a-glow with the curious, almost fanatical light that I had\nseen so many times before when he spoke on subjects that had gripped his\nattention.\n\u201cTime,\u201d\nhe said in a reverential tone, \u201cAnd money.\u201d\nAt\nthat moment, a curious humming noise filled the room. I looked to my left where\nthe noise seemed to be coming from and saw a bright glow coming from some sort\nof metallic box-shaped apparatus. A vague shape materialized within the confines\nof the box and began to sharpen and solidify. A moment later, from the machine\nstepped \u2013 Professor Megastrom!\nThe\nnew professor walked to the old professor and held out his hand. Megastrom\nreached into his back pocket, retrieved his billfold and extracted from it a\none-hundred pound note. He handed it to the new version of himself, who uttered\na brusque, \u201cThank you, governor,\u201d and retreated into the appliance from\nwhich he had emerged. He twisted some dials, the machine hummed and he\ndisappeared.\n\u201cMy\nGod, Megastrom, that man looked just like you!\u201d\nMegastrom\nfavored me with grin. \u201cThat was me,\u201d he said simply.\n\u201cBut\nhow\u2014\u201c\n\u201cA\nsimple exercise in time travel,\u201d he said as if it were nothing at all.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve\ndiscovered time travel. But this is incredible!\u201d\n\u201cYes,\nisn\u2019t it? I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not making much headway, though. So far I\u2019ve\nonly been able to make my machine go back in time about ten minutes at a\njump.\u201d\n\u201cBut\nstill. Even ten minutes\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIs\nnothing,\u201d he said airily. \u201cI want to go back hundreds of years, perhaps\nmillennia. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve hit a snag. Investigating time travel is quite\nexpensive.\u201d\n\u201cYou\nshould have no trouble getting someone to invest the necessary capital.\u201d\n\u201cAnd\nlet the news of this device leak out? The British\ngovernment would confiscate it immediately. And who knows what those\ndunderheads in the House of Commons would do with it? No, I have to get the\nmoney some other way. Fortunately, that problem is even now being solved.\u201d\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\u201cSimple.\nEarly this morning, I placed a one-hundred pound banknote in my purse. In a\ncouple of hours, I will step into the machine and travel back in time ten\nminutes. There I will retrieve the one-hundred pound note from myself. Then I\nwill travel back another ten minutes and retrieve the bill again.\u201d\n\u201cBut\nthat\u2019s not possible. You\u2019ll already have given the bill away the first time\nyou met yourself.\u201d\n\u201cOh\nno. The first time I meet myself is ten minutes later than the second\ntime I meet myself. So the second time I meet myself, I haven\u2019t given the bill\naway yet.\u201d\n\u201cBut\nyou have. Haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nHe\ngave me an enigmatic smile and I realized that his powerful brain had delved far\ndeeper into this matter than I would ever be capable of doing. The noise came\nagain and I watched in mystification as the Professor emerged from the machine\nand held out his hand. The Professor dug into his hip pocket, retrieved his\npurse and extracted a one-hundred pound note.\nThe\nnew Professor returned to the machine, fiddled with the controls and disappeared\nin a blue haze. \u201cThis is impossible,\u201d I said. \u201cI just saw you give that\nbill away. How can you have it again?\u201d\n\u201cBut\nyou see, I am traveling backwards in time. From the point of view of my other\nself, this is an earlier meeting than the previous meeting. So I hadn\u2019t given\nthe note away yet.\u201d\nI\ncouldn\u2019t seem to understand it. It wouldn\u2019t come straight in my mind. I knew\nI had seen him give the note away,\nand yet he\u2019d still had it. It didn\u2019t make sense.\n\u201cI\nwill collect the bill twelve times in a two-hour span,\u201d he went on, \u201cSo that\nI will then have a total of 1200 pounds. This I will give to my then-present\nself and then travel into the future two hours. Then I will travel ten minutes\ninto the past, at which point I will not have given away the 1200 pounds. I will\ncollect the 1200 pounds. Then I\nwill travel ten minutes farther into the past, at which point I will not have\ngiven away the 1200 pounds yet, so I can collect it once again. When I\u2019ve done\nthis twelve times, I will have 14,400 pounds.\n\u201cI\nsay, that\u2019s a lot of quid.\u201d\n\u201cThis\nI will give to my then-present self and then travel two hours into the future.\nThen I will travel ten minutes into the past and collect\u2014\u201c\n\u201cNo\nmore. I\u2019ve heard enough,\u201d I cried. My mind was awhirl with speculations\nabout an infinite line of Professor Megastroms meeting each other and exchanging\nnon-existent banknotes.\nAnd\nall the time I struggled to understand, my utter confusion no doubt apparent on\nmy face, he smiled that enigmatic smile.\n\u201cThinking\nabout time requires an entirely different way of thinking,\u201d he said. \u201cFor\nexample, people say that time is money. But that\u2019s only an approximation. The\nexact formulation is: Time equals money times the square of the capital.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s\nreally very simple,\u201d he said. \u201cT=m c squared.\u201d\nThat\nwas too much. I simply couldn\u2019t stay there any longer or I would have gone mad\nwith trying to understand how that bill could magically reappear in his purse.\n\u201cI must go,\u201d I said, and he seemed to understand.\nI\nwas stumbling up the stairs when I heard the machine hum yet again.\nThrush\nmet me at the top of the stairs with my hat and coat.\n\u201cHow\ndo you stand it, Thrush? How do you put up with his insanity?\u201d\n\u201cIf\nyou think one of him is bad,\u201d Thrush intoned solemnly, \u201cImagine two of\nhim.\u201d\n\u201cHorrible.\u201d\n\u201cAnd\nthe two of him arguing.\u201d\n\u201cI\nwonder you don\u2019t go mad.\u201d\n\u201cArguing\nphilosophy.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d\nhave to shoot him both,\u201d I cried and ran out the door.\nI\ngot drunk that night and awakened the next morning with a hangover. While my\nhead pounded and my stomach threatened to go out searching for new digs, I\nwondered if the entire episode might not have been some delirium brought on by\nthe overindulgence. That hope was dashed when I opened the Post to find\nThrush\u2019s picture on the front page.\nThe\naccompanying story told how he was being detained until he could explain where\nhe had obtained the approximately 200,000 pounds in one-hundred pound notes he\nhad attempted to deposit to the account of Professor Megastrom. Seems the clerk\nbegan to suspect something was amiss when he realized that all the bills had the\nsame serial number.\nPoor Thrush. I fully intend to appear as a character witness at the trial.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050903212707\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/janmar2001\/timeandmoney.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The Internet's Premier Magazine of Historical Science Fiction","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/CZIrPLfayZfTsPFslOMxsdN83pY.json","volume":2.0,"issues":1.0,"has_text":true}

Never begin an action without at least three\nescape options.\nHe felt for his forged passport, his Spanish seaman's papers,\nand the disguise kit.\nHe took a deep breath and then snapped his fingers.\nThe first explosion took out most of the ceiling. 25 people\nbegan coughing and rubbing their eyes through plaster mist.\nThe second took apart the podium. The fat one was on the ground\nfeeling for splinters.\nSilver raced to the podium screaming \"Saboteur!\"\nHe grabbed Don Juan, telling him he had a car to get him to\nsafety. The doctor bought it and went with him.\nSilver\nwaited until they were on the road to make the announcement.\n\"You claim you're intelligent, so I'll give this to you\nthesis-sentence style.\"\nThe doctor turned pale.\n\"You're American?\"\n\"Up to now, you boys have had control of the streets.\nI know the police look the other way when you send a Jew through\na store front window. But that is over. It ends tonight.\"\n\"Who are you?\"\n\"Your stab in the back.\nSilver took off the wig, exposing his white hair.\n\"Mein Gott. Loder.\"\n\"What?\" Silver was on the verge of punching the\ngood Doctor and then dumping him out of the car.\n\"What did you say?\"\n\"No you are too young to be him. So the experiment worked,\nbut the sentiments have gone awry. Pity. I guess environment\ndoes matter.\"\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\"You don't know do you?\"\nSilver slammed on the brakes and drove the palm of his hand\ninto the doctor's chest.\n\"While you're gasping for air think about the 123 other\nplaces I can hit. Tell me who this Loder is.\"\n\"Loder. Steiner Loder. Viking society. Your mirror-image.\"\nFootsteps were approaching-booted ones. Silver punched the\ndoctor unconscious just as the brownshirts were at the car.\nSilver opened the door into the first one. He got out of the\ncar to confront the second one, an older man.\n\"Loder?\" the older one said.\nSilver took his legs out from under him. A third one tried\nto hit him over the head with a blackjack. Silver blocked\nand broke the man's arm in the same gesture.\nHe stood over the older man who lay on the ground and said,\n\"Loder's gone over to the jews\" and vanished into\nthe night.\nThe tutors wouldn't or couldn't tell him anything. But he\nknew someone who would.\nMr. Mycroft had changed little. He was still obese and house-bound\nalthough now he had the excuse of old age.\n\"My boy, how are you? Come in and have some tea.\"\n\"No thank you sir. Experiments tell me caffeine is only\na temporary brain stimulant.\"\n\"Cocaine is worse. Never try it my boy. It is overrated.\nLet's see, the last time I saw you was-\"\n\"1916. \"\n\"Of course. But you aren't here to relive school.\"\n\"Observant as always.\"\nHe outlined what happened in Berlin to the old man.\n\"The Viking Society was basically a precursor to the\nBrown shirts. Loder, I believe, was their token professor.\nHe dropped out of sight before the war. Never photographed.\nWhy do you ask?\"\n\"He's my latest project.\"\n\"Has your father decided to unleash you on the world?\"\n\"No. Dad still wants me cocooned.\"\n\"He knows best my boy.\"\nAnnual\nreport to Dr. Malcolm Silver -May 3, 1911. Subject already\ncan read norse.\nThe\nsafe was ridicously easy to crack, but it took him some time\nto find the diary in the sheaf of paper.\nMay\n12, 1908-\"It can be done. But I must show that it is\nnot the environment but the genetics. I am leaving to prove\nit.\"\nJune\n1909-\"Found the perfect receptical for the seed. She\nknows nothing; she is merely an incubator. To prove my theory\nof genetics over environment I am selecting a birthplace filled\nwith racial filth.\"\nThe old man looked unhappily out of the brim of his pith helmet\nat Silver.\n\"Jonathan, you are not to leave again. You have an obligation\nnot to put yourself in danger until the appointed time.\"\n\"When is the appointed time, dad?\"\n\"Oh, events are moving in a way fortuitous to your introduction\ninto the world.\"\n\"But the world is a political place, father. It seems\nthat I am only half-prepared. Your standing order to all of\nmy tutors has always been never to discuss politics with me.\nWhy?\"\n\"Politics is inborn. I wanted to see what political ideas\nwould germinate in you on their own, unaided.\n\"Oh they have. I guess you could blame it on the vegetarian\ndiet, the lack of sausage, of manly meat-\"\nthe father looked up from the lab table.\n--\"I've become quite the optomist,\" the boy contiuned,\n\"I don't think that mankind is degenerating despite its\nlast military outing. War has its purposes. It reminds man\nof what he must reject. After all, we're really all the same-black,\nwhite, brown. Why should we fight each other?\"\nThe old man paled; his skin matched his hair.\n\"You know.\"\n\"Oh yes, dad. Everything. I always wondered why I was\nkept in a cocoon. All the athletics, the emphasis on combat,\nclean-living. Surrounded only by men. You wanted a warrior\nso bad you even let inferior races train me. Remember Lho-Han?\nHe didn't meet your racial qualifications, but he knew unarmed\ncombat, so I guess we could be pragmatic.\n\"Son, you're needed. The world is decaying. You have\na noble heritage. Your ancestors were Vikings. Do you want\nyour children surrounded by garbage? That will be the future\nif you don't change it.\"\n\"No.\"\n\"No?!! You owe it to me! I have given you everything!!\nYour very superiority you owe to me!!\n\"You're wrong about my heritage. I've done my own investigating.\nYou may be surprised. Mom apparently did not tell you everything.\nA drawback of the separate sphere I suppose.\"\nHe\nleft the old man with the diary-the diary telling of the woman's\naffair with the Jewish artist, of how she must never tell\nthe doctor, of how the doctor must think he is the boy's father.\nHe didn't have to go back to know what happened when the pistol\nfired.\nIt was your own fault dad. You assigned the forgery tutor\nto me.\nBack to top","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20051030131543\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/octdec2002\/motivatingfactors.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/9FcOfxQHC7SrOIUlpv3yFTCjN94.json","volume":3.0,"issues":2.0,"has_text":true}

With a brief burst of speed, she crossed in front of another hansom, this one with a proud young filly and stopped a moment to adjust her bonnet and unfashionably-short skirt. The blustery English winter wind snapped at hats and bonnets, fluttered skirts and watered eyes, but at least it kept the air cleaner than the mugginess of coming spring.\nSkirt adjusted a touch above the ankle and hat adjusted to an angle beyond staid, the young lady looked up at the small manse, searching the numbers painted artistically above the doors. She bit her lower lip for a moment, then turned right, her steps slow and measured. The packed dirt lane extended the cobbled street in haphazard fashion, the curb a mere rise above rutted wheel tracks. She picked her way cautiously. Hats were gallantly raised, but she took no notice, and even the shrill whistle of a hansom driver failed to attract her notice. A cloud covered the sun, giving the wind an edge it didn\u2019t need to spur her on.\nIn a few seconds, her pace picked up and less than a minute later, she espied the number she was seeking. Seventy-Eight Tassel Way, a modified Georgian with a narrow front, painted in white with forest green trim. The young lady nodded, hesitated, then burst through the small neat gate as if pursued.\nHer knock on the tall double doors was swift and light, muffled ever-so-slightly by her gloves. She fidgeted, glanced around, then saw the tiny placard in florid script: Murchison & Leeds, Phenomenologists. She frowned.\nThe left door opened and the two women appraised each other swiftly. The young lady, following her conclusions, straightened her shoulders and announced in a clear voice: \u201cI am here to see the gentlemen known as Murchison and Leeds, please.\u201d\nThe woman inside was slightly older than her visitor, dressed simply but well and carried herself with easy grace. \u201cPlease come in, miss,\u201d she replied, opening the door as she moved back.\nThe visitor entered, looking around in frank observation, removing her gloves and hat in swift motions.\n\u201cMy name is Abilene,\u201d said the older woman.\n\u201cOh, forgive me,\u201d said the girl, dipping her body in a brief curtsey, \u201cMy name is Elizabeth Reilly. I apologize for not writing an appointment with the gentlemen, but my need is urgent.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it is,\u201d smiled Abilene softly. \u201cPlease have a seat while I announce you.\u201d She motioned towards a small parlor to the right of the entrance, one with four overstuffed wingback chairs, a tea table with pot and silverware (freshly polished, noticed Elizabeth) and two low tables with books scattered atop them.\nShe thanked Abilene and sat down in the farthest chair, facing the doorway and entrance. Elizabeth glanced at the books, pushing them hither and yon to see their titles, sniffed a couple of times and then remained still.\nNot two minutes later, Abilene returned. \u201cPlease follow me.\u201d\nThe two women crossed the foyer, passing two modest marble statues that Elizabeth knew were hard to dust properly and entered a large office. In it were two men, one sitting behind one of the two large desks that dominated the room; the other standing at the leftmost of three tall windows overlooking the west grounds.\nElizabeth paused at the door. The room was covered with books along every wall, from floor to ceiling, except for the south wall which featured a map of the world, about eight feet high and twelve feet wide and a map of constellations of the same size. Her eyes swept down, taking in the carpet of fine weave, threaded with gold and silver hues in a pattern she could not recognize but that looked vaguely Moroccan. Or Asian, even. The desks were massive blocks of oak, hewn roughly but with great care to provide soft lines. Both desks fronted the windows, draped with silk and velvet curtains in soft burgundy hues. To the right of the door was a small writing table, covered with inkwells, blotting paper, assorted files and, incongruously, a statue of a fat little man smiling happily.\nFinally, the two men, who were appraising her openly. The seated man was balding, with a small head, vivid blue eyes and a short mustache that served him well. His coat was dark gray, his shirt a brilliant white and he had a habit of tilting his head slightly to the left, as if trying to see from a different angle.\nThe other gentleman was tall, wearing a long coat, light brown, over dark brown slacks and boots of the same color. His eyes were brown, almost black, and his eyebrows formed a strong line across a clean brow. His nose was sharp, but not thin, and his mouth was pursed in a tight line. His hair swept up from his forehead in a strong wave and Elizabeth felt an urge to run her fingers through it.\n\u201cPlease be seated,\u201d said the seated man, rising to come out from behind the desk and offer her one of the three chairs for visitors. Elizabeth noted they were all different, carved of some ebon wood with figures writhing along the armrests and legs. Up close, Elizabeth noted the man had excellent skin and well-proportioned features. She sat down, primly, more on the edge than in the chair.\n\u201cDoes the chair bother you?\u201d The man at the window was staring at her intently.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she replied, and stopped herself from squirming. The man nodded, as if she\u2019d confirmed the origin of the Nile.\n\u201cHow may we help you?\u201d asked the man behind the desk. \u201dI\u2019m Leeds and this is Murchison,\u201d he added, waving a hand at his partner.\nElizabeth opened her mouth, then glanced behind her to note that Abilene was seated at the writing table, pen in hand. \u201cMy confidential secretary,\u201d said Leeds, \u201cAbsolutely trustworthy, I assure you.\u201d\nThe girl\u2019s head turned again and her eyes sought Abilene\u2019s. A strong look happened in an instant, and Elizabeth turned back.\n\u201cShe\u2019s your wife.\u201d\nLeeds started, while Murchison snorted softly. \u201cWhy, yes, uh, she is\u2026as you say.\u201d\nFirmer now: \u201cThen say so, Mr. Leeds. I daresay the lady prefers that term over the one you are accustomed to using.\u201d She sat back in the chair.\nLeeds looked over at Abilene, his mouth working in slight motions. \u201cI\u2026didn\u2019t know. I will, uh, amend my presentation.\u201d He shook his head, his shoulders twitching for a brief moment. Murchison grumbled some low words and Leeds nodded, a bleak smile covering his lips, one he shared in brighter fashion with Abilene. \u201cYou could have told me, dear,\u201d he said gently. Another soft snort from Murchison.\n\u201cI daresay the lady may have, plenty of times,\u201d barged Elizabeth. \u201cIt must be that the lady was too polite to correct you in front of clients and thought too little of it to bring it up othertimes,\u201d she concluded with a sharp tiny nod.\nLeeds smiled, his head waving side to side. \u201cVery well, I have seen the light and shall correct my erroneous ways.\u201d He clasped his hands in a swift motion. \u201cNow, is there some way we can of service to you?\u201d\nMurchison perched his hip on Leeds\u2019 desk. Elizabeth noted how long his legs were and then took a deep breath. \u201cMy missus is seeing elves,\u201d she blurted in a tight voice.\nNot a single gesture from the three listeners. Elizabeth glanced around and filled the void herself. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019m the lady-in-waiting of\u2014 well\u2026 My mistress is well-known, she comes from a good family and suddenly, in the past two weeks, she\u2019s been talking about seeing elves.\u201d She wrung her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point where she didna sleep at night and she locks herself in her room all day and won\u2019t let anyone take her her meals exceptin\u2019 me and we dinna know what else to do!\u201d she rushed to state, her Queen\u2019s English fading under pressure.\nMurchison: \u201cWhere does she see these elves?\u201d\nElizabeth waved a hand. \u201cIn her room. And sometimes outside the window\u201d\n\u201cHer room? Then why does she stay locked in there? Is she afraid of them?\u201d asked Leeds.\n\u201cOh yes! Terrified she is of them!\u201d stated the girl emphatically.\n\u201cThen why stay in her room? Why doesn\u2019t she leave for the country, say?\u201d probed Leeds.\n\u201cShe says she can\u2019t! She says the elves have told her that if she leaves the house, she will be brought back by force!\u201d\nMurchison glanced back at Leeds, shifting to face Elizabeth a bit more fully. \u201cCould you tell us how this came to be, up to your arrival here?\u201d\nThe girl nodded, looking down at her anxious hands. \u201cAbout two weeks ago, my missus was sleeping in her room when somewhat about dawn, she started screaming fit to wake the dead. I sleep in the room just off of hers and was the first one to get inside. She was standing next to her bed, wearing only her shift, the one with lace I knitted for her last Christmas and she was screaming bloody murder at\u2014\u201c She blushed. \u201cSorry. Me dad\u2019s a sailor.\u201d The men waved it away. \u201cI grabbed my missus and tried to calm her down but all she kept saying was \u201cElves! The elves! They want to take me away!\u2019 It was blo\u2014very awful to hear the child screaming like to die. The other servants and the Master and Lady came in and after a while, when the doctor arrived, we were able to get her back in bed and quiet. But the same thing happened the next night, although without so much bloomin\u2019 screaming.\u201d Elizabeth took a deep breath. \u201cAnd the same thing\u2019s been happenin\u2019 every night since, only the missus keeps getting\u2019 quieter and quieter. It\u2019s like she\u2019s losin\u2019 the strength to scream.\u201d Her voice almost cracked.\n\u201cDo you care about your mistress?\u201d asked Leeds.\nElizabeth flared. \u201cYou\u2019re bloody right I do!\u201d Her nostrils flared, patches of white along her cheeks making her gray in the morning light.\n\u201cYou are afraid for her? Very afraid?\u201d Murchison\u2019s voice was gentle.\nShe slumped back. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d asked Leeds.\nElizabeth\u2019s eyes seemed pools of soft despair. \u201cThat she\u2019ll kill herself to avoid seeing those elves again.\u201d\nMurchison glanced at Leeds and asked \u201cDo you think she imagines the elves, then?\u201d\n\u201cOf course!\u201d she practically snorted. \u201cThere ain\u2019t no such things as elves!\u201d The look she gave the men was part criticism, part incredulity.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t believe in elves?\u201d asked Leeds, deceptively mild.\n\u201cNo,\u201d without pretense of concealing her disdain.\n\u2018Then what is your mistress seeing?\u201d asked Murchison, sliding off the desk and sitting to Elizabeth\u2019s left.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d gasped the girl, \u201cWhatever she sees is\u2014it\u2019s jus\u2014\u201c. She shuddered, her face drawn and pale.\nThe men stared at the girl, her huddled figure a barrier to their questions.\n\u201cShe\u2019s experiencing more than just seeing elves, isn\u2019t she?\u201d asked Abilene.\nElizabeth\u2019s head whirled around, tears dotting her cheeks. \u201cHow did you guess?\u201d she asked in whispered awe.\n\u201cShe won\u2019t come out of her room,\u201d was the quiet reply.\nShame, mouthed Leeds to Murchison, who nodded thoughtfully. Leeds nodded to his wife, who continued the interrogation.\n\u201cThe elves, what do they do?\u201d\nThe girl started to cry, her shoulders hunched over in painful contractions. Abilene left the writing table and came to her side, murmuring softly. At a glance, Leeds and Murchison stood up and left the room, closing the giant door.\nIn the foyer, Murchison pulled out his tobacco pouch and Peruvian mahogany pipe, stuffed it with aromatic long cut and lit the shaggy mass with a well-scraped match. Two puffs passed before Leeds said:\n\u201cThe little men.\u201d\nMurchison nodded and puffed. \u201cIn a common pursuit.\u201d\nLeeds ran a hand over his pate. \u201cThe lass must be terrified, if they are doing their usual experiments.\u201d\nA grunt. \u201cAlmost surely. Her behavior is typical of the higher classes that suffer this type of intrusion. The question is: will we be allowed to do something about it?\u201d\nLeeds patted his pockets, then swore silently. \u201cLeft \u2018em in there,\u201d he indicated with his head. Facing Murchison, he said: \u201cThe Comte\u2019s daughter threw herself off that bridge.\u201d\nA puff. \u201cAnd the German viscount\u2019s sister and niece, they took poison.\u201d\nLeeds face twisted into a grimace. \u201cWhy can\u2019t they just handle it like the commoners do? You think that girl in there would jump off a bridge or drink lye to avoid the little men?\u201d\nMurchison pondered that for a second. \u201cShe\u2019d throw them off the bridge after stuffing them full of lye,\u201d he answered judiciously, \u201cBut then again, she\u2019s a sailor\u2019s offspring.\u201d He gave Leeds a pointed look.\n\u201cI get your point, Murchison, and if an apology is needed, please accept it from me. But it is part of the problem, this abhorrence of speaking of things physical.\u201d He started to pace the foyer, from statue to American painting and back. \u201cI grant you that being poked and prodded by little men is terrifying enough, but to try to keep all that inside just because of society\u2019s misplaced shame, well that just makes a bad situation worse!\u201d\nMurchison kept his eyes focused on the door. \u201cI agree, but the problem remains. The young lady will not speak of it, nor will her family allow it to become public knowledge if they ever find out. I\u2019m sure they know absolutely nothing of the procedures their child is suffering. That spirited girl in there came to us hoping we could help, and unless we find a way around \u2018society\u2019s misplaced shame\u2019, as you so well define it, then that girl will lose her missus and that family will lose a daughter.\u201d\nLeeds paused at one of the statues. \u201cCould it be something else? Dementia? Opium? A prank, even?\u201d\nThe puffing dwindled. \u201cOpium, I doubt. That would be handled within the family, with some story about the young lady being sent to the Continent for a visit with some barely-recognized aunt or uncle. A prank? If it is, it has gone way beyond the pale and is a matter of honor now, if not one for the police at this point. As for dementia, that\u2019s quite possible, and this girl has escaped the family\u2019s guard to come here.\u201d\nLeeds turned the statue a half-inch, then turned it back the same amount. \u201cIf it were dementia, Elizabeth would discard the elves and their physical actions. But she does not. She dismisses the elves and fully believes in what they do, for she sees the anguish it causes her mistress.\u201d\nThe door opened and Abilene, serene and gentle, called them in. Elizabeth was standing in front of the map, peering closely at the central region of South America. With a defiant turn, she spoke to them.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I cried. I have nowhere else to turn for help and I pray that you can provide it. I have explained to Abilene how you may send a message to me. And if you can help, I ask that you please hurry. I\u2019m afraid there is no time\u2026\u201d With a quick motion, she clasped her bonnet to her head, gave Abilene a brief hug, curtsied and left the room. Abilene walked her to the front door, exchanging a few simple phrases and then returned to the office.\nOnce again the men were arranged as before, Leeds behind his desk, Murchison perched on a corner of it. Abilene sat across from her husband, pad in hand and transcribed her own report as she spoke.\n\u201cElizabeth has been in the employ of Sir D\u2014 and Lady P\u2014 for almost five years. Their youngest daughter, M\u2014 , is but two years younger than Elizabeth, so more than being mistress and lady-in-waiting, they are like sisters. M\u2014 has three siblings, an older brother, an older sister and a younger brother. None of them, or their parents or the servants, has ever experienced the elves.\u201d\n\u201cAre they doing their usual activities?\u201d asked Leeds.\nAbilene nodded. \u201cYes, they start with a sudden appearance in the room, the quiet assurances that the person will not be harmed in any way while keeping their victim paralyzed, then a flying departure to a distant room where they\u2014do what they do.\u201d Even Abilene found herself shying away from the thought.\nMurchison rose and walked with long strides to the north bookcase. Reaching up to a blue leather binder, he opened it, flipped quickly through the pages and started to read: \u201cThe little men are wont to remove all clothing from their subjects and to inspect their chosen victim closely with their faces but an inch from the skin. Then they select a variety of instruments, some made of steel, while others are made of unknown materials and proceed to insert them in every orifice possib\u2014\u201c\n\u201cStop!\u201d cried Abilene. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what they are doing.\u201d She caught her breath. \u201cAs if you didn\u2019t know well enough.\u201d\nUnperturbed, Murchison replaced the binder. \u201cAt least this way, we are sure of what she\u2019s experiencing.\u201d\nAbilene glared at him as he perched again on the desk.\n\u201cCould the young lady be an opium fiend, or deranged?\u201d\nAbilene emphatically shook her head. \u201cNo. She is as healthy as spring and has never been anything but sunny. The past two weeks Elizabeth says, have tormented her \u2018til she is nothing but a shadow.\u201d\n\u201cA prank, by one of her brothers?\u201d\nHer glare at Murchison faded quickly. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. The older brother is with his Regiment up in the Moors, while the younger brother is but five years old.\u201d\n\u201cThe father?\u201d\n\u201cMy good man,\u201d said Leeds, \u201cSir D\u2014 is well above that nonsense!\u201d\nMurchison arched a heavy eyebrow and Leeds flushed. \u201cHe is in one of my clubs, and a more stolid character would be hard to find anywhere in the Empire.\u201d\n\u201cDull pukka sahib?\u201d smiled Murchison.\n\u201cOh, the dullest,\u201d laughed Leeds, then stopped quickly. To Abilene: \u201cAre you convinced the girl\u2019s story is true, that the mistress is being visited by little men?\u201d\nShe pondered, her eyes scanning a horizon far beyond Piccadilly and the metropolis. \u201cYes, I\u2019m convinced. Elizabeth has seen the changes in M\u2014and she speaks from the heart. There\u2019s guile in that girl, but she loves her mistress dearly and it hurts her gravely to see her in this state.\u201d\nThe office carried a silence then that oppressed the soul. The details of other lives ravaged and ended by the visits of the little men flickered in their eyes; the resolve to do something, anything, to dispel the fear of the unknown and the humiliation of their intrusions was evident in them as well.\n\u201cCan we go to Sir D\u2014\u2018s mansion?\u201d asked Leeds.\nAn emphatic shake of honey-colored tresses. \u201cElizabeth fears that her visit here would be discovered, and she never would have come if she knew you shared a club with her Master. Her suggestion was that, if you could do something to help, you send her a message with the stockboy of Jameson\u2019s Goods, who delivers vegetables and other goods to the house three times a week. He usually takes the items to the house in mid-afternoon, shortly before tea. She says he\u2019s sweet on her and so would never do anything to place her in jeopardy.\u201d\n\u201cBut how will we get into the house at night, much less into her room?\u2019 asked Murchison.\nA quirky smile wreathed Abilene\u2019s mouth. \u201cActually, I know a way that can be done,\u201d and her giddy chuckle made Leeds and Murchison feel a twitch of anxiety.\nIt took a few hours, but by just past noon, the uniforms were ready, the proper wagon was in place a few blocks from the Leeds manse and a cryptic \u201cWe shall help\u201d message, written on butcher paper, was on its way to the grocer-paramour. All that remained was the wait.\nMurchison passed the time reviewing the blue leather binder, while Leeds polished his Damascan dagger, legacy of an earlier adventure. At half past two, Abilene knocked on the door, pushed her head into the office and chirped \u201cTime to go!\u201d\nMurchison clapped the binder shut and thrust it back in its place. As the two men walked out, he said to Leeds \u201cI find her well nigh intolerable when she\u2019s playful.\u201d Leeds glanced over at his partner and grunted, whether in agreement or disagreement was not to be determined that day.\nAt precisely tea, the venerable firm of Smithers & Cavanaugh, Chimney Sweeps, parked its wagon at the gates of Sir D\u2014\u2018s estate, known to very few as Windale. The heavy wagon was topped by a twenty foot pole and a ragamuffin child.\nMurchison, or Cavanaugh as the case was at the moment, proceeded afoot to the entrance portico and announced his presence. The butler, a wizened figure of indeterminate age, made a brief noise of disbelief, but agreed to corroborate the story.\nMinutes passed, and Murchison spent them enumerating reasons why he would never have a butler. He was up to number eleven when the door opened again, only this time it was Elizabeth. She peered into Murchison\u2019s face and saw a Cavanaugh.\n\u201cWhere are the men who said they\u2019d help?\u201d she hissed.\nHe bowed, slightly, his canvas coverall a stiff garment in the best of times. \u201cI am Murchison, slightly disguised.\u201d\nAnother look. \u201cAnd Mr. Leeds? Is he coming?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d frowned Murchison. \u201cI am not about to clean your flue without his able and expert assistance.\u201d\nIt went past the anxious girl. \u201cWill it work? Can you really help the missus?\u201d\nIn a solemn, quiet voice, he said, \u201cMademoiselle, we will try our best.\u201d\nBiting her lip, she said, \u201cYou must hurry. The Master is due back at any moment and he will question everything. He runs a tight ship, he does, and can\u2019t stand interruptions!\u201d\nMurchison turned and signaled the wagon in. Within minutes, the tall pole was leaning against the rear frontage of the Edwardian-style mansion, and Petey, Smithers\u2019 second son, was clambering to its top as fast as his seven-year old legs could carry him. From the pole, he grabbed a second floor ledge and then squirreled his way up a drainage pipe to the third floor. Another ledge, a leap of faith and he arrived. Once atop the roof, he tossed down the light cord he carried around his waist and his Dad tied it to the heavy rope. With straining muscles, the boy hauled the rope almost seventy feet up to the roof, his father encouraging him every inch of the way. Petey then looped the hawser around the brick chimney, pausing long enough to look down the sooty hole as he always did, yelped \u201cCor!\u201d as he always did and then flashed a thumbs-up sign to the men below. Leeds and Murchison had discussed this when Abilene told them her idea, so with a sorrowful sigh, Leeds started his climb.\nIt didn\u2019t help matters that Petey, agile to the point of casting thoughts of monkey ancestry in his lineage, laughed and chortled at Leeds\u2019 clumsy efforts to shimmy up the thick rope. The heavy canvas suit created sweat even in the blustery day, and the snappish wind threatened to twirl Leeds around like a windvane. Finally, with reddened face, bloodied hands and trembling being, Leeds hauled himself onto the roof, lying motionless in his puddles of sweat.\nMurchison climbed up in about a minute, making Petey pause. The cord went down and brushes, scrapers, wire baskets and a lantern were raised in turn.\nThe dying day had become gray, and fog was making an early appearance. If anything, the men were glad, for it concealed where concealment was needed and the wind was slowing, making the chore atop the high gabled roof much easier. The boy walked over the rooftop peak, coming back when called.\nPetey dangled the lantern down the chimney and the deposits of charcoal and tar were quite clear. \u201cLooks clean ta me,\u201d said the boy. \u201cI ain\u2019 scrubbin\u2019 for no pay!\u201d he piped up, cheeks already sooty.\n\u201cYou will be paid the usual,\u201d said Leeds. Petey stared at him, the soul of a banker rising shockingly in the waif\u2019s dirty face. \u201c \u2019Alf now,\u201d said the little businessman.\n\u201cI thought we paid your father,\u201d said Murchison, trying to sound cross.\n\u201c \u2019Im too, but ya pay me first!\u201d an extended hand flashing out for emphasis.\nA coin dropped into it and disappeared. From below, Smithers called: \u201cTime to go, Petey! Get a move!\u201d\nWith devilish grin, the boy scampered off the roof, down the rope and plunged the last twelve feet into his father\u2019s arms. With a cheerful wave, they clambered into the wagon and started their return trip to the city proper. Petey couldn\u2019t resist waving his ill-gotten coin aloft, a badge of victory clutched in sooty hands.\nLeeds and Murchison watched as the wagon passed the elaborate hansom coming in, made a brief pause and then both continued their way.\n\u201cHe saw the carriage coming,\u2019 said Leeds.\n\u201cTimed it well, the scamp,\u201d replied Murchison.\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope the little men are not as clever,\u201d said Leeds, ducking back behind the rooftop, his eyes searching in the dying light for a comfortable seating spot.\nWith minimal movement, they unwrapped their food and an earthen jug of tea, quite hot to the touch, which lay nestled in burlap and linen. The vigil for the little men began in thoughtful silence.\nThe lantern cast very little light, enough by which to read the fobs they each carried. Conversation was limited to discussing options, as in for example, if the little men appeared in another room, or across in the East Wing. Or if their attempts to climb down to the young lady\u2019s room were impeded by difficulties with the rope, or rain.\nThe wind picked up, flailing at their face and hands as they bundled up in heavy cloaks. Clouds raced across the mottled sky, early messengers of rain. The moon was semi-circle of pale light, rising motionless over the Windale grounds.\nThe sounds of the house proceeded upward, from the ground floor to the second floor, where a piano played a few merry melodies and a lesser-known Beethoven sonata. Near ten, the sounds moved higher, just underneath the occupied roof, and by eleven, the entire house was still.\nWith half an hour of silence beneath them, Murchison crawled stiffly to the edge of the roof, lying flat upon the rough surface to peer down, scrabbling sideways a couple of feet until satisfied. He beckoned Leeds over, who silently cursed the cold and stiffness as one.\nLying facedown also, Leeds could see what Murchison had done. Directly underneath their position was a gabled window, and as they watched, the doubled-doors opened ever-so-slightly, and a hand flashed out once, a wave as invitation. Murchison whistled shrilly, startling Leeds so badly he nearly toppled headlong onto the pitch below. The hand waved again, slower, and the doors closed a touch, remaining open all the same.\nThey whispered. \u201cTime to hide, my friend,\u201d said Murchison. \u201cWhere would you rather be?\u201d He pointed to the secluded area of the chimney and back behind him to the more exposed, but still concealing, attic windows. Leeds pointed to the attic windows and without another word, they moved to their airy nests, and slumped in patience.\nIt made no sound, except that of a rustling wind. It came from the southeast, gliding as nothing man imagined could ever glide, so silently, with such massive presence. Leeds saw it first, a gray mass gleaming darkly with pale moonlight washing its curves. Murchison saw the change in Leeds face and turned slowly (Good man, thought Leeds vaguely) until he saw it.\nIt might have been spinning, or maybe its wan lights were rotating, but whatever it was doing it was done in dreadful silence. The ship, for it moved with directed deliberation, passed over the men, dipped slightly, then spun\/tilted until it was floating, without motion!, opposite M\u2014\u2018s window.\nLeeds felt the sweat in his armpits flow. No matter how many times one saw this miracle, it never failed to ignite fear.\nMurchison slipped his hand to an inner pocket, trying to control the trembling, like a tropical ague, that convulsed his muscles. The massive Colt, a gift from a very satisfied client, slid out. And the trembling faded.\nA deep blue light flashed from the ship to the window, changing color to a vivid orange for an instant, then becoming blue once again. Leeds crawled on his stomach, his mind yelping that the body that carried it should move in the other direction, in any other direction but towards them. He bit his lip to keep his mind at bay, and inched across the now-friendly roof.\nMurchison saw Leeds make his move and moved also, placing the gun up his left sleeve, handle out. With extreme care, to avoid detection and because the gun had no safety, he crawled as well, barely breathing.\nBoth men stopped when the blue light shifted hue and three small men appeared within the beam. They made no movement, but floated slowly inside the beam from the ship to the window. Leeds, closer and in front of them, could detect no difference in them, but he forced his mind to once again deal with the facts and began detecting unique features. The one on the left was older, or at least, had a more wrinkled complexion. The one in the middle had sterner eyes, a more direct and forceful gaze. The one on the right had pinched features, the skin on the top of his hairless head pulled downward, forming slight horizontal wrinkles. They were dressed in similar fashion: a simple tunic of medium-weight cloth, with a shiny surface and pointed shoes. Once again it struck Leeds how the clothes didn\u2019t belong where they were, as if they were shingles on a grandfather clock.\nMurchison could see the trio floating at a slight angle to his left. He watched as the little man closest to him kept opening and closing his left\u2026hand. He noticed it had three long, thick fingers, and an opposable thumb nearly as long as the fingers. He could see no nails and wondered if they could be wearing gloves.\nThe three little men floated out of view and within seconds, the light changed hue. Moving carefully but quickly, Leeds and Murchison reached the edge and looked down: the windows\u2019 doors were wide open, and mumbling could be heard from below.\n\u201cNow?\u201d whispered Murchison, more gesture than sound.\nAn emphatic shake. Wait, mouthed Leeds. Murchison clearly disliked this tactic, but limited his motion to pulling the large gun from its hiding place.\nSuddenly, the light changed hue again and the three little men floated into view. This time, the floating figure of M\u2014 was joining them, her pale ivory nightgown hanging well below her feet as she floated behind them.\nMurchison tensed, but stopped all movement when Leeds clutched his arm. Fall, was all he mouthed, and Murchison realized the grave error he could have made. His angry stare conveyed the need to do something, and as the quartet passed the halfway point, he knew what to do.\nThe next few instants were forever branded in Leeds\u2019 memory. Everything happened at once, and yet there was a definite sequence: Murchison leapt to his feet, pulling Leeds up and almost tossing him over the edge. As they rose, the light expanded, as if to pin them where they were. Murchison gripped Leeds by the arm with feral strength and launched himself, with Leeds as added weight, into the blue beam. The three little men turned as one, all of them to the right, Leeds noticed, as he and his partner fell swooningly, stomach lurching gasping wretching at the emptiness below\u2026\n\u2026.and then stopped. Caught within the beam, floating just like M\u2014, caught in the waking slumber of her nightmare.\nSeconds or hours later, Leeds opened his eyes. The box, for it was immediately recognizable as such, was clear, like glass. It distorted very little, and with roving eyes, Leeds took in s much as he could.\nWhatever light there was in this room was from an unseen source. It was dim, tenuous, with a quality of coldness that jangled the nerves. Directly across from the box was a large panel, covered with different surfaces, a series of instruments and buttons featured prominently, some of which glowed. One section in particular caught his eye: it showed Windale as if in a photograph, but with much greater clarity. And Leeds almost panicked when he saw the door of the photograph slowly close in response to what could only have been the wind. Funny how terror arose so swiftly from such a tiny source\u2026\nTo the left, a table, with\u2026a woman on it. Nude. His eyes darted right, mortification clawing at his throat. There was Murchison! Seated at the other side of the box, staring at him and then the nude woman. Leeds tried to regrasp his eyes, but failed. Behind Murchison were a series of doorways, two lit, two darkened. And in the darkened ones, things were moving\u2026\nLeeds tried to raise his arms, but found to his amazement that it wouldn\u2019t budge. Nothing was visibly restraining it: it simply would not move. The same with his left arm and his legs as well. He looked over at Murchison, who blinked quickly three times. I know.\nMurchison glanced down, then up at Leeds, then down again and up. Leeds wondered what he meant and followed his eyes down to: the Colt. It was still in Murchison\u2019s hand, his finger just inside the trigger. As he watched, the gun twitched. Looking into his partner\u2019s eyes, he could see the effort being made. Leeds suddenly felt tired and closed his eyes to rest, snapping them open when he heard a keening wail.\nIt was a horrible sound, wracked with despair, humiliation, pain and panic. One of the little men was apparently pushing something into M\u2014\u2018s\u2026 Dear God! Leeds could barely contain the fury he felt, every muscle clenched against the unseen hands holding him. His body, convulsing with rage, suddenly flopped a couple of inches, turning him fully in the direction of the lady\u2019s tormentors. The three turned as one, again, and stared at Leeds. By measures, his rage rose, then fell melting like a thin icicle beneath the incandescent glare of complete indifference the three little men were giving him. One would look that way at an insect\u2014nay!\u2014at the dried carapace of a long-dead insect. The void of rage became an icy-hot cauldron of fear. Abilene, he thought, maybe for the last time.\nThe keening wail resumed and Leeds felt his fear deepen. These were not little men in the forest, where Nature preserved freedom. These were little men in their own ship, and the tender mercies of Mother Nature had no place here. His thumping heart shivered in response.\nMurchison kept his eyes on the little men, the woman\u2019s pitiful cry a goading thorn in his mind. Agonizing, he forced his hand to move, aiming the gun away from Leeds in pathetic twitches, until the large-bore barrel was pointed at the tormentors. No thought did he spare to the wonders of science that surrounded him, nor to the puzzle of their capture and imprisonment. One thought and one thought alone roared in his brain: Pull the bloody trigger!\nHe saw it in his mind\u2019s eye, the simple action of inward pressure that would launch a lead slug across this stinking room and maybe amputate one of the little bastards\u2019 legs. Just one. Anything to stop them from hurting the poor child any more. He grunted with the strain of making his useless arm muscles work. His jaw was savagely clenched, teeth grinding fit to wake the dead. Eventually, like the rising of dawn on a feverish night, his finger closed on the trigger.\nLeeds refocused his mind on the panel. Whatever showed the house in the murky night wasn\u2019t a window, for the house appeared far too small. Had the ship moved away while they were unconscious? Yet the angle of the ship to the window was unaltered, or at least as far as Leeds could discern. Wouldn\u2019t it make more sense to have taken the ship high up into the clouds? A light flashed blue, then winked out.\nThen Leeds noticed that the cry had stopped. The three little men moved away from the table and began chittering in a series of clicks, snaps and the occasional hiss. Leeds watched them closely, trying to determine who their leader was. He noticed how they would ever so often stop their noises and glance at the young lady, then turn back and continue. They are trying to figure out how to kill her, thought Leeds, his whole body clenching in desperation. They look like guards at the scaffold\u2026His mind turned over. They look like\u2026like\u2026A rivulet of sweat ran down his neck as he put forth every effort possible into watching them, their moves synchronized frightfully as they once again looked at the girl, walked over to her, then moved away, as if a marching squad upon the parade ground, chattering like\u2026What the bloody hell were they doing?\nMerchants! Godblasted Arab merchants! That\u2019s what they looked like! Arguing price and quality and value\u2026 The little man with the penetrating eyes was trying to buy M\u2014! That had to be it!\nLeeds drank in their every move, every gesture, every nuance he could from their hairless faces to their spindly shoulders and their cruelly thin mouths. He knew he was right: their hands flashed fingers in different sequences. They may be from Mars, he thought, but fingers are always at hand. He actually wanted to giggle at that, but the horror of the moment weighed on him like a sodden blanket. Stop them! They had to be stopped!\nWith uncanny precision, the little men moved to the panel and with a quick gesture, one of them pushed some part of the panel and the house moved. Like peering through a telescope, the view of the house slid left, until another window appeared. A three-fingered hand reached over and tapped the blue spot that winked on and off earlier and the blue light began to shine on the window, just as earlier that\u2026night? The window popped open, and there, as if awaiting the moment, were two women, one in a nightgown, the other in a heavy dress.\nMurchison had rolled his eyes right as the little bastards had moved to the panel. Now they were out of gunsight and that anger also became fuel. A powerful surge became a measly twitch and now the gun pointed between the table and the panel. If they returned to that spot for another clackety-clack session, they would be in range.\nA ridge along the panel was stroked and the panel faded, a blue tunnel appearing that linked the ship to the house. The house was only thirty feet or so away, Murchison remembered, making the difference between the image and this view even more disconcerting. Focusing beyond the little men, who moved into the beam without moving their feet, Murchison yelled deep inside his soul when he saw who they were approaching. Abi-\n-lene! She was in the room with Elizabeth! Why? Why? No other thought but to move, move, MOVE!\nMOVE! Pull the goddamned trig\u2014\nThe blast was enormous in the confined space. The heavy lead slug tore across the cabin, slammed into the wall some three feet beyond M\u2014\u2018s bare feet and ricocheted back into one of the darkened doorways. In a second, a shattering screeching jagged noise was drowned by a low droning whoop, like a deranged loon.\nThe three little men turned, each in his own fashion. Their forward motion stopped, and at a clacked command, they floated back into the ship.\nMurchison was the first to discover his release, his arm rising of its own accord and pointing the gun at the returning bastards. He pulled the trigger once, twice and then again, aiming for their feet to keep the bullets from flying across into the bedroom.\nEach bullet spanged on a different surface, a spark or two flying off in odd directions. Murchison\u2019s arm trembled spastically, his aim so aberrant he was in danger of shooting everyone but his intended targets. With a curse, he got to his feet and swayed badly, almost falling over on his face with pure exhaustion.\nLeeds sprang up without the numbing fatigue and raced over to prop Murchison up. The taller man slumped heavily on him, mumbling one word. It sounded very much like \u201cAbilene\u201d, but Leeds dismissed it as his own fevered desire to save his wife.\nClutching Murchison as best he could, he glanced at the little men as they frantically tried to do three different things at once. The whooping loon was joined by a harsh buzz, a sound that froze the little men as if they had become statues in Leeds\u2019 foyer. Again as one, they looked towards the doorways, and this time, Leeds was doing the same.\nA nightmare entered what had dwindled to simply a bad dream. A massive beast, its hide jagged and cracked, lumbered into the room with menacing stealth. Its head, low-slung just above the floor, was deep with fangs and rending canines, slobber dripping between its front claws and hissing softly as it hit the floor. The legs were long, separated into two joints of equal length, and covered with thick scales that separated to reveal a dark oozing flesh. The eyes were pale orange, glowing embers of otherworldly menace. Where there should have been a nose was a quivering, moist hole, with tendrils that flicked out and waved mindlessly, slithering in and out with a sibilant rasp. Claws longer than a man\u2019s fingers extended and contracted and along the hideous beast\u2019s back were\u2026maggots, large maggots that waved blindly to and fro, dipping beneath crusted scales only to emerge again bathed in pus-like shadowed ooze.\nThe beast glided directly at the three little men, its jaws opening and closing with obvious zeal.\nLeeds yanked the gun from Murchison\u2019s hand and fired. His aim was true as the heavy bullet entered the pale orange eye, a geyser of ichor erupting amidst the frantic spasms of a beast gone mad with pain and impending death. Claws flashed and teeth gnashed furiously, maggots pulsing in sympathetic agony as the scales that protected them became bludgeons to tender flesh.\n\u201cOnly\u2026one\u2014left,\u201d gasped Murchison. Leeds grunted and dragged his friend across the room, away from the death throes of a sight he would never forget and over to M\u2014. She was still unconscious, praise Heaven. Leeds leaned his partner on the table and was gratified to see him brace his body on unsteady but functional arms. Whipping off his coat, he wrapped the young woman in it and picked her up. He lumbered under her limp weight and yelled at Murchison over the roars of the thrashing beast \u201cCan you make it?\u201d\nA shaky nod, a push away from the table and its alien instruments of torture and Murchison seemed ready to collapse.\nWhen Leeds turned, horror and bile almost burst from his throat. The beast, its skull shattered, one eye socket empty and burned from the bullet\u2019s blast, was back on its clawed feet and advancing upon them. Leeds tried to raise the gun, but with the woman in his arms he could barely do so. The beast gathered itself for a fatal final lunge\u2026\nMurchison swept the instruments off the table towards the beast, striking it with several. Falling forward, he yanked Leeds back onto the table, tilting him enough to bring the gun up to bear. \u201cFire!\u201d he bellowed, his chest shredded with the effort.\nLeeds pulled the trigger just as the beast recovered from its surprise. The bullet tore into its shattered skull, chunks of flesh and bone and sinew stained with bile exploding backward across its body, a shriek that would raise the dead in Hell ripping into ears that shrank from even the memory of that grotesque deathscream.\n\u201cRun!\u201d croaked Murchison, pushing Leeds upright and staggering himself towards the blue light tunnel. Leeds managed to bring the pistol around M\u2014\u2018s body and point it at the little men, who shrank back in unison. Even as escape made itself felt as a possibility, Leeds couldn\u2019t help but notice that in their eyes was a measure of\u2014gratitude?\nThey lumbered into the light as the beast spasmed then lay still. Unseen in all the motions was the writhing maggot that, propelled by the fatal bullet, landed on the edge of the tunnel and rolled\/ slithered onto the light.\nAnd from the darkened doorway, up along the wall and roof, a silent creature, patient in its years of captivity, made its careful trek along roof and panel\u2019s edge, until it too was poised at the border of ship and light, feeling the motions of its captors and the alien animals that had killed the evilest one of all.\nTo Leeds, the dash to the window was a marathon, a frenzied race of hours over a road that would disappear now and made every step a desperate negation of gravity\u2019s fatal grasp. The window never arrived, came closer as if in the worst of dreams, where the future one hungers for never comes, each step less an approach than a leap away from the angst-filled goal.\nMurchison\u2019s eyes sought the rope, the shrubs far below, anything that might help when the fall came. He was but a step behind Leeds and actually had time to think. When the light goes, I will lunge and push them. It was a futile thought born of chivalry and deep love, never to be spoken of.\nDays, weeks later, Leeds stumbled on the sill and pitched forward, his cry of alarm unheard by the three women. He barely managed to twist his body so that M\u2014 would not harm herself. A bright flash of pain in Leeds\u2019 chest was clear indication that his maneuver had left him injured.\nMurchison grasped the sill and slumped over it, his feet passing from solid perch to air in that very instant. With a gasp, he pulled himself into the room and turned in time to see the eerily quiet ship, its exterior as smoothly gray as ever, float swiftly up into the clouds.\nBelow it all, a meaty maggot plopped and writhed, pugnacious teeth digging immediately into the turf. And near it, a gelid mass felt the touch of life for the first time in the century and in its throes of joy, the hunger burst forth and took over. It raced away, gel becoming thew and bone.\nMurchison glanced back at Leeds and saw his friend lying on the thick woven carpet, his face a mask of agony. With as quick a move as he could make, Murchison went to Abilene, standing motionless and asleep and cupped her face gently in his hands. She slumped forward, almost knocking him down. With tenderness, he placed her in the large chair at the foot of the bed. He kissed her briefly, squeezed her hand and turned to Elizabeth.\nShe too slumped into his arms at his touch. He carried her to the bed, then collapsed to his knees in utter exhaustion.\nLeeds groaned. Somehow, Murchison found the strength to rise and lift M\u2014 off of his partner\u2019s chest. She too was placed on Elizabeth\u2019s bed. He stumbled back to Leeds and asked him how he felt.\n\u201cThrashed, and I have broken a few ribs.\u201d His breath was fast and very shallow. \u201cHow is Abilene?\u201d\nMurchison looked over at her, sleeping quietly, her face a marvel of strength, character and above all, beauty. \u201cShe\u2019s safe,\u201d he said, and their sighs, so much alike, were so different in meaning.\nLeeds passed out, the pain in his chest overwhelming his senses. Murchison lay down to rest, gasping for breath every time a new pain made itself known. His mind went over the events, disjointed and without much real thought. And yet, an idea emerged.\nPulling himself upright, his agony bringing nausea, he went over to M\u2014 and whispered in her ear: \u201cThe elves have left forever. And you are pure.\u201d\nTo Elizabeth, he whispered closely: \u201cYour missus is safe. Leave her now.\u201d\nTo Abilene, it wasn\u2019t very clear, but she smiled in the soft moonlight.\nOff the office in Leeds\u2019 manse was a covered terrace, where on warm spring days and cool summer nights, tea and cordials were delightfully enjoyed. Today was a winter day, but none of the three diners was willing to stay indoors, in any room, no matter its size.\nLeeds had his chest tightly wrapped and thus sat stiffly on the long wooden lawn chair. Murchison was huddled beneath a heavy coat, his body wracked with cramps and spasms. Abilene refrained from being too cheery, happy that her plan had worked and that her husband and dear friend (though she would deny how dear \u2018til Kingdom come) were safe, and that their mission had been a success.\n\u201cDid M\u2014 say anything about her ordeal?\u201d asked Leeds.\n\u201cNot a word. She was bright and cheerful and as good as rain.\u201d She glanced at Murchison. \u201cHow did you think of that?\u201d\nHe started to shrug then thought better of it. \u201cThey seemed mesmerized. I thought it could help.\u201d\nShe frowned prettily. \u201cDid you put any good thoughts in my head while you had the chance?\u201d She blushed slightly, to neither man\u2019s notice.\nMurchison harrumphed, a decidedly unpleasant sound. \u201cAnd have it die crushed by your own petty nastiness? I should think not.\u201d\nLeeds smiled. Abilene shot back, \u201cI shall stop tending to you, you ungrateful beast.\u201d\nMurchison shot a glance at Leeds, his eyebrow arching. \u201cOh pray that be true so that I may be freed of your watery broths!\u201d\n\u201cWatery?! How dare you! I hope you starve to death, you wretch!\u201d She snorted, very much like Murchison. \u201cBeast.\u201d\n\u201cTo your Beauty,\u201d mumbled Murchison, to himself.\n\u201cWhat do you think was in that ship?\u201d asked Leeds.\nThe day grew suddenly colder, though the sun and wind remained mild. Murchison barely shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. A zoo, perhaps?\u201d\n\u201cA zoo? You mean M\u2014 was to be placed like an animal in a cage?\u201d Abilene\u2019s face reflected a horror the men took pains to conceal.\nMurchison went on. \u201cI have thought of something else.\u201d\nLeeds nodded. \u201cSlaves,\u201d then it was Murchison\u2019s turn to nod.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cDear,\u201d said Leeds, \u201cSlavery would explain the examinations and haggling about as well as the idea that the ship was part of a zoo\u2019s procurement. Then again,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cIt could be something else entirely. Something we\u2019ll never think of.\u201d\nThe silence descended amongst them, their thoughts matched in darkness as the day faded to black.","source":"Doc file","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"This is the first in an installment of stories by Gil C.

That was what it called itself\non the shingle, newly painted in red and gold, that was banging\nabout in the wind and driving rain. Andersen threw open the\nshop door and, ducking his tall frame under the lintel, tumbled\ninward with relief. A bell tethered to the door jangled to announce\nthe arrival of the weatherbeaten customer.\nAndersen cleared his throat and swept off his tall hat, conscious\nof his dignity. For some hours now, grudging to spend cab fare,\nhe had wandered the rainy summer streets of London in despair,\nquite unable to find his way back to Dickens's city house, and\nthus far unsuccessful at communicating his problem to the passersby\nin his still-awkward English.\n\"Good day,\" he said to the man at the counter, but\nscarcely glanced at him, for his eyes were instantly taken captive\nby the shop's wares, stacked high along the walls of the warmly-lit\ninterior: O happy coincidence, he had stumbled upon a book shop!\n\"Good afternoon, Mr. Andersen,\" the proprietor said.\nAndersen started. Not just because he had been recognized; although\nhe had been having a relatively quiet visit with the Dickens\nfamily this time, on his first visit to England he had been\nthe toast of London society. But this London shopkeeper had\nspoken to him in perfect Danish!\n\"Are you a fellow countryman of mine, sir?\" Andersen\nasked him, quite excited and forgetting his streaming garments\nnow. \"You will have read in the newspapers, I suppose,\nhow I have been lionized here in England--\"\n\"I have read of it, though not in the newspapers,\"\nsaid the fellow, a sly glint in his eye. \"And no, I am\nnot a Dane, merely a man of--shall we say-- unusual accomplishments.\nI have been looking for you for some time, Mr. Andersen. Please\ndo come in and peruse the shelves; perhaps by the time I have\nthe tea prepared, something will have taken your fancy. I'll\nbe in the parlor in back,\" he said, and then left the polished\nmahogany counter to retreat down the center aisle.\nAndersen stared after the man. \"Wait!\" he called,\nand the shopkeeper turned around, an obliging smile and raised\nbrows on his lean, clean-shaven face. He was a rarity, a man\nas tall as Andersen himself, of indeterminate age, mature yet\nnot aged. Every dark hair was in place, and his well-proportioned\nfigure dressed in a suit of dark striped trousers, checked waistcoat\nand frock coat, unremarkable except for its crisp newness.\n\"Perhaps you have something in mind already?\" said\nthe man.\n\"Have you any Shakespeare?\" asked Andersen. \"A\nfine new edition of the sonnets would make a splendid memento\nof my sojourn in England--\"\nThe shopkeeper strode back toward him. \"Ah, no. Forgive\nme, Mr. Andersen, I have neglected to introduce myself properly.\"\nHe put a hand into his breast pocket and pulled out an engraved\ncard, which he proffered with impeccably manicured fingers.\nAndersen set his hat on the gleaming counter, then drew off\nhis damp gloves and laid them beside it. Then he took the card\nand read:\nThe New Curiosity Shoppe\nJas. B. Forward , Prop.\nPurveyor of Exclusive Books\nfor Discriminating Clients\n\"I deal only in new books, Mr. Andersen.\"\nAndersen was taken aback. \"Are there no recent editions\nof the great Bard, here in his native land?\"\n\"Not in my shop, no.\"\nSuppressing his disappointment, Andersen turned to survey the\nshelves. The heady smell of new leather hovered round him, he\nnoticed now, and the neatly arranged volumes fairly sparkled\nwith newness; their spines, some embossed with gold letters,\ngleamed ebony, crimson, rich toffee, velvety indigo and forest\ngreen in the glow of the gas lamps that punctuated the banks\nof shelving along the walls.\n\"The rebindings are my own,\" Forward explained. \"Some\nof the originals were, well-- not appropriate.\"\nThe New Curiosity Shoppe. But of course-- \"Then surely\nyou have the works of my good friend Charles Dickens, Mr. Forward?\"\nForward smiled and tapped the card still in Andersen's hand.\n\"Exclusive books, Mr. Andersen. Mr. Dickens's books are\nquite easily obtainable in many shops. My wares are available\nnowhere else. Nowhere.\"\nCuriosity Shoppe indeed! Forward withdrew to his parlor, leaving\nAndersen among the beckoning volumes. Pocketing the card, he\nbegan a slow stroll along one wall, his focus playing over the\ntitles that met his gaze at eye level. There were no divisions\nby subject, and there seemed no arrangement beyond the alphabetical;\nit was not so odd, then, that the very first author's name that\nsparked his attention was in fact his own.\nHis mouth fell open, and the back of his neck prickled. Hans\nChristian Andersen, the spine of the red book proclaimed, by\nElias Bredsdorff.\nSurely not one of those Bredsdorffs related to the Collins,\nwho were his own adoptive family? But how dare the man publish\na book about him without his knowledge and consent?\nWith a furious yank, Andersen extracted the book from its niche\non the shelf and opened the stiff cover to the title page. The\npublisher was Scribners, in America. For all the flash of the\nbright red cover, the good quality of the paper and its faultless\ntrimming-- from the look of the edges, there was not even the\nneed of a paper-knife to separate the leaves--for all that fine\nmanufacturing, the printer had made an idiotic error, giving\nthe publication date as 1975, instead of 1857, if indeed it\nwas newly published this year.\nHe made to turn the first page, then to riffle the leaves of\nthe book, and discovered the entire volume defective: the pages\nwere sealed tight.\nAndersen sniffed in annoyance; he was going to have words with\nthis bookseller and self-declared re-binder. But then he looked\nagain at the title page, and palpitations began to assault his\nchest as he sounded out the English subtitle beneath his name:\nThe Story of His Life and Work, 1805-75.\nAndersen turned smartly on his heel and stalked along the aisle\nto the open door of the little back parlor.\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" he cried, nearly knocking\ndown a coat rack as he brandished the offending volume at the\nshopkeeper.\nForward finished pouring boiling water into the china pot on\na little table, and set the kettle back on the hob before replying.\n\"Please, Mr. Andersen, do take off your coat and be seated.\"\n\"This is a monstrous farce--to dare predict the date of\na man's death!\" Andersen found his breath coming short,\nand his head was filled with a vision of Dickens's Scrooge,\ngazing in horror as the dread Third Spirit pointed its bony\nfinger at the headstone bearing Scrooge's own name.\nForward took the book from his now-limp fingers and glanced\nat the title page. He bit his lip. \"Oh, I see. Do forgive\nme, I really hadn't considered what a shock that would be to\nyou. Please, you must sit down and calm your nerves.\"\nWith trembling hands, Andersen drew off his greatcoat and hung\nit on the rack. As he sat down, the straight-backed chair creaked\nalarmingly under his tall frame. He licked his lips. \"Do\nyou intend to extort payment from me, Mr. Forward, to see that\nthis mockery of a book is not really and truly published? I\ntell you, you must surely have been misinformed as to the size\nof my fortune!\"\nForward's face registered astonishment. \"Good heavens,\nno!\"\n\"Then what can it mean!\" Andersen pleaded. \"These\ndates--\"\n\"Note the publication date, Mr. Andersen. This is a book\nthat will not be written for more than a century.\"\nAndersen sat thunderstruck. He wondered if he were actually\nlying abed with a fever, and if when he awoke this incident\nwould become one of his new stories. He sat staring in silence\na few moments, one hand on top of the book as it lay on the\ntable, and when Forward poured tea into his cup, he lifted it\nto his lips with the other hand, noting distantly that it had\nbarely steeped long enough to taste.\n\"All my books are like this, you see,\" Forward put\nin, his brow wrinkling with worry. \"I have a license to\nsell them under certain conditions, but this trip is particularly\nspecial, Mr. Andersen.\"\n\"But it doesn't even open!\" Andersen cried, setting\nthe tea cup down a little too firmly, so that the tea sloshed\nover the lip of the cup into the saucer.\nForward gently drew the Bredsdorff volume out from under Andersen's\nother hand. \"Oh, it can be made to open. Once we have sealed\nour bargain. But really, Mr. Andersen, I hadn't particularly\nintended this one for you. I have thousands of volumes here--\nbut of course, you will have no idea how best to choose a book\nfrom amongst these as yet unwritten masterpieces. Tell me, how\nwould you like to read a detailed and factual account of the\nfirst men to visit the moon?\"\n\"The moon!\" Andersen leapt to his feet. \"You,\nsir, are certainly nothing more than a mountebank. Good day\nto you!\" he said, and hooked his coat off the rack.\nHis host stood as well. \"Mr. Andersen, you astonish and\ndisappoint me. When I chose you as the subject of my little\nexperiment, it was because you of all writers in the Nineteenth\ncentury had--have-- the most fruitful imagination! An imagination\nwhich has attained immortality! From the viewpoint of many centuries\nhence, the name of Andersen is still one of the most illustrious\nin all of human literature! The world cannot get enough of Andersen!\"\nAndersen paused, the coat collar still in his hand. This seemingly\nsincere flattery tempted him severely, but he felt a ball of\nice forming in the pit of his stomach. \"And to what infernal\nagency do you owe your powers of prognostication, Mr. Forward?\"\nForward laughed. \"Oh my, no. I am no prophet. Don't you\nunderstand, Mr. Andersen? I am a time traveler. My clients are\npeople who are never content with the books they can find in\ntheir own era, and I bring them books newer than new-- books\nunwritten as yet in their day, but freely available in mine.\"\nIt took Andersen's breath away. He glanced again at the biography,\nhis own biography, written, if he could believe this peculiar\nbookseller, by a man not yet born.\n\"Surely this is all impossible,\" he muttered, looking\nround the seemingly ordinary little parlor at the framed prints,\nthe clock and china shepherdess on the mantel. He got one arm\ninto his coat, then turned an accusatory stare on Forward. \"Surely\nyou can't be telling me the truth!\"\n\"My dear Mr. Andersen, your savage Viking ancestors would\nhave thought your steam boats quite impossible too. But you\nhave traveled on them yourself many times.\"\nThat did it. Moving like a sleepwalker, Andersen hung his coat\nover the rack once more, seated himself at the table again,\nand took a slow deliberate draught of the insipid tea. His mind\nboiled like a whirlpool, churning up the myriad possibilities\nof the future.\nMen on the moon! Time travel! And who knew what else? Journeys\nto the miniature world he had once seen in a drop of water under\na microscope, and written a story about? Understanding the speech\nof animals, perhaps?\nThe bookseller smiled. \"Now to our bargain. Please don't\ntrouble yourself, my friend,\" he said, putting up a reassuring\nhand, \"I don't want money--your Nineteenth Century currency\nwould be of little use where I come from.\"\nAndersen felt uneasy again. \"Mr. Forward, I am not certain\nI want that book,\" he said, nodding at the biography on\nthe table. 1875. Dear God, am I really to die\nhe could\nnot say so soon, he could scarcely complain, it would be a longer\nlife than many had\n\"No man should be troubled with the knowledge of his own\nfuture,\" the bookseller agreed.\n\"But what is it you want of me?\"\n\"Ah, now we come to it. I did not exaggerate when I said\nthe world could not get enough of Andersen. Can you imagine,\nMr. Andersen, what you would give to see--for instance-- a new\nplay by Shakespeare?\"\n\"Dear Heaven!\" said Andersen. \"Why, Mr. Forward,\ndo you mean to say you have one in your shop? Name your price,\nmy good man!\" Dear God, forgive me, he thought, but if\nForward is the devil after all, how sore tempted I am to sell\nmy soul!\nThe bookseller smiled indulgently. \"No, I have no new works\nby Shakespeare. Which is a pity, because his works, like your\nown, are immortal. In fact they have had quite a revival in\nmy own century, thanks to the wonderful science which enables\nus to learn languages almost instantly, as I learned your Danish\nfor this trip. Audiences can now appreciate Shakespeare in the\noriginal, without the need to struggle with 16th century English--\"\n\"Dickens,\" Andersen interrupted. His head spun with\nthe view of the limitless world of the future that was opening\nbefore him. \"Is Dickens immortal too?\"\n\"Oh my, yes.\"\n\"Who else? Bulwer Lytton?\"\nForward cleared his throat and poured more tea. \"Pray allow\nme to come back to my point, my friend. I have no new works\nby Shakespeare--yet. Now, I am not entirely an altruist-- I\ndo make a tidy living at my business. Several centuries after\nyours, but quite a few before my own, I have a number of very\nwealthy clients who pay handsomely to read books written after\ntheir lifetimes. This keeps the business going--time travel\nis rather expensive, after all.\n\"But in my own century, you see, there is a fascination\nwith the past-- and those who are deeply devoted to their favorite\nauthors would love nothing better than a new work from one of\nthose authors. Thus my little experiment, Mr. Andersen. I have\ncome to see whether you will write a new story, which you will\npromise never to publish in your lifetime, and of which you\nwill give me the only manuscript copy. I will take that story\nto the waiting world of the future, Mr. Andersen, and it will\nbe received with unprecedented adulation by billions of readers,\non a dozen planets.\"\n\"Billions!\" Andersen felt faint. \"Planets?\"\n\"Not a word of exaggeration, my friend. In return, I will\nbe glad to offer you your choice of the volumes in my shop--\"\n\"Shakespeare,\" Andersen whispered. \"Is it possible?\"\nHe caught the bookseller's eye. \"For a new Shakespeare,\nI would not hesitate a moment!\"\n\"Ah.\" Forward nodded. \"But you don't know what\nyou would be missing! Irene Tallyman in the 24th Century, Chojun\nFunakoshi in the 26th--\" he broke off, looking at Andersen's\nface, then sighed. \"But of course, there are many even\nin my era who still count the Bard first among the literary\nlions. I can guarantee nothing, Mr. Andersen. But if we do succeed\nwith your story, and if indeed I can procure a new Shakespeare\nas well, then I promise, yes, you shall have a copy.\"\n\"Then it is settled!\" Andersen rose and wrung Forward's\nhand. He swept his coat off the rack once more and flung it\nround his shoulders. \"I will return next Tuesday, when\nI will once again be coming up from the country with the Dickens\nfamily. Good afternoon, sir!\"\nIn the street, the fog had finally lifted; Andersen found he\nwas at the corner of Paternoster Row and Match Street. He hailed\na cab and rode back to Dickens's city house, his brain seething\nwith ideas. It was no distress to him to return next day to\nKent with Dickens's sister-in-law and the children, while their\nparents tended to some business. Andersen had already begun\nto feel the sister-in-law and children did not care for him,\nbut now he was too preoccupied to mind, and retired early.\nHe woke before dawn feeling cold, so cold, although the weather\nhad turned mild after the rain, from a terrible dream of Death\nand Fate. It was quite as horrific as Scrooge and the Spirit\nof Christmas to Come; indeed Andersen thought he might outdo\nDickens with this tale, for the feared being that loomed over\nthe hapless heroes of his dream was a woman, that exalted creature\nthat should evoke the tenderest feelings of romantic love or\nof filial devotion, transformed instead into a figure of icy\nterror. Andersen threw off the coverlet, lit his candle with\na bit of twisted paper set aflame by stirring it amid the coals\nof the banked fire, and began to write at once.\nHe did not go to the barber for his customary shave, nor would\nhe come down to the family till the tale was finished. He then\nfound himself growing increasingly impatient with them and sorry\nfor himself until at last the day came to go up to London again.\nHe bundled up his pages in brown paper and tied them with a\nstring, carrying them under his arm and not entrusting them\nto the luggage.\nDickens and Mrs. Dickens were not at home in the London house,\nand so he was spared wasting time in greeting them. He left\nhis luggage at the house, muttered some excuse to the sister-in-law,\nand hailed a cab to take him back to Mr. Forward's shop. He\ndiscovered then that the card bore no address, but he remembered\nthe nearby cross streets and gave those names to the driver.\nOnly then, while he watched the varied citizenry thronging the\nstreets of this city of cities, did he feel the enormous weight\nof the thing he was about to do.\nIt would be like burying his story, never to be dug up till\nmany centuries had passed! To be sure, this way there was no\nchance of it perishing--and what a triumphant welcome it would\nhave upon emerging into the new day of the far future! As the\ncab rolled past a park, he saw some little boys at play with\na hoop and stick, and looking on at them a pretty young girl\ndressed in frills, clutching to her heart a fluffy pup with\na blue ribbon about its neck. They had no idea, those children,\nthat the famous Andersen was passing within a stone's throw\nof them, he whose stories had thrilled them as bed-time reading\nby their mothers or governesses.\nThe park fell behind as Andersen thought, not one of them shall\never read this tale. Though in truth it was perhaps a bit too\nstrong for small children\nAnd then the cab passed by a\nchurch, a festive party on its steps, a wedding it looked like--\na fresh-faced young lady in a white silk bonnet and lace shawl,\non the arm of a dashing fellow who tipped his silk stovepipe\nhat to the friends crowding round them with smiles and laughter.\nNone of them would know this story either.\nAndersen's heart began to pound, and the streets became a kaleidoscope\nof figures he could not touch: costermongers crying their wares;\nwhistle-blowing policemen; young ladies in skirts buoyed up\nby crinolines, bearing parasols against the sun as they took\nthe air with their chaperones; dark-suited men of business in\na hurry; rag-clad orphan children like he himself had once been--none\nof them would ever read the words now bundled under Andersen's\narm.\nThe cab came to a halt, and Andersen stepped down half in a\ndaze. Perhaps he would not be able to find the shop after all.\nBut he did. He stood looking at the spotlessly-painted door\nfor long moments, his fingers curling and uncurling around the\nedges of his package. Billions, Forward had said. Planets, he\nhad said. But how many centuries away was his home? How many\npeople, between now and then, would be deprived of this one\nlittle story of Andersen's-- all so that it might be a greater\nsensation when it appeared at last?\nBut he must go in; he had agreed to come. He opened the door\nand entered once again with the jangle of the bell, coming this\ntime from bright sun into interior gloom.\n\"Ah, welcome back, Mr. Andersen! Do let me take your hat!\"\nAndersen handed it over in silence, and Forward laid it on the\ncounter. Andersen followed his eager step to the back parlor.\nIn the warmth today he had worn only his frock coat, and he\nsat immediately on the offered chair. He did not remove his\ngloves, and shook his head at the offer of tea.\nForward's brows drew together, but then he fixed his attention\non the manuscript. \"So you have done it.\"\n\"Mr. Forward, I am having the most dreadful pangs of conscience!\"\nAndersen said, and proceeded to tell the bookseller about his\nmisgivings, fearful every moment of an angry outburst from the\nman.\nBut Forward listened carefully and gave him a calm reply. \"Let\nme set your mind at rest, my friend. The story you hold in your\nhands cannot be one that is fated for publication in your own\nlife time. I came here precisely to commission an entirely new\nstory from you, one that has never been known before. We have\nthe complete list of your works, believe me. Will you not show\nit to me, at least?\"\nAndersen's head swam. With reluctant fingers he released the\npackage into the bookseller's hands. Forward unwrapped it, while\nboth of them held their breath. Then as Forward's eyes fell\nupon the title, his jaw slackened and the color drained from\nhis face. Andersen's palms sweated inside his gloves as Forward\nread the first page rapidly, then began shuffling the subsequent\nleaves.\n\"Oh dear!\" Forward let go the paper, and buried his\nface in his hands, wracked with helpless, unjovial laughter.\n\"Oh my, but the joke's on me!\"\nAndersen sat stunned. \"A joke, sir? This is a most serious\ntale-- a dreadful tale! It deprived me of much sleep, and haunts\nme still with its ultimate horror and despair!\"\nForward breathed deep to regain his composure. \"Just so.\nThe Ice Maiden. But it is not in fact one of your very best\nor most famous stories, Mr. Andersen--perhaps because of that\nvery grimness. The point is, it is not a new story. It is one\nwhich you will publish a few years from now.\" Forward boxed\nthe edges of the manuscript leaves, folded them in half, and\nstood up with an air of decision. \"No, I'm afraid this\nwon't do, Mr. Andersen. My little experiment, alas, is a failure.\nAnd furthermore,\" he concluded, \"this is quite an\ninferior, rough draft.\"\nIn one swift step, Forward moved to the fire and laid the story\natop the coals. With a cry Andersen lunged from his seat, but\nForward barred his way, holding him off till the leaves caught.\n\"Please, my friend. Trust me when I say that the version\nyou eventually publish will be far superior. For one thing,\nyou must set it in Switzerland, when you travel there a few\nyears from now.\"\nAndersen dropped into the chair again, and stared at the manuscript\nas the leaves turned brown, then black and shriveled, like the\nlittle ballet dancer in his tale of \"The Steadfast Tin\nSoldier\".\nForward broke the silence at last. \"I am so sorry, Mr.\nAndersen. It seems there will be no more new stories from yourself,\nor Shakespeare, or anyone else. But I do very much wish to repay\nyou for your trouble. I did promise you one of my books. I will\nwarn you before you take it, it is so made that you will not\nbe able to speak or write of it in any way whatsoever. And when\nyou have finished reading it, after you turn the last page and\nclose the cover, it will dissolve into dust as if it never was.\nIf you are still interested, I will be delighted to help you\nselect a volume.\"\nAfter a long time, Andersen sighed. \"I so had my heart\nset on the new Shakespeare, Mr. Forward. But unless you have\na better recommendation, I cannot imagine anything more delightful\nthan the account of the first men to visit the moon.\"\nForward returned Andersen's wan smile. \"It is an excellent\nchoice, my friend.\"\nAndersen followed him out to the bookshop and accepted a green-bound\nvolume, after Forward passed a little silver device over its\ncover to unseal the pages. Then Andersen collected his hat and\ngloves and shook hands with the time-traveler.\n\"It has been a privilege, Mr. Andersen. I wish you pleasure\nof the book.\"\n\"And I wish you pleasure of your travels,\" said Andersen,\ntouching the brim of his hat.\nHe opened the door, ringing the bell once again, then hesitated\nbefore stepping out into the noisy London street. His hand still\non the handle of the open door, he turned once more to Forward.\n\"Tell me, Mr. Forward, have you made any plans to visit\nthe days of Queen Elizabeth?\"\nForward's brows shot up. \"One never knows\n\"\n\"Then if it would not be inconvenient-- perhaps you might\ntake my greetings to Mr. Shakespeare. I should dearly love for\nhim to read some of my fairy tales.\"\nForward broke into a broad grin. \"It would be my pleasure,\nMr. Andersen.\"\nThe\nEnd","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20051030133631\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/janmar2003\/newcuriosityshop.htm","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/jh7zEQcLuJ0Cbu6XnxIo0eFu8eg.json","volume":4.0,"issues":1.0,"has_text":true}

At seven-fifteen I took the ladder from the shed and set it up at the back of the house, climbed onto the flat section of the roof, and waited. The other guests weren't due to arrive before 8 o'clock, and, anyway, my butler would let them in and serve them with a drink. It was quite dark at twenty five past seven, and the sky was filled with stars as I stared up into the air, waiting for Patricia to arrive, not knowing quite what to expect. She had said she would land on the roof, and I expected that she meant just that, because she was not one to make jokes like that.\nI saw the light coming down towards me at about one minute before the scheduled time, and I watched it steadily as it descended and landed in front of me. A hatch door lifted up on the side, and Patricia appeared in the opening, elegantly dressed in her evening attire. I didn't show any surprise as I took her hand and helped her down the steps that lowered onto the roof. We stood there for a while, me still holding her hand, as we both looked at the craft.\nI can only describe it as an object like a saucer with its cup turned upside down on it. There were windows all round the saucer as well as round the dome, to give views all round, and upwards and downwards. Even as it sat there, it made a low-pitched whirring sound, like a water mill turning in the distance. The whole thing gave off a glow which illuminated the area of the roof where we were. I looked at Patricia enquiringly, and she gave a little smile.\n\"It's called a flying saucer,\" she said. \"You can see why.\"\nI gave a slight nod, trying hard not to show the amazement that I felt.\n\"Is this something the Wright brothers have developed?\" I asked. \"I have heard that they are working on other flying machines now that they have successfully shown the possibilities at Kitty Hawk, with those machines with wings. But this one is different. They really have something good here.\"\n\"No,\" she said, with a little laugh, \"It's not the Wright brothers' machine. This one landed in my back garden last week. I was in the house when I heard a strange humming sound, and the room was lighted up with a bluish glow. I looked out the back window and saw it there on the grass. The people were already getting out when I opened the kitchen door.\"\n\"Not the Wright brothers, you say? Who else is working on flying machines?\"\n\"Oh, many people,\" she said, \"but these were not really people like we know any. They were different, but yet not that different. Just different. You know.\"\nI half nodded to give her the impression that I understood perfectly, which was a lie, of course, because I was completely dumfounded by the whole episode.\n\"What did these men look like? I mean, what sort of colouring were they, and how tall?\"\n\"Actually, they weren't men,\" Patricia replied. \"They were women. They were generally shorter that I am, and they all had blue hair, and deep purple eyes.\"\nI stared at her with my mouth half open, and when she saw that I couldn't get any words out, she looked back at the saucer and said: \"They said I could use it for a while.\"\nThis was getting really silly, so I ushered her towards the ladder and helped her down. In any case, the sound of hoof beats on the driveway announced that other guests were starting to arrive for the party. When we joined the others, Patricia straightaway mingled with them, greeting one here and another there, always with that most friendly, welcoming smile playing around her lips. She was a real gem, always so willing to play hostess alongside my rather clumsy host at any of my parties -- which was almost regularly once a month. She was always elegant, but this night she was exceptionally alluring, as befits one who arrives at events in a flying saucer.\nIt was not until I managed to capture her for a dance well into the evening, that I was able to ask her more about her strange new means of transport. None of the others guessed that there was something immensely interesting parked on the roof, and I kept my composure so very well so as not to give any grounds for wonderment. Patricia, of course, just chatted, and smiled, and danced away as if it was the most normal thing in the world to come to a party flying in a cup and saucer.\n\"What do you mean they said you could use it for a while?\"\n\"Just that,\" she said. \"After I had invited them inside and entertained them with a cup of tea and a sandwich, they showed me over the saucer, explained all the workings to me, and said: 'Have a go. Fly it.' I was a bit nervous, but they seemed so confident that I could do it, so I did. It is really very easy to fly -- it responds to the movements of your body, but only when you intend it to. Lean to the left, and it goes to the left; raise your right arm upwards, and it moves upwards to the right; push back in your seat, and it slows down. It's really very easy.\"\n\"Where are they now? I mean the women who lent it to you?\"\nWe were still moving slowly round the crowded dance floor, keeping good time to the strains of a Straus waltz which had come back into vogue since his recent death. I say 'keeping good time', because I was hardly concentrating at all on the dance, so preoccupied was I with this thing on my roof, but Patricia was calm as always, and easily kept control over our dancing, while still leaving the impression that I was leading as I should have been.\n\"They went away. A second saucer followed us down at the end of my trial flight, and the women climbed aboard, waved goodbye, and the machine took off in the direction of Venus. Since then, I've taken rides in the saucer, but only at night so that no one would see me. I don't quite know what I would say if anyone asked me about it. But you're okay,\" she said, giving my arm a little squeeze. \"But I don't think you should mention it to anyone. I don't think they would understand.\"\nSilently I agreed. Not even to my butler who normally is quite imperturbable.\nAt the close of the evening, both Patricia and I stood on the front steps to say goodnight to the departing guests as their carriages came up to the front for them to get in, and we waved to them as the horses clip-clopped with them out the front gate. Then Patricia and I had a last quiet drink together before I ushered her out the backdoor. The butler, who was busily straightening up and putting dirty glasses and plates neatly on the sink ready for the kitchen staff to wash up in the morning, gave us a glance as we passed through, but allowed nothing to register on his face. I didn't quite work out what I would say to him when he saw me return alone -- not that he would ask or say anything at all.\nI climbed the ladder ahead of Patricia, and then turned to help her over the parapet onto the roof. She stopped beside me as I stood there for a long while just looking at this strange machine, taking in the detail of its smooth, pale grey hull and the white dome. Then, after a brief goodnight hug and kiss, she walked up to the saucer, the hatch lifted up, and the steps lowered to the roof -- she had not said a word or done anything that I could see, the machine just acted of its own accord. Patricia waved from inside, the steps lifted, the hatch closed, and in a moment the saucer lifted from the roof and I watched it rise into the air in the direction from which it had come. I stood there for a long while puzzling over this thing, and then turned to the ladder. That was when I saw my butler gazing silently up at me. He reached out to steady the ladder as I descended, then picked up the ladder without a word and took it to the shed. When he brought me my pot of hot chocolate before retiring, he gave no indication that he had seen anything, even though I knew full well that he had watched the saucer lift from the roof. That is the man he is -- I can trust him fully.\nAfter that very interesting event, Patricia disappeared for seven days. She had not left word with her closest friends, and everyone was very concerned for her well-being. You will understand that I was extremely worried because I was probably the last person to see her, but I could say nothing as the whole episode would sound so very improbable. Yet there was no evidence of any foul play, she had simply dropped form view. My butler did look at me often with a slight enquiring look, but he said nothing -- he wouldn't if I didn't raise it, and I didn't. What could,I say even to him?\nThen Patricia appeared again, as suddenly as she had disappeared. I heard the news, but didn't have any opportunity to speak with her until several weeks later when we had another reception at my mansion. This time, she arrived as normal in her horseless carriage, she being, as you may have suspected, one of the very first people in our circle to acquire one, which she also drove herself. The other guests required her full attention, so I didn't have much chance of conversation with her until we were dancing together once more.\n\"Where is the saucer?\" I asked her as we twirled round the floor to the strains of The Blue Danube.\n\"The saucer?\" she asked, drawing back from my arms to look me in the eyes. \"What saucer?\"\nJust for a moment I thought she might be joking, but then I reminded myself that that was not very likely, because as I said before, Patricia wasn't one to make jokes like that. But I was taken completely by surprise at her behaviour in response to my question.\n\"Last time,\" I said, \"You arrived for the party in a flying saucer. You remember? You landed on the roof.\"\n\"On the roof?\" She looked so genuinely surprised that I had to believe her, so I changed the subject.\nWe had a pleasant evening together, she and I, and we sat and chatted for a long time after the other guests had left. Then she gave me a hug and a goodnight kiss on the front step before she climbed into her automobile and drove off down the driveway.\nWhen my butler brought me my pot of hot chocolate before retiring, I started to ask him, \"Maxwell, last time Miss Coming was here, did you see her leave in the sau... ?\" But I never finished the sentence because of the look on his face which told me that he wouldn't want anyone to think he had seen a flying saucer, any more than I would.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050903212707\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/janmar2001\/saucer.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The Internet's Premier Magazine of Historical Science Fiction","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/QDLE9sBhesnq5XJbSQcvIgCv-is.json","volume":2.0,"issues":1.0,"has_text":true}

It\u2019s the people that make\nthe show legend.\u201d\nTomas considered this and took another sip of the ale that\nthe freak hunter had bought for him.\n\u201cSo\u2026 bearded women, pinheads, human worms\u2026\nwould these interest you?\u201d\nThe hunter laughed softly and looked around the room. The\nnext time he spoke it was without looking Tomas in the eye.\nInstead he kept his gaze fixed on the barmaid as she made\nher rounds.\n\u201cYour brazen manner of speaking is quite refreshing.\nYes, yes\u2026 the beard, the worm\u2026 these are pleasant\nenough distractions. But these are not what I am looking\nfor.\u201d The barmaid walked out of sight and he turned\nnow to hold Tomas in a stare. \u201cI am looking for an\nelusive creature. I have been in this business for a very,\nvery long time, and in all that time I have only found one\nunique example that has not been seen before. It is this\nthat I am searching for. That which has not been seen before.\n\u201c\nTomas shifted uneasily in his seat.\n\u201cAnd what have you heard about this village?\u201d\nThe hunter lowered his eyebrows and peered curiously at\nthe farmer.\n\u201cHeard\u2026? Why nothing. We are a travelling circus.\nWe do not seek places out, they seek us. Your villages and\ntowns are the solid and we are like the river that flows\naround permanence. We are always moving, ever changing.\nAmorphous.\u201d\nTomas did not know why the man felt like he had to talk\nriddles around him, but he also felt that he already knew\nthe secret here. That he was merely testing him.\n\u201cThere is someone\u2026 in this village\u2026 but\nI\u2019m not sure that they are what you are looking for.\u201d\nThe hunter leaned in, closer to Tomas.\n\u201cAllow me to be the judge of that. Who is this person\nthat you speak of?\u201d\nTomas continued, as though he had not even heard the hunter\u2019s\nquestion.\n\u201cTwenty five years ago there was a tremendous sight\nin the sky here. I was only ten years old, but I remember\nit well. It was like a firework display, happening right\nhere, in our little village. It looked like the kind of\nscene that you would get on the Monte-Marte, but it was\nhere. It was magical. It lit up the entire sky. Everybody\nin the village came out to watch. There was a blending of\ncolour unlike anything I had ever seen, no explosions exactly,\nit was like the colours were pigments, being mixed in the\nnight sky by an invisible hand. Remarkable.\u201d\nThe hunter feigned interest in all of this. In his line\nof work he had sat through countless stories of \u2018remarkable\nevents,\u2019 he always questioned the validity of everything\nhe was told. It was necessary. People had tried to sell\nhim every piece of gobbledygook that was imaginable. He\nhad seen animals that had had parts of other animals sewn\ninto their skin, had met castrated men who had tried to\npass themselves off for women, even parents trying to sell\nhim their young children as a midget. There was nothing\nthat the hunter took at face value. Everything had to be\nquestioned, questioned, questioned. Nevertheless, he waited\npatiently for Tomas to finish.\n\u201cThen, afterwards, the Miller\u2019s daughter fell\npregnant. No one in the town claimed responsibility, and\nthough she was beaten black and blue by her father, she\nalways denied having intimate knowledge of any man. Still,\nall the same, the Miller threw his own daughter out into\nthe street. She was taken in by others, and some time later,\nshe gave birth to a boy. But this weren\u2019t no normal\nboy. He was\u2026 odd. Right off you could tell that there\nwas something wrong with him.\u201d\nTomas trailed off and stared into space. The hunter sat\nthere, waiting for the story to continue, but it didn\u2019t.\nHe didn\u2019t really want to force it because he could\ntell where this was going. The boy will have died, buried\nin an unmarked grave, but this farmer would know where the\ngrave was and supply the hunter with a cobbled together\ngroup of human and animal bones. Probably the bones of more\nthan one animal. He had heard this before as well. Still,\nhe wanted to get out of this place, he could tell that this\nwas going nowhere, so he decided to prompt the farmer.\n\u201cAnd what happened to this unfortunate child?\u201d\nTomas blinked and became aware of everything again, as though\nhe had just woken from a dream.\n\u201cHappened\u2026? Why nothing happened to him. He\nworks at the watchmakers now, as an assistant. He should\nstill be working now even, he\u2019s usually to be found\nthere all night. I could take you there if you like.\u201d\nThe hunter did not know quite what to say, but what else\ncould he say?\n\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\nTomas stopped outside the shop. There was nothing to be\nseen from the fa\u00e7ade that would have told a passer-by\nthat this was a watchmaker\u2019s. There was no sign outside,\nor notice in the window. For all intents and purposes it\ncould have been a private house. There appeared to be no\nlight on inside either, making the shop look uninhabited.\nThe hunter crept up to the window and peered inside.\n\u201cAre you sure that he will be here?\u201d\nTomas nodded.\n\u201cAlmost positively. He lives to work. That\u2019s\nwhy he spends so much of his time here.\u201d\n\u201cAnd will you be accompanying me?\u201d The hunter\u2019s\ntone of voice suggested that this would be a bad idea, whether\nor not he picked up on this Tomas shook his head defiantly.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to excuse me, but I won\u2019t\nbe seeing him again. Not at night.\u201d\nThe hunter placed a hand on the bell and was about to pull\nthe cord when he stopped, remembering something.\n\u201cWhat name does he go by? I need to call him by name.\u201d\n\u201cHe is simply known as \u2018the assistant.\u2019\nAs far as I know he has no name.\u201d\nThe hunter did not know what to make of all this. If it\nwas an elaborate ruse, then it was one of the most well\nthought out hoaxes that he had been a part of. A less suspicious\nsoul would have believed everything at first glance. It\nwas all so authentic. But he still had his doubts.\nHe rang the bell hard. A voice inside called for him to\nenter. The voice had a soft, lilting quality, like crystal\nbreaking. He opened the door and went inside, without so\nmuch as a nod to the farmer.\nIt was cold inside the shop. Outside it had been warm, enough\nthat he had not needed an overcoat, but inside the watchmaker\u2019s\nthere was a chill to the air which cut through to his bones.\nHe stood still for a while, letting his eyes adjust to the\nlight. The surroundings appeared cluttered and he could\nnot clearly distinguish objects in this light.\n\u201cHello, who is there?\u201d he held his breath in\nexpectation for a reply. \u201cIs there someone there?\u201d\nSuddenly a match lit up the room as it was struck along\na wall and put to an oil lamp. Instinct pulled a hand up\nto shield his eyes. The light of the match seemed so very\ngreat in the inky darkness of the room.\n\u201cForgive me\u2026\u201d a voice whispered, \u201cI\nforget how dark it must be in here for you.\u201d\nHe looked up but the glare caused by the match had left\nthe bright shadow of the light across his eye and he could\nnot clearly see the figure. He blinked several times, but\nthat only seemed to compound it.\nThe figure fiddled with the setting on the oil lamp so that\nit was at the minimum gauge. The tiny flame flickered. He\nhanded the lamp to the hunter.\n\u201cHere, this will help for you to make your way through\nthe shop. Please follow me.\u201d\nThe figure started to wind his through the shop, weaving\npast tables and chests fluidly, moving as though he were\non wheels. The hunter followed behind him. He was quietly\nrubbing at his eyes in order to see this character more\nclearly. From behind he could make out that the man had\nnot a hair on his head, and he was wearing some manner of\ngown, or robe. However, what with the half-light he couldn\u2019t\npick out any detail. Then, he started to speak.\n\u201cWhat brings you here so late? We normally reserve\nour business for daylight hours, although\u2026 I have\nno problems with seeing you now.\u201d\n\u201cI am not here to buy a timepiece sir, I am here to\noffer a proposal to the assistant.\u201d\nThe figure stopped, but did not turn round. He cocked a\nhead slightly in the hunter\u2019s direction, but did not\nutter a word. He continued on his way. The hunter was glad\nthat he had made this impression on him. Up until now he\nhad been feeling quite thrown by this whole affair; he was\nglad that he could do some unsettling himself.\nThen, as if nothing had been said, he continued, making\nhis way finally to a workbench. Strewn across the face of\nthe workbench were the parts of a half-hunter that he had\nbeen working on. They were laid out in a meticulously ordered\nfashion, as though the parts of the watch had been blasted\napart, but still held the integral shape of the whole. The\nfigure pulled round to the other side of the workbench and\nbegan to tinker with the parts.\n\u201cI am the assistant sir. Mr Lanka, the owner, will\nnot rise until morning. I can\u2019t imagine that I have\nanything to offer you, I have no money, and I will not work\nfor anyone except that which is condoned by Mr Lanka. What\nexactly is the nature of your proposal?\u201d\nThe assistant busied himself, working away as he spoke.\nThe hunter could not help but notice that he had extraordinarily\ntapered fingers, they appeared to be marginally longer than\nlooked natural, and they swept their way amongst the parts\nas though he were gently conducting a symphony. He decided\nto begin his patter.\n\u201cSir, I come to you representing the Anair travelling\ncircus. I myself am in charge of locating and hiring new\nadditions to the circus. As well as this, I am personally\nresponsible for all my charges and will do my utmost to\nensure that no harm should befall anyone in my care. I can\noffer free room and board and a life that will be lived\nto the full. You will get to see the world, visit distant\nlands, meet a dazzling cornucopia of people. The world will\nbe yours sir. Your oyster.\u201d\nThe assistant had been moving continuously throughout the\nhunter\u2019s piece, but now, he stopped. The hunter could\nmake out the assistant blinking, despite the dark. It seemed\nto him, for a moment, that he could hear the assistants\neyelids wipe across his eyes as they blinked open and closed.\n\u201cI do not understand\u2026 I do not remember anything\nabout a circus.\u201d\nThe hunter felt more confident now, he wasn\u2019t sure\nwhat to believe anymore, but once he fell back on his routine\nhe felt comfortable. At home.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right sir, because you did not come\nlooking for me, I came looking for you. I have seeked you\nout because you have the exact qualities that we are looking\nfor and we would love to make you an offer to become a part\nof our circus.\u201d\nTomas had been right, there was\u2026 something\u2026\nabout this man that was compelling. The hunter could not\nput his finger on it, but he felt drawn to study his features.\nThe assistant possessed such pallid skin that it almost\nappeared translucent, it was pulled tight around his skull\nlike a death mask. Perhaps it was a trick of the light,\nbut the man appeared to have no hair whatsoever, by which\nhe appeared to have no eyebrows, or lashes, and the eyes\nthemselves held more secrets. They were ambiguous, mysterious.\nHe could not tell the colour of them, but they were hypnotic.\n\u201cA circus\u2026\u201d the assistant continued to\nappear puzzled, \u201c\u2026 but I have no discernible\nskills that a circus would appreciate. If I remember correctly\nthey would be places concerning acrobats\u2026 or clowns\u2026\nand I am neither of these. I don\u2019t know why you thought\nI would be suitable, but I assure you that I have no abilities\nthat a circus would be interested in. I am sorry to waste\nyour time. I believe you know where the door is.\u201d\nThe hunter was surprised at this rebuttal. It had been a\nlong time since anyone had shown a complete absence of interest.\nThe big top had always cast such a spell over people that\nthey clamoured for a place. It was unusual for someone to\nbe so short with him.\n\u201cBut sir\u2026 you seem to be missing the point.\nThe qualities that I am looking for are the ones that are\ninherent to you. I am offering you the chance to find a\nhome, to be amongst those who are the same as you, to put\nan end to feelings of prejudice and difference. That is\nwhat I offer.\u201d\nThe assistant looked the hunter straight in the eyes, for\nthe first time. The tiny flame of the oil lamp was reflected\nin the eyes that appeared to be one constant ebony colour.\nThere was no shade or iris. They were as black as the night.\n\u201cDo you believe my life to be one of unhappiness?\u201d\nAgain, the hunter felt unnerved.\n\u201cCome sir, you must have noticed that you are\u2026\ndifferent\u2026 from those around you. There must be a\ndegree of coldness in their behaviour to you.\u201d\nThe assistant moved closer to the hunter.\n\u201cMr Lanka treats me like a son. The people of this\nvillage know my skills. I am an excellent watchmaker. Everyone\nknows this. I am the watchmaker\u2019s assistant, and I\ndo not need to be anything else, neither do I have the want\nto be anything else.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026 how can you ever expect to be treated\nlike a human being\u2026 seriously sir, look at yourself.\u201d\nThe assistant pulled his head back. His brow furrowed almost\nimperceptibly, again, he appeared confused.\n\u201cPerhaps you would be happier if I my face was different\u2026\u201d\nAs he spoke the skin on his face began to ripple, as though\nthe hunter were looking at his own face in a pond and had\njust tapped the surface of the water with a finger. The\nassistant continued to speak:\n\u201c\u2026perhaps you would be happier if I looked like\nthis.\u201d\nAs he said the words the assistants face began to take on\nthe appearance of the hunter\u2019s mother, smiling at\nhim throughout the years. It was not merely a static image\nof her, it was as though he were seeing her throughout his\nlife\u2026 again. The beauty of her youth segued into middle\nage and finally, the skin began to draw tight and wrinkle\nloose. The final visage that he had cast his eyes upon,\nall those years ago.\nWhen the vision passed the hunters face was streamed with\ntears. He struggled to speak through his emotions, maintain\nhis dignity.\n\u201cA \u2026 mesmerist\u2026 sir\u2026 your skills\n\u2026are more than I could have ever hoped for.\u201d\nThe assistant looked confused again.\n\u201cI show you this\u2026 and it pleases you.\u201d\nHe spoke as though he were in pain. Then, his face changed\nagain. Whereas before it seemed to be like marble, incapable\nof expressing emotion, now it warped violently. He hurled\nan outstretched hand at the hunter. \u201cBegone!\u201d\nThe hunter found himself standing outside the shop, staring\ninto his own reflection in the dark windows. His face still\nwet. He looked around him. Tomas had gone, he was completely\nalone now.\n\u201cIntriguing. I will have to come back.\u201d\nThey quietly approached the shop. The hunter had chosen\nvarious accomplices because of their own particular skills.\nGregor was the strongman, and would assist with his brawn\nif it were called for. Simon was the \u2018frog boy,\u2019\nwith webbed hands, but he could be as quiet as the grave\nand so he had come too. Lastly was Pi-pi, a pinhead who\ngave out very little in the way of conversation, but who\nhad a penchant for locks, at this very moment he was silently\nand speedily working away on the lock of the watchmakers.\nHis hands flew about the task, elongated, similar to the\nAssistant working away on his timepiece. The Hunter would\nshow him exactly what sort of choice he had in the manner\nof joining the circus.\nPi-pi got the lock, there was the slightest sound of the\nbar pulling back into the mechanism and he allowed the door\nto swing wide. They stole silently into the shop. The Hunter\nhad prepared a handkerchief and a bottle of chloroform,\nin case the Assistant could not be swayed.\nAfter breaking through the doorway the protagonists held\nback and let Simon scout ahead. The interior of the shop\nwas pitch black, as normal, but his large, swollen eyes\nwere more able to see in this light than their own. Simon\npadded along, his bare feet sticking gently to the floor\nas he did so. The group scuttered through the shop until\nthey reached the spot where the hunter had had his discourse\nwith the assistant.\n\u201cSo where is this freak?\u201d\nGregor\u2019s voice was loud, even though he was trying\nto whisper. The hunter was irritated and was about to scold\nthe strongman when a voice spoke out from the darkness.\n\u201cI would appreciate not being called a freak gentlemen.\u201d\nA light came on from somewhere; the group blinked in the\nglare and saw the assistant standing amongst them.\n\u201cI believe that I have a choice here. I can choose\nto accompany you, which I do not want to do, or I can choose\nto protest.\u201d\nGregor stood there, looking to the hunter for a sign. Anything\nto allow him to do what he had been brought here for. The\nassistant looked at the strongman.\n\u201cYou wish to do me harm.\u201d\nThe thing man looked around at the group as the hunter poured\nchloroform into the cloth. He tried to ease the tension.\n\u201cCome now sir. We do not have to go about this with\naggression. We only want to offer you a better life.\u201d\nThe hunter smiled and stepped closer. The group took this\nas a sign and grabbed the assistant. The hunter placed the\ncloth over the man\u2019s mouth. He struggled vainly against\nthem until his body went limp. Gregor heaved the man onto\nhis shoulders.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t look special. Looks like Pi-pi.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong Gregor. The\nman has\u2026 abilities, things which set him apart from\nthe usual trade we deal in.\u201d\nSimon and Pi-pi looked at the hunter.\n\u201cPresent company excluded of course.\u201d\nAs quietly as they had come, the three men left.\nThe assistant was not happy with his new surroundings. He\nhad been placed in an enclosed room. There was one locked\ndoor that led out. Other than that the only feature was\na window, covered from the outside by a curtain. He sat\non the floor, looking around the room. Keys jangled in the\nlock and the door opened. It was the hunter. He beamed at\nthe assistant, like an old friend, and strode over.\n\u201cHow do you like your new home?\u201d\nThe assistant did not deign to reply to this, he merely\nmoved to ask his own question.\n\u201cHow long do you intend to keep me here.\u201d\nThe hunter laughed and made a dismissive gesture with his\nhand.\n\u201cMust you sully our agreement with these topics?\u201d\n\u201cAgreement. I seem to remember details differently.\u201d\nThe hunter carried a sackcloth bag with him, which he dropped\nto the floor.\n\u201cI have brought you your new outfit. We will open\nthis display tonight; you will be \u2018Mesmero\u2019\nthe hypnotist. To show my appreciation I am even leaving\nyou with some broken timepieces. To tinker with in your\nown time.\u201d\n\u201cI do not wish to play these games with you.\u201d\nThe assistant fixed him with his dark eyes. \u201cI can\npromise you that great harm will befall your business if\nyou maintain this charade. I give you the option of taking\nit back.\u201d\nThe hunter\u2019s eyes narrowed and he withdrew a knife\nfrom his pocket. He approached and placed the tip to the\nassistant\u2019s throat.\n\u201cThe hollow threats that you offer will be nothing\ncompared to the very real harm that I will bring to you\nif you do not \u2018assist\u2019 me, assistant.\u201d\nHe stepped back. \u201cPut the clothes on. Play the part.\nI will speak to you later.\u201d\nWithout adding any more he left the room, locking the door\nafter him. The assistant pulled open the gap. A top hat,\na cloak. The clock parts. He eyed them lasciviously and\nsmiled thinly.\nThat night there were more people than he could have hoped\nfor. There was an air to the festivities that told him that\nthe visitors were enjoying their time, and more importantly,\nspending francs accordingly.\n\u2018Mesmero\u2019s\u2019 stall had been open for an\nhour and people were flocking to see it. It was all running\non the word of mouth generated from just one hour. It was\nmore than he had hoped for. People could not believe what\nthey were seeing. The faces of those so dear to them, memories\nthat had been kept so private. As usual there were the sceptics\nwho tried to get to the bottom of how it was done. But this\ntime the secret was impenetrable. There was no secret to\nit, it was all real.\nThe hunter began to make his way to visit the assistant,\nto give him some stern words of encouragement. Suddenly,\na hand fell upon his shoulder. He turned to see the beaming\nface of one of the guests.\n\u201cI just wanted to tell you how much I am enjoying\nthe carnival.\u201d\nThe hunter smiled appreciatively, nodded in gratitude. There\nwas the chime of the bell tower. The hand tightened its\ngrip in his shoulder. The visitor spoke again, but the voice\nwas different.\n\u201cSomething terrible is\u2026 happening\u2026\u201d\nThe visitor\u2019s eyes began to bleed and she fell to\nthe floor. The hunter looked back just as the screaming\nbegan. The sound was immense, a tidal wave of noise. Chaos\nbroke out all around him. Everyone started running, screaming,\nthey were bleeding from their eyes, their mouths, their\nears. He could not comprehend what was happening. It was\nlike an apocalyptic vision.\nIn the midst of it all came a figure of serenity. Walking\ntowards him was the assistant. Dressed in the garb of \u2018Mesmero\u2019\nand holding a bizarre clockwork contraption. It looked like\nan open, half-sized, grandfather clock, but with too many\nnumerals, too many hands. Its pendulum swung with an ominous\nweight to it. The assistant did not move his lips but the\nhunter heard his voice clearly.\n\u201cI warned you of your course of action. I told you\nthat this would not end well.\u201d\nThe screaming had reached such a pitch that it was a wall\nof white sound.

I had to see you.\" Her hands worked nervously in the lap of her plain black dress, no doubt the best she owned. I have four sons. No, I'm sorry I've had four sons. Three of them--William, Hiram, and John have died in battle. Now my fourth boy, David, has been drafted.\" Her head fell in her hands. \"Is there anything you can do, Mr. President, to save my boy from the war?\"\nLincoln uncoiled his long body from the straight-backed chair where he'd been sitting and laid his huge hands on the woman's shoulders. \"Mrs. Davis, you've given far beyond your fair share to this accursed struggle. I will make certain your son is not drafted.\"\nThe woman took Lincoln's hands in her own, noting their size and strength. \"Oh thank you, Mr. President. God bless you, sir!\"\nWhen he was alone, the President bowed his head in his hands, and great sobs shook his lank frame. Three sons, he thought And I have lost but one, and oh the burden of that. A half a million sons dead in this horrible struggle, and so far nothing to show for it. Not a single great victory. How can I go on? Where can I find a general who will fight, and not just fight, but win?\"\nThere came a knock at the door, followed by a commotion in the hall. Lincoln recognized the voice of White House steward, Francis Johnson.\n\"Yes, Frank?\" Drying his sunken eyes, Lincoln stood up and went to the door.\n\"Sir, there's a man here who insists on seeing you, but I don't think..\"\nJohnson's words were interrupted by the brusque-voice of a black man.\n\"I've got to see you, Mr. President. It concerns winning the war.\"\nThe broad-shouldered black man, standing nearly as tall as the president himself, brushed aside the president's secretary. \"This is of the utmost importance!\"\n\"I'm sorry, sir,\" Johnson said, trying to wrestle back the intruder.\n\"That's all right, Frank. Let the man come in. And close the door, please.\"\nLincoln found himself facing a ramrod-straight Negro between thirty and forty years of age. Dressed in an ill-fitting black suit from which hands and feet dangled like a scarecrow, the black man stood unembarrassed, eyeball to eyeball with the president.\n\"My name is Kyler Treadway,\" the black man said, extending a shovel-like hand.\nThe president took the extraordinary occasion to shake the black man's huge hand. Not only was he surprised to see a free black man at the White House, the president was shocked to encounter a man of such self-confidence.\n\"What's brought you here, Mr. Treadway?\" The president remained standing on the off chance that he was dealing with a mad man.\n\"I've come from Cincinnati, Ohio, Mr. President. I've been a free man for seven years. In Cincinnati I own my own mechanic's shop. Quite a good one if I must say.\" Kyler Treadway spoke perfect English the president noted with surprise.\n\"Yes,\" the president said. \"I'm from those parts myself. It's rare to see a free black man in that part of the country.\"\n\"Some day it will not be rare,\" Treadway said without a shred of doubt, \"when this war is successfully concluded.\"\n\"Now there's a rare thing,\" the president said, \"a man who believes this sorry war can ever be won, for we have nothing but defeat and stalemate to show for two years of fighting.\"\n\"Which is exactly what has brought me here, sir.\"\n\"You propose to win the war for us?\" Lincoln drawled with a twinkle in his eye and the faintest hint of sarcasm.\n\"That I do, Mr. President, for you see I am not just a mechanic I am an inventor as well.\"\n\"Ah,\" Lincoln said to himself, \"just as I first suspected a mad man. Oh well I see enough of those on my general staff. Certainly no worse than the self-interested crowd with their hands out that are usually banging upon my door.\" He nodded with assent to Treadway to state his case.\n\"Let us consider the matter of infantry tactics,\" Treadway said.\n\"You are familiar with infantry tactics?\" the president said, raising an eyebrow.\n\"Definitely so, sir. Consider this. The generals on each side march their men in rows like sheep to the slaughter, presenting perfect targets to the riflemen of the opposing side. What say you to this? Suppose that an enclosed wagon were fitted out with steel panels to make it impervious to shot. Within the wagon there would be apertures where Union riflemen might stand without danger and fire at their opposite number.\"\nLincoln stopped Treadway with a hand raised to his chest, palm up. \"I don't suppose you have considered that the horses drawing the wagon would be shot dead in an instant by enemy cannon.\"\nKyler Treadway's laugh sounded like an empty barrel struck with a baseball bat. \"Mr. President, I do not propose to submit innocent horses to the gunfire of the enemy. I speak of a wagon propelled from the rear by steam engine in identical fashion to a train.\"\nThe president took his short beard in hand at the chin. \"Such a thing could not be built, and there are no rail tracks on a field of battle.\"\nTreadway smiled knowingly. \"Mr. President, such a thing not only can be built, but has been built, and need not run on rails. The torque of the engine will be used to power the turning of the wagon wheels, which will require no track. If you will allow me, I will have two such vehicles shipped from Cincinnati via rail and put at the disposal of your army.\"\nThe man is either insane or a genius, Lincoln thought to himself. \"And how much would the manufacture of such a vehicle cost?\"\n\"No more than the cost of a small railroad engine. I would wager that in mass production such a machine would cost no more than 800 dollars.\" The black man's wide nostrils flared with enthusiasm.\n\"I see,\" said Lincoln more carefully trying to assess the character of the unique individual standing before him. \"And I suppose as inventor of this machine, you would intend to profit handsomely.\"\nTreadway drew himself up to his full height. \"I would give the rights of this invention to you for your use without a penny expected in return. My reward will be the freeing of my people, for you see, Mr. President, I have a wife and three children still in bondage in the state of Georgia.\"\n\"I am gravely sorry to hear that, Mr. Treadway, and I do appreciate your offer.\"\nKyler Treadway seized the president's hand. \"Then you will accept what I have proposed?\"\n\"I will put you in touch with one of my staff who can facilitate the entire operation. Now if you will be so kind, I have other..\"\nTreadway rushed forward. \"Wait, Mr. President, there is more. Suppose that manned balloons were used to monitor the movement of the enemy, would not such a device be of value to our army?\"\nLincoln called out to Francis Johnson who stuck his head in the door at once. \"Tell Mr. Stanton that I will be late for our budget meeting. I am involved with an extraordinary opportunity to further the success of the war effort.\"\nFrancis Johnson saluted and closed the door. When the door was sealed, the president drew two chairs together in the middle of the room. Sitting knee to knee with the black man, he urged Treadway to continue.\n\"And what else has crossed your mind to further the success of our military ventures, Mr. Treadway?\" The president's Kentucky twang now rose in pitch for he had become excited by the ideas of this preposterous visitor.\nIn turn, Kyler Treadway's eyes suddenly began to involuntarily twitch with excitement in the throes of his emotion.\n\"Mr. President, I have one further proposal. It is rumored that the Confederacy has built an ironclad ship impervious to cannon fire. Such a ship could give the South an incalculable advantage in struggles at sea and perhaps even be used to subdue Washington itself.\"\n\"Yes?\" Lincoln chose to keep to himself the secret plan to counter the Confederate ship with the Monitor, an ironclad of a different design.\n\"Well here is what I propose to negate the strategic advantage of the Confederate ironclad.\"\nTreadway then outlined an idea so radical in its newness that the president was thunderstruck, for the black man was proposing a ship that would be capable of sailing under water and delivering torpedoes, undetected, to the soft underbelly of any sailing vessel.\nTreadway's words tumbled faster the more he spoke. \"Said torpedoes will be self-propelled, guided to target electrically upon firing from a ballast tube.\"\nUnable to decide whether he was speaking with a madman or a genius, Lincoln rocked back in his chair with a broad smile.\n\"Has it occurred to you, Treadway, that your vessel will sink the moment the valves open to fire your torpedo?\"\nBefore the black man could respond, Lincoln launched a story of a fellow in Illinois who had invented a device to deal with crazed dogs. The only problem was it involved inserting a packet of poison in the dog's mouth.\nTreadway laughed at that. \"I see you're saying it can't be done, Mr. President, but look--my vessel shall have a 900 pound torpedo-impulse system, compressed air banks to blow water ballast during resurfacing, advanced hydraulic system that will put to shame any mere railway locomotive.\" At each added detail, Treadway trembled with greater excitement.\n\"I must be kind here, Mr. Treadway, but what you are describing strikes me as trying to insert a no-barking device in the mouth of a rabid dog,\" the president replied. \"Besides no man would dare risk his life in such a machine even if something approaching it could be built.\"\n\"Mr. President if you would be so kind, I would volunteer to be the sailor in such a ship after I have built it.\"\n\"I couldn't allow you to risk your life in such a venture. Too many lives have been taken already.\"\n\"It would be the least I could do to further the cause of my people,\" Treadway replied.\nLincoln stood up. \"In that case I will take your offer under advisement, Mr. Treadway, and now if you will allow me, I will make arrangements for you to go forward in your venture, but at this time I must have a budgetary gab with Will Stanton.\"\nRising with alacrity now that the meeting was over, Kyler Treadway strode to the door, and for the first time the president noted that the genius seated before him walked with a decided limp that marred the otherwise perfection of his physical frame.\n\"Your limp, Mr. Treadway. How came you by that?\" Lincoln said.\nKyler Treadway turned halfway. \"Shot in the calf by my owner, bone shattered attempting to escape, December 21st, 1853, Calhoun, Georgia.\"\n\"I see, Mr. Treadway.\" The president sighed. \"I will make arrangements with Mr. Johnson now. And I bid you a good day.\"\nThree months later Kyler Treadway stood on the darkening shore of the Chesapeake Bay, the stone walls of Ft. Monroe behind him as the sun set. Less than a mile out at sea he could perceive the dim outline of the Confederate ship Merrimac. Lying low in the gray water, every so often its guns flashed and cannon balls exploded into the Union fortress behind Treadway with a resounding crash.\nTreadway's right hand rested upon his creation. Sixteen feet long, by the fading light, his submarine looked like a giant silver cigar except for the propeller screw at the rear, the dark ballast tanks on which it rested, and the tiny conning tower just large enough to allow entry of a man.\nA jumble of thoughts ran through Treadway's head as the twelve Union sailors commissioned to assist him in launch scurried about the hastily constructed ramps leading into the ocean. Certain that this vessel held the key to Union success in the great struggle, Treadway felt a certain pride in what he was about to do, but that pride was mixed with fear.\nFor Kyler Treadway was a land-bound creature who had never learned to swim. His memory returned to his escape from the plantation and his initial crossing of the PeeDee River in the dead of night. With the dogs baying behind him, he had waded into the river uncertain as to its depths, but with absolute certitude as to what lay in store for him if he were recaptured. The whip! And so, frozen with terror on the inside, he had waded deeper and deeper into the primal darkness, the water finally reaching his nostrils. Then by the grace of God, the water rose no further as he successfully made it to the opposite shore.\nGuided by hawsers, his submarine, which he had privately christened Freedom's Sword slid down the ramps, settling uneasily into the calm waters of the bay. Kneeling where he stood, Treadway made an appeal to God for success in his venture, then he settled into the rowboat manned by a red-faced sailor boy, who uttered not a word, as he rowed towards the vessel.\nExiting the rowboat, Treadway clambered onto his creation, which felt tiny and insubstantial, rocking uneasily beneath his huge feet.\n\"That's a helluva coffin you've built, nigger, but God bless you!\" the boy sailor murmured as Treadway cast one last, longing look towards the shore.\n\"And you as well!\" Treadway said, lifting himself by main force so that his feet preceded him into the cramped belly of the submarine.\nThen reaching the floor of the vessel, he closed the hatch and squatted beside the torpedo as a faint cheer rose from the dozen sailors still ashore.\nOnce crouching before the control panel, sweat immediately rolled from Treadway's dark forehead as he at once began to experience the dread terror of claustrophobia. Fighting back his fear, he began to turn the mighty hand crank that would provide surface power until his invention came within 50 yards of the Merrimac, whereupon the tubes would fill with brine, and Freedom's Sword would plunge to 150 feet below the surface to deliver its surprise package.\nIt was no easy task turning the crank, and sweat gushed from Treadway's pores as he reviewed every detail of his life until that time. Even laboring under the brutal sun, bent over, in the cotton fields under the feral eye of the slavedriver took on a mellow glow as he remembered the sweet feeling of the rhythm of the work and the joy of being alive. He saw his mother's sweet face as she had cradled him as a child before she died. And then he saw his wife's strong, black body and gleaming teeth and wonderful smile, and his children. How must his children look by now?\nIt was for them above all and their children that this thing, despite terror, must be done. However, Treadway in no way relished the task of killing unsuspecting Confederate sailors aboard the Merrimac.\nAnd so, Freedom's Sword, almost as if in protest of its secret mission, rocked uneasily as it slowly traversed the waters of the bay in the direction that Treadway guesstimated lay the Merrimac. The skin of the leather-lined vessel was so thin he could feel the gentle buffeting of the waves as he cranked the balky surface propeller. His powerful arms began to grow tired, and so, lifting himself to the conning tower, he raised the hatch and glanced at his target.\nTaking a powerful breath of the salt air, he saw at once his calculations had not been inaccurate. Not over fifty yards off, a dark shadow on the moonlit bay, the Merrimac tossed at anchor, oblivious to nemesis lying in the darkness. Praying for the souls of the men who manned the rebel ship, Treadway closed the hatch. He was now about to undertake the most perilous segment of the voyage.\nActivating the hydraulic valve that would expel the air from the ballast tanks, with pounding heart, he heard the hissing as the tanks emptied. The two huge 75 cell batteries, fueled by water and sulfuric acid, began to hum, ready to propel the craft on its underwater mission. Now, too, Treadway could feel the pressure increasing inside the hull of his ship as the air grew sparse, and he had the horrible sense that he was about to be crushed by in-rushing water. His hands became slippery with sweat.\nDown, down, down sank the vessel. According to his experimental calculations on unmanned submersibles, descent to the proper depth should take no longer than 15 seconds. When his pocket watch so registered, he began the most delicate phase of the operation. Now the marvelous complexity of his invention unfurled itself as he pressed the activate button. The two 900 pound batteries began to tremble, sending raw energy to the two 50 horsepower motors that in turn drove the crankshaft, via a reduction gear which reduced propeller speed from 175 rpms from a motor speed of 900.\nWith a sigh of relief as the vessel surged forward at depth of over 50 yards, Treadway manually raised the collapsible conning tower. He could see the well-lighted Merrimac riding comfortably on the swells not over 35 yards ahead. Using the hand'steering mechanism to reach proper positioning for torpedo launch, he swung Freedom's Sword about. However, as the ship turned and he bent to load the torpedo, he heard a terrible rending of metal.\nTreadway's heart pounded wildly for he suspected the meaning of the sound. The main propeller of the vessel had somehow torn free of its welds. At the same time, the rhythmic churning of the electric motor ceased.\nHis wife's arms reached out to him. She was coming towards him, but he was being crushed. There was nothing left to breathe. His vessel was plunging out of control towards the bottom of the sea. It was only a matter of time.\n\"Father!\" his children cried out.\nHe saw Mr. Lincoln's grave face as he took his hand. \"The nation shall ever be indebted to you, Mr. Treadway.\"\nThere was no longer an ounce of air within the vessel. The walls were buckling. Sweat exploded from Treadway's forehead as a great appeal for life escaped his lips. And then with a frightening rending of metal, the tiny ship was crushed like wanton child's play, and the relentless sea poured into his lungs.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20051031124944\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/julysept2000\/treadway.htm","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"Set in the time of Abraham Lincoln, this story entertains the idea of a Union submarine designed by a brilliant young African American.

I\nremember for sure we was still in South Carolina.\nHenry went up and gave the signals we\u013ad been told, then waved us up.\nThey looked like such nice folks, standing there on their porch.\nIt wasn\u013at much of a house; two stories, five or six rooms on the first\nfloor. The second floor wasn\u013at\neven there - but I\u013am getting ahead of myself.\nIt\nwas late when we got there - we had to travel after dark, of course - and the\nkids didn\u013at have no energy left; they was asleep on the floor almost before we\nwalked in the door. Henry and I, we\nstayed up a bit talking to the folks whose house it was.\nThe Crenshaws, or the Cranleighs, somethin\u013a like that. We only had a few minutes.\nThe lights had to be out, you see, or some\u013an would \u0139spect.\nSo we set down to our beds next to the kids, and had four, maybe five\nhours before the sun woke us up again.\nWell,\nwhen we woke up the kids was gone, out of sight already.\nWe looked for \u0139em quick, but our hosts was down and makin\u013a breakfast,\nand we had to be polite, and was hungry besides.\nAnd what twelve-year-old boy won\u013at come out of hiding for fresh bacon\nanyhow?\nBy the time we was done eating we knew that: ours. Hannah hadn\u013at showed up neither, but she was never the breakfast type. But Jim ought to have been there punctual. That was when I started to worry. I went out to the parlor, and Mrs. Crawford came right out with me. I looked all through that room with her watchin\u013a me, and that\u013as when Henry came in. He started to look worried, too. Mr. Crispin was right behind Henry, and he said \u00f4I\u013all look upstairs\u00f6 in that way white folks do, all precise. He disappeared up them stairs.\nWorkin\u013a\ntogether, Henry and I searched the downstairs again, but like I said, it\nwasn\u013at that big. They wasn\u013at\nthere. We started to panic. \u00f4They\ngo outside?\u00f6 Henry asked me.\n\u00f4No\nway, Henry Freeman!\u00f6 We had\nalready taken our new names by then; no more master names for this family.\n\u00f4They know better\u013an to go out at daytime! They be upstairs.\u00f6 I\nturned and walked to the stairs, and I swear Mrs. Cross turned two shades paler.\nShe ran up and got in my way.\n\u00f4You\ncan\u013at go up there,\u00f6 she said. \u00f4Let\nmy husband handle it. I\u013am sure\nhe\u013all only be a minute longer.\u00f6 Them\nwhite folks, always addin\u013a extra words when they ain\u013at necessary.\nI used to wonder if I\u013ad talk like that, when I was free.\nGuess not. Too set in my\nways, maybe.\nAnyway,\nit wasn\u013at a minute later when Mr. Cramer came down with the kids.\nHe was whispering something in Hannah\u013as ear, and she had that sweet\nseven-year-old smile that\u013as even better on a free girl.\nJim was standin\u013a soldier-straight and blank-faced.\nI asked him what he\u013ad been up to.\n\u00f4Just playin\u013a, Ma,\u00f6 was the only answer I got.\nBut I could see him tryin\u013a not to grin.\nMrs. Cornwall was talkin\u013a at me, so I had to wait on Jim.\n\u00f4It\u013as\ntime now, Marie,\u00f6 she said to me.\n\u00f4Time\nfor what?\u00f6\n\u00f4Time\nto leave.\u00f6\n\u00f4It\u013as\nstill light out.\u00f6 I thought that\nwas obvious.\n\u00f4Not\nthat way.\u00f6 She pointed up the stairs.\n\u00f4You\njust said we can\u013at go there!\u00f6\n\u00f4We\nhad to find Jim and Hannah first. You\nhave to all go together.\u00f6\nOf\ncourse we did. But what else was there to do?\nShe was determined, and I wanted to know what it was made it so hard for\nJim to keep a straight face. So I\nheaded up the stairs. Henry looked\ndisturbed, and hesitated.\n\u00f4We\njust want what\u013as best for you,\u00f6 said Mr. Clayton.\n\u00f4The transference will be made through \u013e\u00f4\nHe realized he wasn\u013at making no sense to us, and just said \u00f4you\u013all\nbe safe. Freedom lies ahead.\u00f6\nHenry\nshook his head, but he followed me up. That\nsmile finally broke Jim\u013as face, but he still wasn\u013at talkin\u013a.\nAnd then Mr. Calloway sent us through the door at the top of the stairs.\nI\nexpected a room, maybe a hallway. What\nI got was white light, a light so bright I couldn\u013at see nothin\u013a. And\nmotion. I was on a train once, in\nmy old life, but that wasn\u013at nothin\u013a like this.\nThis was fast. I\ndunno how long we was up there. Maybe\nan hour, maybe five minutes \u013e I lost track of the time, but it felt like\nwe\u013ad gone an awful long way. But\nwhen we came down the stairs again, it was the same as before.\n\u0139Cept for one thing: the Chilsons was gone.\nThere wasn\u013at nobody in the house.\nWe\ndidn\u013at know what to do, but Jim pulled my hand.\n\u00f4Come on, Momma, come look! He\nran to the window and started to pull back the drape.\nI\ngrabbed his hand. \u00f4It\u013as light\nout, Jim! You know we can\u013at be\nseen here!\u00f6\n\u00f4Oh\nyes we can, Momma! We can be seen here!\u00f6\nHe pulled his hand away from me and ripped open the drape. Somehow we was in a city. The buildings was tall and brick, and in the distance I could see a big park, and a harbor. This wasn\u013at South Carolina; too many people, buildings too close together.\nJim was out the door and on the street already. The white folks all looked at him, but they wasn\u013at upset, they didn\u013at cause no alarm. Was like a little black boy in the street happened every day. I went out and grabbed him, but when I looked up the street it was just like a picture I saw once. That's when I knew. We was out, home free; they wouldn\u013at be coming after us no more - this was Boston!","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050903212707\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/janmar2001\/underground.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The Internet's Premier Magazine of Historical Science Fiction","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/Jy9rak1E8B46UiT8Ro4ZbI1AwXw.json","volume":2.0,"issues":1.0,"has_text":true}

Yes;\na half-tumbled barn in the south of England.\nHe had entered the country a few weeks earlier, swimming the Channel with\ntireless strokes.\nA\nsecond explosion came like rolling thunder, then a third, each closer than the\none before.\nHe\nrose from his moldy bedding, careful not to bump the sagging rafters.\nHe patted his hip, where hung the pouch that contained his few\npossessions. He knew the power of\nhumanity\u2019s cannons and bombs, but their reverberations seemed alien to this\ngreen and pleasant land.\nHe\nstepped to the entrance, a parallelogram of twisted gray timbers, and looked to\nthe east, where a sizable town lay.\nBy\nhis mortal Creator, the whole horizon rose in a sheet of flame!\nSilhouettes of houses, stores, and steeples wavered against the light of\nthe conflagration. Were men so mad\nas to destroy their own homes, their own cities?\nA\nsizzling, as of water on a hot griddle, drifted to him through a stand of\npoplars. The misshapen sleeper\nstepped into the pre-dawn mist, wariness giving way to curiosity.\nHe\nspotted a faint bar of illumination to the north, a greenish Milky Way\nstretching east to west across the sky. It\nshifted slowly toward him, and the ogrish Creation marked it a beam of radiance\nlike a lighthouse's.\nShaash\n-- shaash came a sound, like that a squall line makes against a forest.\nOrange flames flared from the upper branches of one poplar, then another.\nThe\nradiant beam angled lower. The\nsizzle became a wasp-drone, and trees split with the thunder of calving\nglaciers, blasts born of fire rather than ice.\nThe\nwatcher threw himself to the ground, digging his fingers into the sward as the\nlighthouse beam rippled across the old barn.\nSplinters and nails, barrel hoops and planks, all hot and black and\nsmoking, rained down on the Creation's broad back.\nThe droning reached a crescendo and ceased, leaving the crackle of a\ndozen fires as the only noise in the twilight.\nThe\nwanderer loped heavily towards the town of Weybridge.\nFear gnawed him like carrion rats. He\nheard the yells of men and women and the shrill neighing of horses.\nHe thought of the wars on the Continent, which he had watched from ditch\nand forest.\nHe\napproached a wide avenue through a copse of shaggy willows.\nHorses, carts, wagons, and people on foot crowded past, some screaming,\nsome crying, some hollow-eyed and silent.\nSmoke\nstung his eyes. He heard the\ndroning again, and a drum roll of distant explosions.\nThe\nCreation ventured to the edge of the trees, perfectly visible yet unseen.\nA trap drawn by a roan mare ran down a man with a carpetbag.\nA cyclist swerved onto the bank verging the road and toppled.\nThe\nwatcher accepted this gift from Providence.\nIn three strides he reached the cyclist.\nHe caught the man by the scruff of the neck and hauled him up like a\nkitten.\nThe\nman wore knickers, a drab brown jacket, a checkered cap, and green-tinted\ngoggles. His eyes grew wide within\nthe last, as the Creation expected, and he waited out the equally expected\nscream.\n\"Quiet,\nlittle man,\" he ordered gruffly. \"I\nwill not harm you. I desire only to\nknow --\"\n\"Help! Help!\" yelled the cyclist.\nThe\nmortal swung his fists ineffectually, like an angry baby, and he ran frantically\nin place, though his heels dangled two feet from the earth.\nSuch\nantics lost their novelty decades ago. The\nCreation caught the cyclist's throat in his other hand.\nHis fingers and thumb nearly met around the man's neck in a collar of\ngray-blue flesh. The mortal grabbed\nhis wrist and ceased his useless struggles.\n\"Speak,\nman, before my minuscule store of patience ebbs,\" growled the Creation.\n\"What enemy do you flee? What\nweapon is this that can burn forests and buildings from afar?\"\nThe\ncyclist lifted a hand from his captor's wrist.\nHe stared at the corded sutures encircling the log-thick arm.\n\"I\n-- Bloody \u2018Ell--\"\nHis\neyes flicked up at the Creation's face -- then away.\n\"The\nMartians -- By God! Haven't you\nheard? The Martians are coming!\"\nThe\nCreation grinned crookedly. He let\nhis left hand fall from the man's throat but still held him suspended with his\nright.\n\"I\ndo not receive the Times on my doorstep, little man,\" he said.\n\"Perhaps you would be so kind as to explain -- 'Martians'?\"\nThe\nman's jacket drew up beneath his armpits. He\nhad to force in his breath like one crucified.\n\"Don't\nknow much,\" he babbled. \"Falling\nstar hit near Woking -- only it were no falling star.\nA hollow casing -- a shell -- with some sort of ungodly creatures in\nit!\"\nHe\npointed away awkwardly.\n\"'Papers\nsay they came from Mars -- the planet Mars, shot here in shells -- Jules\nVerne in reverse! They brought a\nfire-gun with them -- Heat-Ray, they calls it!\"\nAs\nthough naming the weapon conjured it, a hissing noise filled the air.\nThe cyclist yelled and fought again, and the Creation dropped him\nheedlessly.\nThe\nhiss rose to an angry buzz. From\nthe road came screams, drowned in chestnut-cracklings and green-wood pops.\nThe\ncyclist scuttled crablike away. The\nCreation turned, looked through the trees, and watched a line of trunks burst\ninto flame like sulphur matches. He\nhad time only to cover his eyes with his forearm before molten-lead pain\nengulfed him.\nHe\ncame to slowly this time. A\nsizzling hot blanket smothered him. He\nsmelled burnt flesh, sweet like pork.\nHe\nopened his eyes to see streamers of smoke.\nHe lifted an arm sluggishly, and something long and black swung over his\nface.\nThe\npain maddened him. He sat up,\nfeeling twinges with every movement. He\nheard a crunch-crunch as bits of his chest and stomach flaked away.\nNo\nforest surrounded him, only black stumps smoking and flickering with flame.\nHe thought of a child's cake with candles alight.\nThe road, screened by willows moments ago, was a brown strip in a field\nof ash.\nFire-gun,\nthe cyclist said. Heat-Ray.\nHe\nlooked over his arms, hurt and confused. The\nupper surface of his left arm was a cracked expanse of charcoal.\nThe palm of his right hand and the underside of his right arm were\nsimilarly charred. He recalled\ncovering his eyes. That action\ndoubtlessly saved his sight.\nHe\nrose, flakes of skin cracking off. A\nclear liquid spread over his charred torso.\nHe staggered toward the road, enveloped in agony as in a squeezing fist.\nThe smells of smoke, from wood, leather, cloth, rubber, horseflesh, and\npeople, clogged the air.\nThe\nCreation stumbled down the bank. Carriages\nlay in black piles of wire and soot. Horses\nlay in frayed heaps. The people\nwere discarded scarecrows, filled with embers rather than straw.\nThough\nhe felt no love for mortals, the Creation felt a deep pit of sickness in his\nsoul. He inhaled painfully and climbed the opposite bank.\nHe\nlay on the muddy shore of a river beneath a rickety bridge.\nThe agony of the burns passed. Where\na human being would have been permanently crippled, he had merely been\ninconvenienced.\n\"So\ndid you build me, Victor, to be superior to all men.\"\nHe\nsnorted at the irony. He waited,\nthinking.\nMartians.\nThe\nlittle mortals who ran to and fro across the globe would never have believed it,\nbut the Creation was a being of high intelligence.\nBooks were his sole companions. He\nknew of the other worlds in space; one, christened Neptune, had been discovered\nonly half a century ago. He\nrecalled, with a fond smile, Voltaire's tale Micromegas, about the giants\nfrom Saturn and the star Sirius visiting the earth.\nThat\nsuch things could be real, though. . .\nThwud.\nThe\nCreation drew his legs close and sat up, as attentive as a stalking tiger.\nThwud.\nHe\nthought of footfalls -- if there existed a creature large enough to make the\nvery earth resound with its steps.\nThwud.\nHe\nedged over to the side of the bridge and peered up at a line of white birch.\nAn\nobject slid smoothly eastward above the tree tops, a vast silver dome atop a\nthick column. The object crossed a horse-path that led down to the river,\nand the Creation glimpsed legs like articulated flagpoles and steel cables that\ncoiled like serpents. The legs\nsupported an oval body, over which the dome sat, much like a head.\nIndeed, the dome swung from side to side, exactly like a person taking in\nthe scenery, and when it looked toward the bridge it revealed a dark window or\nvisor, giving the impression of eyes.\n\"Machines?\"\nwhispered the watcher. \"It\nwalks and stares about like a man. They\nare machines that nearly live -- or perhaps they are creatures that are nearly\nmachines! I wonder what you would\nmake of them, Victor?\"\nThe\nMartian passed out of view as swiftly as a horse.\nThe Creation trotted under the bridge and paused in the shadows on the\nother side. The ground-shaking\nsteps ceased. He gazed up fearfully\nat the immense Unknown.\nThe\nMartian stood on the bank of the river, several hundred yards downstream.\nIt possessed only three actual legs, like a camera's tripod.\nThe other limbs were silver snakes of arms.\nThe \"head\" tilted so that the dark visor scanned the earth.\nTwo arms stretched down and forward, quivering along the mud like the\nfeelers of an ant.\nAn\noutcry and a crunch of wood, and the tentacles rose again.\nOne held a splintered bouquet of lemon-yellow boards, from which oars and\nseat-cushions fell. A skiff or\nrowboat, the Creation guessed. The\nsecond steel arm held a man.\nThe\nfigure screamed piteously, kicking the air and pounding the silver coils with\nhis fists. Evidently he had hidden beneath the overturned skiff only to\nbe discovered by the probing tentacles.\nThe\nTripod raised its victim sixty feet from the earth and studied him as a boy\nmight regard a tin soldier. Finally,\nthe Gargantuan machine swung its arm in a wide arc and released the man in\nmid-air. Its visor-eyes followed the wretch's flight as he shrieked\nover the bank and hit a tree with enough force to snap the trunk.\nThe\nCreation swore. The Martian's\nattitude struck him as that of a scientist who tortured and shocked animals to\nobserve their reactions. Their\nastounding walking machines, and the mere fact that they had flown here from\ntheir own world, marked them as scientists, perhaps a whole race of them.\nHe\nhad fallen in with several scientists during his century of life, from his own\ncreator onwards. He did not care\nfor their ilk. He envisioned all\nthe world as a pen of experimental animals for the study of colossal\nresearchers.\nPtoom.\n. . Ptoom. . . Ptoom. . .\nWoolly\nblack puffs bloomed around the Tripod's head.\nThe Creation scanned the far shore of the river.\nWhite columns billowed up from a stand of aspen.\nA brigade of artillerists had loosed a volley, perhaps stirred by the\nMartian's murderous act.\nThe\ndome-head of the Tripod looked as well. Something\nlike an elephant's trunk rose from beneath the dark visor and held up a glinting\nlens. The droning came again, and\nthe green half-light shone over the forest.\nSap-laden\nbranches burst like fireworks. Leaves\nswirled away like dust. Orange-black\nflowers of flame and smoke marked cannon shells exploding in their casings.\nThe\nCreation waited under the bridge until the silvery Titan strode away downstream.\nHe crept out at last and studied the opposite bank.\nThe\nwhole valley smoldered like coal. A\npyramidal lump here and there might have been a cannon.\nThe\nCreation shook his head. He would\nhave to side with humanity in the face of these invaders.\nHe\nclimbed the bank slowly, scanning the horizon for the Tripod or other colossi\nlike it. He stubbed his toe on a rusty anchor and fell headlong.\nHe\nrose and glanced back at the little wooden bridge, old and brittle and\nneglected. He smiled.\nHe\ncrouched in the nettles and watched a second Tripod amble down the road.\nAmble was an apt term, for the silver-white giant possessed the\nair of a country squire on an afternoon hike, the oval body and the headlike\ndome bobbing slightly with each step.\nThe\nTripod kept to the wide avenue. The\nthree-legged being did not walk in the clumsy manner of a man on crutches;\ninstead the war machine rolled along, tilted at a dangerous angle.\nWhile it moved, the legs never touched the ground simultaneously.\nInstead, a leg swung up behind, out to the left, and down.\nThe next leg followed this arc before the castor-foot of the first\ntouched earth again. As the weight\nof the Tripod swung forward onto the first leg, the third left the avenue\nbehind.\nThe\nCreation smiled through his ragged lips. Three\nlegs, hah! Only for a brief second,\nafter the first leg hit and before the third lifted, was the monster even braced\nby two. At any given moment, a\nsingle silver-white pole supported the Tripod.\nThe\nearth shook intermittently as the Tripod strode nearer.\nThe watcher glanced one last time at the worn wooden bridge, then he\ndashed out of hiding.\nThwud. Twenty feet away a great castor-foot clumped down on the\nroad, splitting the clay surface and rattling pebbles. Overhead, segmented tentacles and metallic spider legs spun\nlike the arms of a windmill.\nSe\u0144or\nQuixote, I do you one better, thought the Creation.\nHe\nreached up, biceps like bull's haunches, forearms thick as a normal man's\nthighs. He braced himself as the\nfathom-wide disk of the Tripod's foot swung down.\nHe\npushed against the crushing metal piston. Muscles\nbulged and bulked and tore blue-gray skin.\nCentury-old sutures ripped and popped.\nBone and steel groaned, ligaments stretched.\nHe\nthought of mortals, with their frightened faces, blasting rifles, crackling\ntorches. He thought of the man who brought him into this world only to\nabandon him, loathe him, flee him with the witless squeals of a toddler.\nHe hated. Hate gave him\nstrength.\nHe\nbellowed and shoved with power that astonished even himself, power that Hercules\nand Atlas would have envied.\nAs\na human stride is undone by stepping on an unexpected croquet ball, so now was\nthe walking machine's smooth flow interrupted.\nThe leg that came down upon the Creation, which should have been the\nTripod\u2019s momentary support, flew out to its right.\nThe second, already swinging forward, shot down into the bough of a tree\nwith a thunderous crack. The\nthird, which left the road and should have arced forward, jerked away at right\nangles to the lane.\nThe\nCreation's arms and legs throbbed with pain.\nHe could see his own muscles, pink within foot-long gashes in his skin.\nHis joints ached as if filled with ground glass.\nHe\nlaughed. The Tripod stumbled with the comical steps of a bumpkin whose\ntrousers have fallen about his ankles. The\nglittering octopus-arms whipped out at the tops of trees to anchor its progress.\nThrack -- Snapt -- Kraatch, and the thin birch limbs\ngave way.\nThe\nhead-compartment jerked away from the tilt, and a steely leg stabbed down.\nThis next step would have halted the Tripod -- if it had not set its\ndisk-foot in the middle of the rickety bridge.\nThe\nbridge slued aside under the Tripod's weight.\nThe glittering Juggernaut froze at an impossible angle for a moment;\nthen, with the squeal of a braking train, it fell.\nThe\nTripod hit the water, sending white geysers everywhere. An explosion beneath the\nsurface resulted in a loud burble, and the Creation glimpsed gold and\nscarlet sparks within the head-dome. A\nstrange green smoke billowed out of the machine.\nThe\nCreation picked his way down the bank and stood knee-deep in cattails.\nHe watched the Tripod die -- and he could only think of it in terms of an\nanimal expiring. A silver leg\ntwitched like a grasshopper's. Tentacles\ncurled and thrashed like snakes cut with a hoe.\nBubbles broke near the cowl\/head, giving the machine the impression of\ndrowning. It even let out a\ndeath-howl, a low uuuhllll-uuuhlll that vibrated through the mud rather\nthan the air.\nThe\nwatcher frowned. A huge, oily,\ngray-brown something slipped out of the cowl and vanished into the stream.\nHe thought of a walrus, massive, flabby, and slick; but did he not see\nwaving whips of arms, tentacles like those of the machine itself?\nHe\nwaded into the river, ignoring the sucking mud and islands of water lilies.\nThere, in the shadow of the Tripod's head, something slapped the water to\nfroth.\nThe\nCreation slogged nearer until the river topped his belt.\nThe frenzied motion ceased, as if the thing from the Tripod had suddenly\nnoted him.\nHe\ngasped. A huge face glared out of\nthe water with reptilian malevolence. He\nmade out great black saucer-eyes, shiny like obsidian, and a beak of a mouth.\nThe face took up the whole front of an octopus-like body.\nThe\nthing drew into itself, tortoise-fashion, and now it looked like nothing more\nthan a large stone in the shadow of the fallen Juggernaut.\nThe\nwatcher laughed again.\n\"By\nmy accursed Creator!\" he cried. \"You,\nwise and mighty Martian, are even uglier than I!\"\nHe\nsloshed closer. The Martian\nrealized its ruse had not worked; whip-limbs flailed as it tried to paddle\nitself under the neck of the Tripod.\nThe\nCreation wrapped a muscular arm around each side of the Martian's body, which\ncould just as easily be called its head. He\nlifted the space-borne being from the murky water.\nThe tentacles whirred like the legs of a shrimp.\nOne lash, then another, snapped up at his cheeks and neck.\nHe\nbounced the Martian once, like a sack of produce about to slip from his grasp,\nthen he waded ashore.\n\"Uglier\nthan I!\" he repeated.\nThe\nMartian lay in a corner of the deserted stables, glowering with its saucer eyes.\nIt had no nostrils, and only one ear, a membrane on the back of its body.\nThe\nCreation entered and barred the door with a railroad tie.\nHis new friend, struggling against the earth's greater gravity, would not\nbe leaving in that direction.\nHatred\nbillowed through the air at him. Literally:\nThe invaders communicated by some form of mental transference.\nThat was fortunate for this particular Martian; otherwise, it could not\nhave told him what to look for back at the fallen Tripod.\nA\nquery, like a huge interrogation mark, filled the dusty interior of the stables.\n\"Yes,\nI found it,\" answered the Creation.\nOut\nof his pouch he produced an instrument like a tiny bagpipe made of steel.\n\"You must use this to live?\"\nThe\noctopoid creature curled its tentacles and closed its beak, concentrating.\nMore impressions clouded up. The\nMartian's thoughts were many and swift -- and still tinged with rage at its\ncapture by a lowly Terrestrial. Touching\nits mind was like watching a lightning storm.\nStill,\nthe Creation caught flashes of meaning. An\nidea of food, coupled with skin-rippling disgust.\nThey hated \"eating\", as humans used the term.\nThat was an occupation of dirty, stupid animals.\nWhat they needed was --\n\"Blood,\"\nsaid the Creation. \"Pure and\nliquid life. So, you are a new\nspecies of vampire, come from the stars rather than the grave.\"\nHe\nheld up the many-piped device.\n\"And\nthis instrument purifies it for you. Very\nwell.\"\nHe\ntore the sleeve of his coat, a patchwork assembly of scraps like himself.\n\"Let\nus see how you fare on the liquid in my veins.\"\nThe\nCreation prowled through the ruins of a deserted town by the light of a quarter\nmoon. Whole blocks had been reduced\nto ash. The remaining buildings\nstood dark and silent.\nHe\nfound a weed-choked garden. He\njerked up onions and carrots and devoured them, greens and clinging dirt and\nall.\nDogs\nbarked. He sprang over a stone fence and followed the noise.\nNot even he could supply all the Martian's needs, and he himself had not\ntasted meat for a month.\nThe\nCreation crossed the village square, ignoring the scattered bones and overturned\ncarriages. At a row of brownstones\nhe halted in astonishment.\nA\nsilver Tripod lay on its side in the cobbled lane, its head resting on rubble as\nif on a pillow. Emaciated dogs\nscampered back and forth before the shiny corpse.\nTwo whippet-thin beasts played tug-o'-war with a dark strip of something.\nIntrigued, the Creation strode toward them.\nThe\ndogs forgot their explorations and presented a front of bared fangs and\nbristling fur.\n\"Begone!\"\nbellowed the Creation.\nHis\nvoice echoed through the empty streets like a thunderclap.\nThe starving canines loped away, tails between their legs.\nThe\nCreation searched the rubble and found a torn, snakelike appendage.\nHe spotted a circular hatchway on the bottom of the Tripod's head.\nTentacles hung like wisteria from it.\nA smell of decay welled out also.\n[?],\ncame the Martian's inquiry.\nThe\nCreation scanned the newspaper columns.\n\"Bacteria,\"\nhe explained. \"Animalcules. Creatures so tiny they cannot be seen. They enter the body by means of a cut, or by simple\ninhalation, and therein they multiply and feed and release toxins.\nWe of earth suffer from them, and sometimes die of their infestations,\nbut we are inured to their presence.\"\nHe\nfolded the Daily Telegraph and rose.\n\"This\npublication suggests that your fellow Martians knew not of their\nexistence.\"\n[.\n. .], thought the Martian, a feeling of depression and agreement.\nThe\nCreation dug armfuls of straw from the farm wagon he had appropriated.\n[?],\nasked the Martian.\nThe\nCreation guffawed as he spread blankets over the wagon's bed.\n\"Can\nyou not see, my friend?\" he asked back.\n\"You have feasted upon my blood, which is not that of mortal men.\nMy creator added unknown potions to it to improve its vintage.\nIt has flowed through my veins for a century, and neither Time, nor\ninjury, nor poison, nor disease has lain me low.\nYou owe your existence to Victor Frankenstein as much as I.\"\nHe\ncaught up the Martian in his scarred and sutured arms.\nThe creature did not struggle, but clouds of humiliation and anger still\npoured from its huge brain. He\nlowered the invader onto the wagon bed, then he set his pack and the Martian's\nblood-purifier in with it. The\npsychical storm lashed higher as he buried the extraterrestrial beneath the hay.\n\"It\nwould not do for the little men to see you, Martian,\" the Monster of\nFrankenstein remarked.\nThe\ntelepathic cloud dissipated.\nThe\nCreation seized the wooden tongue in his massive hand and trundled the wagon\nbehind him through the darkness as easily as a child draws a balloon.\nHis white, even teeth shone through his gash of a mouth.\n\"I\nam a humble creature, Martian. All\nI ever desired in my long and wretched existence was a friend.\"\nHe\nsighed.\n\"It\nwill be good to have a friend.\"\nThe\nMartian fumed helplessly.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050421124105\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/aprjun2001\/humblest.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The Internet's Premier Magazine of Historical Science Fiction","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/0KwzuhUWUlFwhiWigR2MDoCNM48.json","volume":2.0,"issues":2.0,"has_text":true}

She had a face. Rene couldn't wait to tell them about\nher.\nShe walked firmly up the path. And her face - eyes, nose,\nmouth, just like the paintings his parents had showed him!\nRene never saw faces - well, not except for them, and their\nfaces didn't look like what faces were supposed to. And his\nown face in the mirror, of course, but that wasn't real.\nBut there she was. Beautiful, Rene thought, though he was\nseven years old and hers was the first human face he had ever\nseen. He stood and stared, fascinated, as she reached the\nend of the walk and stood in front of him. He knew he should\nsay something, but he could only stand, head tilted slightly\nto the left, and stare at her profile.\nFinally, she turned and spoke to him. \"Do you not speak?\"\n\"I-I'm sorry,\" he stammered. \"It's just that\nyou're so beautiful.\"\n\"What do you know of beauty, boy? You are so young --\nfor you, beauty must simply be a reflection of the mother.\"\nRene frowned. She had a face, but she talked just like the\nrest of them. More so. And she was not so old -- perhaps she\nhad reached her twelfth year. Rene noticed she had not yet\nbegun to grow breasts. But he was too struck to be too bothered\nby her condescension. Instead, he said, \"But you are\nbeautiful. I had never truly seen a face before seeing yours\nnow.\"\nShe giggled. \"Flatterer.\" She walked past him and\ninto the house - into his house. What was she doing there?\nRene sighed with relief as she went inside. He had revealed\nhis secret, and she had passed it off as flattery. He would\nhave to get better control of himself before he saw her again,\neven if she was a pompous twit.\n###\n\"I\nmet a girl with a face today,\" he told them. \"She's\ngoing to live in my house.\"\nThey turned their own faces to look at each other, like fresh\npeaches with lots of eyes, or perhaps like violins with beady\nstring-ends. Then they looked back at him. \"Why is this?\"\n\"I don't know,\" said Rene. \"I think she's our\nnanny. I don't see why we need a nanny. Mother manages just\nfine.\"\n\"Nanny,\" said the aliens to each other. \"Nanny.\nNanny.\"\nRene waited until they were done with the word. \"Do you\nthink it means anything that she has a face?\"\n\"Your face?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Our faces?\"\n\"No, her own face. Different. Like in a painting.\"\nThey were still as only they knew how to be. \"It means\nnothing.\"\n\"How\ndo you know?\"\n\"Why did you ask us, if we did not know?\"\n\"I wanted your opinion.\"\nThey buzzed.\n\"Your advice.\"\nThey buzzed some more.\n\"Well, what do I do with a girl who has a face?\"\n\"What do you do with a nanny?\"\nRene frowned. \"I think a nanny does more with me.\"\n\"Well, then. Let her. And we will see.\"\n\"You want me to bring her to meet you?\"\n\"No, no,\" they all said. \"No. No girls. Not\nwith faces, not without faces. Nobody. Just you.\"\n\"All right,\" said Rene, a little disappointed. \"If\nshe's a real nanny, she'll want to take care of me. Keep an\neye on me. All of that. It'll be harder to come see you.\"\n\"You will do it,\" said one of the aliens.\n\"You will manage,\" another agreed.\n\"But how?\"\nThey were silent. \"Tell us about the seashore,\"\nsaid one.\n\"About brushes.\"\n\"About influenza.\"\n\"Tell us what it is like.\"\nRene sighed. \"People go to the seashore on holiday,\"\nhe began.\n###\nThe girl was not going to let him leave. Her name, Rene discovered,\nwas Audrine, and she was part nanny, part ladies' maid, part\nmaid of all work. He never called her Audrine, though. Names\nwere for people who didn't have faces, so that he could keep\ntrack of them. She was just the girl.\nShe often returned the favor by calling him \"boy,\"\nbut Rene knew she could see other people's faces. She had\nwiped dirt smudges from his brothers' chins -- or so she had\nsaid. Rene could see neither chins nor smudges, and had to\ntake her word for it.\n\"Boy,\" she said, \"your mother says you are\nnot to wander off.\"\n\"I won't wander.\"\n\"That is not an answer,\" she said.\n\"It is.\"\n\"I am in charge, and I say it is not.\"\nRene sighed. \"All right. What if I just amuse myself\nin the back parlor, then?\"\n\"As you wish.\"\nHe gathered up the things he wanted and settled next to the\nsofa. Frustration, yes. He could use the apple for Frustration,\nbut only if it was near the blue cloth, and perhaps the comb.\nHe laid them out on the sofa, apple on the cloth, comb leaning.\nHe stepped back. Almost. Almost Frustration. He hesitated\na minute before choosing the quill pen. Yes, that finished\nit.\nThen he sat down on the floor next to the sofa leg. He had\na postcard, a penknife, some matches, a little porcelain man,\nand a broken feather. There was something, but it was at the\ntip of his brain. Pain? No, no, nothing so obvious. Completion?\nAh, he had it. Loneliness. He scored the neck of the porcelain\nman with the penknife and then snapped the head off, neatly.\nHe was trying to get the feather to balance on the headless\nbody when Audrine found him.\n\"Rene! You little beast, you've broken it!\" she\nsaid. \"Oh, what a naughty boy you are. You won't get\nanother of them just because you broke that one, let me tell\nyou.\"\nHe looked up at her in amazement. \"I don't want another.\"\nWhat was her face doing? It was all twisted up, with wrinkles\non the forehead.\nShe noticed the layout on the sofa. \"What's this?\"\n\"Frustration?\"\n\"You\nwanted to frustrate me? Well, you've done a good job of that.\"\n\"No,\" he protested. \"It's not frustrating.\nIt's Frustration.\"\n\"You, young master, are frustration,\" said the girl\ntartly. \"I won't be surprised if your father spanks you\nfor breaking your toys. Clean it up, and don't make messes\nin the parlor any longer.\"\nRene stared after her. He had thought that people with faces\nmight be easier to understand, but there was no difference.\nHe scooped the items carefully together and held the scarf\naround them, then made for the riverside bench where the aliens\nliked to find him.\nThey came soon after he got there. He laid the apple out for\nthem, the cloth and the comb, and last the quill. \"What\nis it?\"\n\"Frustration,\" said the aliens, buzzing.\n\"Frustration.\"\n\"Frustration, yes.\"\n\"I thought so,\" he said with satisfaction. \"What\nof this one?\" He started to show them Loneliness.\nOne of the aliens laid a hand on his wrist. \"No. Do not\nfinish it. We cannot bear it, once it is complete.\"\n\"But it is Loneliness,\" he pressed.\n\"Loneliness, yes,\" said one.\n\"Zzzzolitude,\" said another.\n\"So why couldn't she see them?\"\n\"The girl again?\"\n\"The girl, yes. She has a face. She has eyes, I've seen\nthem. Why can she not see?\"\n\"She is human.\"\n\"Human.\"\n\"Human.\"\n\"But I am human.\"\n\"We know.\"\n\"We have heard.\"\n\"We see it in your arrangements. In your face.\"\n\"But the girl has a face!\" Rene was near tears with\nthe frustration of it all.\n\"Show her.\"\n\"You must show her.\"\n\"Show her.\"\n\"Show her.\"\n###\n\"He\nwanders off,\" said Audrine.\n\"He always has,\" said Rene's mother vaguely.\nRene waited around the corner, fiddling with a comb.\n\"I don't know what to do with him,\" said Audrine.\n\"When he doesn't wander off, he breaks things and leaves\nthem all over the house, on the furniture, in the doorways.\nHe won't stop breaking things.\"\nRene\nthreaded a piece of twine into the comb, back and forth. Information,\nhe thought. He would show it to Audrine. Even though she didn't\nseem to be listening.\n\"Your job entails stopping him, girl,\" said Rene's\nmother. \"Do you forget why we hired you?\"\n\"No, ma'am,\" said Audrine. Rene could tell she was\nangry. \"But Rene is --\"\n\"Rene is seven. He must learn better. He has always been\nan odd little boy. You must teach him.\"\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\nRene could hear that Audrine was not happy, and when she came\naround the corner, her face had made the bad lines again.\nHe longed to smooth it out and make it clean like a piece\nof soap, but he didn't want to make the features go away.\nHe just wanted them to be different. He held out the comb\nanyway. \"Information,\" he said.\n\"Stop it!\" She slapped his hand. He almost dropped\nthe comb in surprise. \"You are to become a credit to\nyour family, do you hear? And a credit to me.\"\nHe cocked his head at her. \"I can make Credit,\"\nhe said. \"If you let me have the pieces of my jumping\njack back, and perhaps a potato, I will show you that --\"\n\"You broke it!\" she snapped. \"You will not\nhave it back, and you will not have another, not until you\nlearn to stop all of this nonsense. A potato! What do you\nwant with a potato?\"\n\"Why do you never listen to what I show you?\"\n\"Because it's like listening to a rubbish heap!\"\nRene thought about trying to explain a rubbish heap to the\naliens.\n\"But rubbish heaps don't talk.\"\n\"Children!\" she snorted. \"You must learn not\nto be so literal.\"\n\"I must?\"\n\"Yes. And you must speak when you are spoken to.\"\n\"You are speaking to me.\"\n\"You are being pert again! You must not be pert.\"\n\"Audrine, why are you here?\"\nRene meant, why are you here with me, having a face, when\nthe others do not? But Audrine sighed. \"I don't think\nthey have the money for another, better servant, Rene. And\nso you have me. And I am quite good enough.\"\n\"Of course,\" he said in confusion. Maybe if he made\nSufficiency for her, she would see that.\n###\nShe\nwould not let him out to play near the rubbish heap, so he\nhad to sneak around from the garden into it. The aliens were\nwaiting.\n\"This is a rubbish heap.\"\nThey buzzed. They repeated nothing.\n\"Rubbish heap!\" he said, a little louder. \"It's\nwhere they put things when they don't understand them. Because\nthe things don't let them talk any more.\"\n\"Rubbish heap.\"\n\"Rubbish heap?\"\n\"Apple core,\" said one of the aliens.\n\"Yes, there's an apple core. They're done with the rest\nof the apple.\"\n\"Schooling?\"\nRene sighed. An apple core was part of Schooling. \"No,\njust apple core.\"\n\"Core,\" they buzzed.\n\"No, no. It's just a rubbish heap. Do you understand?\nThey're not saying anything. They're not even trying to say\nanything. It's just -- garbage.\"\n\"Apple core. Violin string. Sardine tin.\"\n\"Matchbook. With no matches.\"\nRene sat down on the ground and tried to make Rubbish Heap\nout of the rubbish heap, but it kept going wrong somehow.\nAudrine found him there, deserted long ago by the aliens.\nHer frustration echoed up and down the street. Rene's younger\nbrothers milled against each other nervously. Rene knew their\nfaces would be twisted up, if they had had faces.\n\"What have I told you? Have you listened to a word? Your\nbrothers are babies, and they know not to play in rubbish.\"\n\"I was trying to make Rubbish Heap.\"\n\"We already have one! What do we need with another?\"\n\"So they can know it.\"\nAudrine made an inarticulate noise. She grabbed him by the\near and hauled him into the house, up to his room. \"And\nthere you stay until I come for you again,\" she said.\n\"Enough is enough!\"\nRene stared at the walls of his room. He wanted to make Sufficiency,\nbut the matches were missing, and the mirror was, too. But\nif he couldn't make Sufficiency, Audrine would never understand,\nand then it wouldn't matter that she had a face at all. Sufficiency\nwasn't like String Beans. There was only one way to say it.\nHe noticed the charcoal pencils he had gotten for his birthday,\nsettled with a sheet of foolscap, and began to draw. It took\ntwo or three attempts to make the mirror to his satisfaction.\nBy the time he was shading in the last of the matchstick,\nAudrine had returned.\n\"Drawing,\" she said. \"That's good. Something\na gentleman can do. Not breaking things, and no rubbish in\nthe parlor. Very good, Rene. I'm glad you've learned your\nlesson.\" She leaned over his shoulder. \"It's good,\ntoo. A lovely still life.\"\n\"Sufficiency,\" he said.\nTheir eyes met, and a shudder of understanding passed through\nher. \"How do you do it?\" she whispered.\n\"I've always talked to them. I always knew how.\"\n\"Who are they?\"\n\"They come from the stars. They just want to understand.\"\nShe shuddered again. \"So do I.\"\nRene shrugged helplessly and shoved the drawing at her. \"Sufficiency,\"\nhe said. \"I couldn't make it for real, but I thought\nyou might see it. If you'll get me the things, maybe I could\nreconstruct it. Then you'd see.\"\n\"No,\" said Audrine. \"Oh, no. It's -- it's that\nagain. What you've been doing all along.\"\n\"But now you're listening.\"\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\"Yes, you do. You saw Sufficiency. Here, I'll do another.\"\nHe cast about his room for the objects that made something\nsimple. He saw his wooden horse, a sock, and a harmonica.\nPerfect for Breadth. He started to lay them down.\n\"No,\" she whispered.\nHe looked up.\n\"You little star-touched thing,\" she said. \"I\ncan't make anything else of you. It would be folly to try.\"\nHe waited.\n\"But that's all they want of me, do you understand? To\nwipe your nose and make you mind.\"\n\"But I can still --\"\n\"I won't do it.\"\nShe plucked the pencil from his hand and shoved it into the\nmiddle of the bedclothes. Working swiftly she found his shoehorn\nand a box of hairpins from her pocket.\nShe made for him Decision.\nHe never saw her face again. Or any other.\nThe aliens buzzed. \"Tell us again about star charts.\"\n\"Tell us icon.\"\n\"Tell us organza.\"\n\"Tell us.\"\nRene picked up his pencil again and started to sketch.\nThe\nEnd","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20051030133631\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/janmar2003\/portraitoftheartist.htm","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/9z9AGoYjCLzIA+NRAnOAqf1yZAk.json","volume":4.0,"issues":1.0,"has_text":true}

Schmidt","hostname":"wouldthatitwere.com","date":"2000-07-01","categories":"","tags":"Historical, SF, Science Fiction, Victorian","id":null,"license":null,"comments":null,"text":"Timeless Stray\nIt was said of Madame Franchot that she could read the future like an open book. Her fame, a matter of no consequence in the days when her Soho parlor (a bare-floored hovel just three steps above the open sewer) was titled \"Reader of Tarot\", became a matter of public talk when she moved just blocks from Buckingham Palace and her parlor, a confection of thick rugs, dim lighting and silver tea service, was titled simply \"Seer\".\nThe stories flew from lips to ears:\n\"Madame Franchot predicted the sinking of that Navy ship of the Admiralty.\"\n\"Madame Franchot told the Queen\u2019s cousin he\u2019d be appointed Viceroy.\"\n\"She showed the Prime Minister how the elections would end if he backed the Tariff Bill.\"\n\"She\u2019s not even French!\"\n\"That gypsy has spies everywhere.\"\n\"I heard she\u2019s been seeing the Queen at night, when the Palace Guards disguise her as a footman and they sneak her in through the coal cellar.\"\n\"She knows too much and that will be the death of her.\"\nMadame Franchot, whose Gallic nature was entirely dependent upon her pseudonym, reveled in the gossip. The more outrageous, the better. She was certainly not above spreading some of it herself, dropping the tiniest of hints in her daily \"tea chats\" and feigning a monumental combination of indifference and reticence when discreetly questioned about the revealed topic. As the days passed and her fame grew, the moments of conscience became fewer and weaker, the minutes spent before the mirror loathing her horsey features dominated by teeth that were frightful in their effect began to fade into memory as Rebecca Mudd melted into the past and Madam Franchot crystallized her future.\nThe days of scrabbling for twopence over a wooden floor and a heavy brush were gone. Her hands, once roughened red and calloused had become soft and quite elegant. The face, disfigured even further by malnutrition and early wrinkles, had regained a touch of whatever youthful luster it may have had, aided by fashionable wigs and the finest cosmetics of two continents. In the quietest corner of her soul she carried the memory of that night when, after two weeks of nothing but water and scraps found in slop buckets, she offered herself to a ghastly derelict and was haughtily scorned. Oh how that moment burned in her heart! In the deepest night she would sometimes awaken to the crackling sound of that wretched laughter, driving her like steely hail down the darkest filth-strewn alley she had ever seen. There, humiliated beyond endurance, she flung herself atop a squishy pile of fetid rot and sobbed tearlessly.\nShe recalled how the thought emerged unbidden, more like the end of a process than a new thought altogether: Within that pile of putrid waste had to be something sharp\u2026\nHer hands plunged into the morass and shoved aside waves of stench, her eyes flickering to and fro in the dimmest starlight. She would find something, anything sharp enough to sever arteries and veins and would add her filth to the pile.\nThe faint whir frightened her. Rats! She scrambled back, gibbering, her pain fleeing in terror. For almost a minute she breathed harshly, her entire body straining to determine where the rats were.\nThe whir came again, like that of an umbrella being twirled. Not rats, then, but something else\u2026maybe something valuable.\nHope does spring eternal, and Rebecca moved back to the pile, aware now of its stench and chilly touch. Slowly, anticipating another sound, she plunged her hands deeper into the rot. Whirrrrr\u2026and her hands seized a box, vibrating slightly and warmer than the surrounding garbage.\nOut of feral instinct, she looked all around, muffling the faint sound with her body. The box was made of a smooth metal, silky to the touch, and its vibrations were steady.\nRebecca\u2019s ears strained for the sound of footsteps, more likely stumbling than steady in this part of London. Nothing. Scrabbling quickly to the edge of the alley\u2019s entrance, she peered up and down the deserted street, aware of the distant boisterous laugh of an illegal pub and moved away from the sound, deeper into the city, where with care, light could be found and used for study.\nThe gaslight near the park even had a bench. Rebecca sat there, tense, aware her time would be limited as bobbies and other malcreants made their rounds. The box sat carefully on her lap, its dark gray surface seeming to hold light rather than reflect it. About a foot long, maybe eight inches wide and two inches high, the box was not as heavy as the metal would predict. A knurled button was all that broke its smooth surfaces, and Rebecca first pressed it, then flicked it upward, but to no avail. Rushing, she slid her thumb over it to and fro and with a sharp click, the box opened.\nCHAPTER TWO\nIt was Soho that gave her a home, one rented on a weekly basis from the meager farthings of small-time gamblers. It was often horses that they bet on, stumble-bum animals delaying the knacker for yet another week, but their attraction to hoodlums and bookies were the milk of prosperity for Rebecca.\nIt was only after several months of effort that she finally felt ready to transform herself, to rise above the Mudd as she grimly told herself every night and become somebody important. The box revealed its mysteries with the reticence of a peer bestowing charity. At first, all she could see in the box were the vaguest of images, fleeting glimpses of people, places and things she barely understood. Most of what she saw was simply unbelievable, like the huge silver arrows crossing the skies and wheeled carriages moving without horses. There was a sense of reality to these images that was very distressing to Rebecca, for she felt she could do so much if only she understood\u2026\nIt was chance rewarded by hours of effort when Rebecca saw a list of familiar names, those of horses running for their very lives. With a quick word, she made her knowledge a topic of rumor and a basis for income.\nMany more hours passed over several months, the pain in her eyes and head becoming atrocious as she tried to wring true power from the infinite images that paraded through the box. Whatever the small buttons inside did was beyond her ken, but slowly, with the tiniest of advances, Rebecca was able to guide the images to her liking, and in doing so, achieve her ambitions. Slowly, steadily, with ever-increasing reach, Madame Franchot became first a fortune teller\u2026then she became a collector of fortune.\nCHAPTER THREE\n\"It is preposterous!\" roared the large man, dressed in old-fashioned clothing heavy in the wool and dark in color. Murchison, his lanky frame moving smoothly once again, entered the office as Leeds blinked his response.\nThe large man, his walrus-like moustache bristling in repressed fury, slammed his hands on the dark teak armrests and fairly burst to his feet. He whirled and pointed a short fat finger at Murchison. \"Who is this man?\"\nMurchison walked through the gesture and perched his hip on the leftmost desk, the messy one with the open gravitic condenser. He cocked an eyebrow at his partner.\n\"Sir Hawthorne, this gentleman is my partner, Mr. Murchison.\"\nSir Hawthorne, Peer of the Realm, former Chancellor of India and most recently Exchequer to Queen Victoria quivered. \"I know nothing of this man. I shan\u2019t speak to him!\"\nMurchison dug into his vest pocket for the miniature pipe, the tobacco pouch already on the desk. He snorted softly.\n\"Then you may depart with our best wishes,\" replied Leeds mildly.\nEven Murchison paused at that.\nSir Hawthorne sputtered. And spluttered. \"Have you no idea of who I am?\" he barked.\n\"Of course I do,\" shrugged Leeds, fingering the Polish dagger he used as a letter opener. \"But in our office, for our services, you must abide by our rules. I work nothing without Murchison, and vice versa. Now you either agree to that and we continue discussing your situation or you may depart and we remain polite acquaintances.\" His stare was both ice and steel.\nMurchison started to snort, but covered it up by lighting the small pipe fitfully.\nSir Hawthorne tried to meet the stare, but melted before its might. With trembling sigh, he plopped down into the chair. \"Very well. You have your methods.\" He waved a now-feeble hand. \"Will you do me the favor of bringing Mr. Murchison up to date?\"\nA quick nod and Murchison turned to listen. \"Sir Hawthorne\u2019s wife has been spending an inordinate amount of time with a woman known as Madame Franchot. She is an al\u2014\"\n\"Fortune teller, from what I hear, and somewhat accurate.\" Two quick puffs of smoke.\n\"Uh, yes, that\u2019s true. Except that Lady Hawthorne has become, shall we say, a devot\u00e9e of this Madame Franchot and is plying her with ever-increasing amounts of money.\"\n\"Bloody gobs of it!\" boomed the revived Peer. \"It seems this so-called \u2018Lady of the Future\u2019 is charging money for her trivial pronouncements.\"\nMurchison shifted his weight, legs now dangling loosely. \"Many would say that predicting sunken ships and Queen\u2019s appointments is not exactly \u2018trivial\u2019.\"\nSir Hawthorne waved a meaty hand. \"Those were lucky guesses. She has built a web of gossip-mongers that suplies her with enough information for an educated guess. She\u2019s no more a fortune-teller than I am!\" The moustache snapped at air.\nLeeds plopped the dagger down on a neat sheaf of papers. \"That would explain the fees she charges.\"\n\"She calls them \u2018donations\u2019, the strumpet,\" blazed Sir Hawthorne.\nBoth phenomenologists frowned at the outburst. \"You want us to prove she\u2019s a fraud.\"\n\"Mr. Murchison, barring her immediate deportation to Australia, proving she\u2019s a fraud would suit me fine.\" The pause was long enough for a deep breath. \"I\u2019d rather see her dead.\"\nThe phenomenologists stared at each other. \"Sir Hawthorne,\" said Leeds, \"May I caution you about your statements?\" Leeds\u2019 eyes were sharp, his expression severe and grim.\nThe peer harrumphed. \"I say that figuratively. Of course.\" His visage faded from fury to deep anger.\nThe Persian clock ticked loudly. \"Bank account nearing red?\" Murchison\u2019s tone was soft poison, making Leeds shake his head in warning and resignation.\nSir Hawthorne drew himself out of his chair, face mottled and stiff. Murchison kept his eyes on the peer, his pipe glowing faintly. Sir Hawthorne\u2019s fists were clenched in whiteness, his stance a veritable pose of imminent attack. Leeds shifted his weight forward, eyes darting left and right between the two men, one blazing with fury, the other burning with indifference.\nA deep sigh, drawing a bushel of air through the thick moustache. \"I resent the implication, Mr. Murchison, I certainly do, but I also understand that my behavior here has not been quite up to par.\" His fists opened, fingers flexing to relieve the tightness therein. He grunted. \"No, my account remains firmly in the black. I want this nonsense to end and that is why I have come here. I assure you that upon a successful conclusion, your fees will be covered promptly.\"\nNow Murchison reddened slightly, though only Leeds could tell. \"Very well, Sir Hawthorne, we will begin as soon as possible. Murchison and I will arrange to meet this Madame Franchot and test her alleged powers.\" After a heavy pause, the men shook hands with tight awkwardness and Sir Hawthorne departed with ponderous steps.\nOnce the door closed, Leeds said, \"Your mouth, and attitude, occasionally get the best of you, my friend.\"\nMurchison nodded and shrugged, tapping his pipe into the wastebasket. \"Men like him are like waving a red flag in front of a bull.\"\nLeeds walked over to his partner and placed a firm hand on his shoulder. \"A bull cannot help its nature. You can.\"\n\"True,\" smiled Murchison, \"But it does liven up the day.\"\nLeeds laugh was elegantly brief, though quite loud.\nCHAPTER FOUR\nThe sessions at Madame Franchot\u2019s were always scheduled for noon. This allowed for her to rise at a decent hour, prepare her image with care and the help of two ladies-in-waiting and to divine what would show on the always enigmatic box.\nWith delicate touches, Madame Franchot coaxed images from the insidiously puzzling instrument. Flashes of incredible imagery burst across the box\u2019s panel, too fast for Madame Franchot to make sense of them. With barely perceptible twitches of her fingers, she slowed down the images, then shifted their subject matter and focus until finally, after nearly two hours of exhausting effort, she was able to see the familiar sights of London.\nSeveral minutes revealed little: a scandal in the Royal family (a nephew of the Queen whose infamous fondness for scotch whiskey was actually hiding a penchant for laudanum and opium), the iminent collapse of a merchant bank in York and\u2014\nMadame Franchot gasped. She saw her parlor, the guests she had invited that day and\u2014a gun, thrust at her chest and the trigger pulled!\nRebecca had seen her death! From sheer surprise, she yanked her hand from the box, the image vanishing into a nightmarish scene of burning buildings, meaning nothing to Madame Franchot when compared to the shocking scene she had just witnessed.\nHer heart was pounding and her chest felt wrapped in steel bands. A dark sleeve and a hand with a gun\u2026 that was all she saw, but it was enough. Her mouth went dry and pain flared behind her eyes.\nShe wanted so much to cancel the session, to flee from the scene she had captured briefly, but today was Lady Hawthorne\u2019s scheduled day, and she was always good for a hundred quid. Despite her terror, Madame Franchot wanted to keep the money coming in, and so, with enormous will, she dressed, making the barest of conversations with her two ladies and made her way to the quiet parlor. The clock struck twelve, each melodic dong a needle in Madame Franchot\u2019s spine.\nThe visitors to her session filed in, subdued as ever. Except for two men, one short, with thinning hair and bright blue eyes, the other tall, with heavy brown hair and piercing gray eyes. Both were observing her closely, with gazes that she hadn\u2019t felt since her move to Soho.\n\"I beg your pardon, gentlemen, but I cannot remember your appointment with me today.\"\nThe shorter man spoke. \"We made no appointment, Madame Franchot. We are here in representation of Lady J-------, who asks us to beg your forgiveness for her sudden ill health and our unannounced visit.\" The taller man frowned at her, then smoothed his face into a warm smile.\nA hand fluttered. \"Very well.\" Her mind raced. Lady J------ was in constant poor health, and this wasn\u2019the first time she had had to cancel her presence. But who were these men? \"May I have your names, please?\"\n\"I\u2019m Leeds and this is Mr. Murchison.\" His eyes fairly twinkled. \"Shall we be seated?\"\nMadame Franchot nodded yes before she realized she was being subtly manipulated by these two strangers. But the rest of her visitors, having made their deposits in the dark wooden box, were taking their seats along the oval table. Neither stranger was wearing a dark coat, but as the shades we drawn, her heart leapt as the coats became dark and ominous.\nMadame Franchot, cold sweat racing along her back, made her way to the far end of the oval table. There, braced upon a small platform, rested the box that secured her fame. The visitors faded into shadows as she took her place before the box and her trembling hands activated the streaming images.\nColors and shadows shifted as Madame Franchot tried to coax clarity from the chaos. Her usual control was lost, a factor neither Leeds nor Murchison knew as they drank in the strange sights and sounds. Ever so often they would look at each other, levels of surprise registering in their eyes. The night of the elves returned to their minds.\nSuddenly, a subtle twitch clarified an image. It was that of a hospital, British by the nurses\u2019 uniforms, and within it, a man was being tended to frantically. A woman stood up, her skirts rustling as she hurried up to the box, took a look and let out a piercing scream. \"My brother! That\u2019s my brother! He\u2019s dying!\"\nMadame Franchot\u2019s ladies-in-waiting rushed forward and did their best to comfort the distraught woman.\n\"Is that happening now?\" snapped Murchison.\nAll heads turned to him. The frantic woman took a deep breath. \"No, my brother is at home at this moment. But he is scheduled to leave for Algiers on the morrow.\"\nLeeds moved closer to the box. \"How can you be sure that hospital is in Algiers?\"\n\"I can\u2019t,\" moaned the woman, \"All I know is that the man dying there is my brother.\"\nAt that moment, the visitors saw as the doctor slumped back from his patient, his shoulders and arms dropping in the final gesture of impotence before the ultimate end. A nurse drew the bloodied sheet over the man\u2019s face.\nIn the tragic silence, the woman asked: \"He\u2019s dead, isn\u2019t he?\"\nThe silence answered.\nThe woman stood up, her voice a terrible monotone. \"I will do what I must.\" She left the darkened room, more wraith than human.\nLeeds remained near Madame Franchot\u2019s shoulder. He watched closely as she barely touched the box and the images changed in kaleidoscopic fashion. What was this box?\nPictures swooped and sped, flashing across the box\u2019s surface without rhythm or rhyme. Again, suddenly, an image became clear. Vehicles without horses were moving along a street lined with people on both sides.\nThe door burst open and a roaring voice bellowed \"Enough!\" The bulk of Sir Hawthorne filled the doorway, the attention of all but two people centered on the gun in his meaty hand.\nMadame Franchot and Leeds watched as the vehicles crept along. Murchison jumped up. \"Behave yourself, man!\" he spat at Sir Hawthorne. The peer\u2019s eyes shifted to him momentarily.\n\"Hawthorne! What are you doing here?\" Lady Hawthorne\u2019s voice cracked. Madame Franchot turned and gasped as she saw the gun, the arm, the dark sleeve.\nIn the box, a young man, riding inside the open vehicle, waved at the people.\nThe gun was leveled at Lady Hawthorne. \"I have had enough of this witch\u2019s intereference! Get out of here!\"\nSir Hawthorne swung his pistol and aimed at Madame Franchot\u2019s chest.\nA shot was heard.\nLeeds saw the young man twitch.\nMurchison leapt across the table and shoved Madame Franchot away, knocking Leeds down in the process.\nSir Hawthorne fired.\nLeeds saw the young man\u2019s head explode.\nSir Hawthorne saw it too, the tiny image so frighteningly real.\nFour pairs of eyes saw a woman, in a pink outfit splattered with blood, crawl desperately onto the back of the vehicle and a man race forward to stop her from falling off of it. The vehicles sped up and raced away, as the people in the box and those in the room stared, stunned, some shedding tears.\nMurchison pulled the gun from Sir Hawthorne\u2019s hand and ordered one of the ladies-in-waiting to fetch a bobby.\nLeeds reached up to the box, ignoring Madame Franchot\u2019s cry of despair and with a brief touch, erased the image into chaos.\nCHAPTER FIVE\nThe office was subdued, with Murchison perusing documents received from Hong Kong and Leeds trying to make sense of the day\u2019s events.\n\"Do you think Sir Hawthorne\u2019s bullet killed that young man?\"\nMurchison dropped the documents onto his cluttered desk, their contents largely unread. \"I believe so.\"\nLeeds shook his head. \"You saw those vehicles, those people and their clothes. That is not our time. Could the box be a window across time?\"\nMurchison looked at the panel on the south wall that hid the object in question. Three thousand pounds to buy it, silence and Madame Franchot\u2019s disappearance forever. He suppressed a sigh. \"Let\u2019s hope not.\" The Persian clock ticked time, the relentless rush to the future.\nBut both men remained quiet, knowing that simple hope could do very little against stark reality.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20051031124944\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/julysept2000\/timeless_stray.htm","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"Gil's published works include eleven stories, 85 business and science articles and two books on Taino Indian history.

His muttering has\nbeen disturbing the other library patrons and eliciting snickers\nfrom teenagers trying to write their term papers.\n\"Changed again!\" he shouts up to the domed ceiling\nand the huge globe of the Earth dangling from the apex.\nAfter this outburst, I have to approach him. But he looks\nso\non edge. Like he will attack the next person who\ninvades his little research crusade. Of course, it has to\nbe me to confront this nut, since I'm the only librarian on\nduty-Jack, Maurice and Ethel are at a convention in Syracuse.\nThe lucky ones.\nAs I come closer, I'm thinking, what good am I-a fifty-year-old\nbookish woman with graying hair and a thin frame?

An open volume sits under his chin. He\nquickly turns it around and points to the caption under a\npicture I recognize as a battle map: Alexander the Great's\nconquests. Showing his detailed path from Egypt through Asia,\nfrom Babylon to the Indus Valley.\n\"This,\" he says, tracing the dark blue path through\nIndia. \"Never happened. It could not have.\" His\neyes plead with me, and seem to be welling with tears.\n\"Wh- why?\" is all I could think to say.\n\"In 330 BC, Alexander died-in a drunken bar fight with\nthe nobleman, Cleitus.\"\nI take a deep breath, my eyes never wavering from his. I'm\ncalming down a notch. This was strange, definitely, but the\nman wasn't violent. Only\nvery odd. \"No,\" I\nsay softly, easing into the chair opposite him. \"Alexander\nwon that fight. He killed Cleitus, and then, after restoring\ndiscipline among the other disgruntled Macedonian elite, he\nbegan his ruthless campaign against the Indus people, then\nwent on to conquer-\"\n\"I know, I know,\" he mutters, shaking his head,\nand then waving his hands around like he's shooing some bugs.\n\"I've read all about that, read everything since. Seen\nhow so much has changed because of it.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"One little fight\nthat was all.\" His shoulders\nsag and he looks off into space with bloodshot eyes, and I\nrealize he probably hasn't slept in several days. I wonder\nif he has spent some time in other libraries besides mine.\nAnd maybe he'd been kicked out of those as well.\nHe sighs. \"And now you have democratic states, trials\nby jury, United Nations, arena sporting events. All part of\nAlexander's legacy\none that he never finished-at least\nthe way history had been-up until last week.\"\nI blink at him.\n\"You don't remember, do you?\" This is the first\ntime he really focuses on me.\n\"Remember what?\"\n\"How it all was-how it used to be. The global monarchy.\nThe Kahnship, worker drones and slave farms. That's how it\nstarted for me, before I noticed the changes, before I was\nawakened. So many changes, so quickly, and yet\n\"\nhe cocks his head, scanning the room, then me again, looking\nme up and down.\n\"And yet most people still have their same roles. It's\nlike major adjustments to life and social reality occur, but\nit's always the same people living under new conditions-as\nif they never knew of the old version. You, the librarian,\naren't different at all, besides your clothing. And now you're\ngoing to tell me that this history is all you know. Isn't\nthat right?\"\nI nod slowly. \"Of course. How could it be otherwise?\"\nHis palm slams against the table, echoing like gunshots through\nthe library. \"That\n\" he looks away and seems\nto be wrestling with composure, \"is what I'm trying to\nfigure out. Why I come to a library every week, sometimes\nevery day, scrambling to see what's different this time. Why\nare there cars and bikes now instead of horse carriages or\nelemental transports? Why is Canada not all French? What are\nprimary elections, and how did this country get a democracy?\nWho is this Einstein character, what are websites, and why\nhas the Martian colonization never begun?\"\nI shake my head as my lips dry, and at last I simply blink\nat him. What can I possibly say to that? \"Do you need\na doctor? Maybe I could\n\"\n\"Damnit! This isn't real-don't you see? All of you!\"\nHe stands up swiftly, knocking back his chair and pointing\naround to the ashen faces, to the children backing away down\namber-tinted aisles. \"Why bother opening a book? No point\nin learning anything when it all changes on a whim.\"\nI stand, and stupidly I reach for his arm. But he is faster,\nand before I can scream, he has my wrist in his grip. He pulls\nme close and snarls through half-parted lips. \"Or maybe\nit is real, and the world is just re-made every few days,\nwith no one batting an eye. Except for poor, cursed Oliver\nForman. Oliver remembers and sees\n\"\nA commotion rises from my right. Through the corner of my\neye I see with relief the flash of blue uniforms. Two of them\nare approaching cautiously. Someone must have called for help.\n\"Oliver,\" I say softly. \"You need to go quietly\nwith these men. We can talk later, and then-\"\n\"Can we?\" His grip loosens. \"Please, you have\nto\nlisten to me. I'm not crazy.\"\nNo, of course not, I think. You just need to hop back to your\nMartian colony on your elemental transport and you'll be back\nto normal.\n\"Maybe I can convince you, and the next time it happens\n\"\nHis expression falls when he hears the approaching footsteps.\n\"But no, you won't remember. Whatever it is, I think\nit sweeps across everything-matter, flesh, minds-and reshapes\nthem, including memories. You'll only know the new version.\"\n\"I'm sure that's not the case, Oliver.\" It sounds\nstupid, but it's all I can think to say as security gently\npulls the man up and places him in cuffs.\n\"It is!\" he shouts, head down as he is led to the\nstairs. \"It's happening, maybe it's always happened,\nbut now I can tell. I'm aware, and I know it'll happen again.\"\nThe minute he leaves, I swear the room brightens and the air\nfeels lighter. And as everyone breathes a relieved sigh, and\nas I start to clean up his books, I can't help but feel a\nsudden shudder down my spine. It happens as I glance at the\npages of another book which is opened to a study of the Roman\nEmpire, and the thought strikes me with unsettling force.\nWhat if\n?\nWhat if that empire had never emerged? Could there have been\nisolated, small events that might have kept it from forming\nor rising to power? Of course there could-I knew that, just\nas any student of history knew. Herodotus was the first to\nspell it out: that great shifts in history were often decided\nby the actions of minor players; out of the way events led\nto the most dramatic impacts on the lives of great leaders,\nand on the whole fate of nations.\nThat's true, but what if\nwhat if history, or reality,\nkeeps experimenting, trying different outcomes, testing alternate\npaths?\nI'm not much of a science fan, but I recall enjoying a theory\non quantum physics, and the possibility of an infinite number\nof outcomes, multiple universes created from each possible\nvariation. String theory and dimensional layering. It was\nall so complex, yet intriguing.\n-And somehow disquieting in the face of Oliver Forman's pleas.\nI am so lost in thought that I almost don't notice the young\nlady who places a book down on the desk beside me, along with\nher library card.\nI take the book and the card to the front desk, where I scan\nthe inside cover, collect a ten cent fine from the girl, then\ntell her she has three weeks to read and return this book.\nIt is one I had read a couple months ago; I thought was full\nof truly excellent research into the short life and the abrupt\nassassination of a Cuban revolutionary named Castro.\nTwo\nThey\nlet me see Oliver two days later. He is in Rochester General's\npsychiatric ward, third level. The doctors tell me that they\nhave left him alone all morning, preferring he saw no one\nuntil my visit. Apparently, my presence is all he's been asking\nfor.\nI must admit, I am intrigued and more than a little disturbed\nstill from his ranting. His utter sincerity about such ridiculous\nideas have shaken me, and earlier tonight, during my last\nfew hours at the library, I found myself scanning several\nof the titles in the recent history section, wondering if\nperhaps, some of them didn't seem quite like they belonged.\nAs if a part of me understood that maybe it wasn't always\nthe case that the Chinese put the first men on the moon, or\nthat maybe Libyans hadn't really blown up the Lincoln tunnel\ntwo years ago-or that maybe the German Chancellor and the\nBritish Prime Minister hadn't signed that mutual expansion\npact in 1934.\nI know, I know-you're thinking I'm just letting him get to\nme\nbut really, what if those things weren't the way\nevents really happened? I mean, maybe technology would have\ntaken a different, slower path. Would I be standing here,\nstill in my apartment, through will alone, merely projecting\nmy image through our cerebral Interlink, to the holo-emitter\nin Oliver's cell?\nHonestly, I'm not sure. Maybe things would have been different,\nmaybe not. In any case, I settle down, close my eyes and let\nthe projector create for me the interior view of Oliver's\nconfinement chamber.\n\"Hello Oliver,\" I say calmly-and nearly scream when\nmy sudden virtual appearance rocks him into a state of hysteria.\nI see white-clad men with green skull caps glide into the\nroom. One of them inserts a sonic hypo into his temple.\nHe is calm in moments, and they quickly leave.\n\"Oliver?\" I say again.\nThis time he whimpers. \"It's happened again.\"\nI sigh. Why did I expect any different? \"Oliver, what\ndo you want from me?\"\nHe curls up, hugging his knees, refusing to look at my projection.\n\"Library,\" he says at last. \"Need to get to\nthe library. Tell them you'll do it. They can guard me all\nthey want-I just need to be there. Have to have access to\nyour books, see what's different this time. What created this\nyou. Them\nlike it is now.\"\n\"Oliver, I\n\" The thought crosses my mind again-this\nis an intelligent man, but one who has obviously undergone\nsome sort of brutal assault on his mental framework. I am\nsure he just needs the proper medication, but at the same\ntime, I'm intrigued about how he could fabricate and actually\npinpoint some historical oddity and imagine its antecedent\neffects.\n\"Okay,\" I tell him. \"I'll talk to your doctors.\nBut you have to agree to tell me what you think you've discovered.\nIs that a deal?\"\nOliver nods, but slowly, and with less enthusiasm than I had\nexpected-as if he fears my involvement, perhaps thinking I\nmight wind up like him and hoping to spare me the same agony.\nAfter shutting off my individual power reactor, I step in\nsight of the wall mirror and have to grin to myself. I am\nfifty years old, but still quite attractive, with a fine shape.\nThe nutrio-solvents which feed me through the bed-chassis\nreally work wonders on the human skin and muscle definition.\nI often wonder how badly I would have aged if not for such\ndevices.\nOh well. The next minute I receive a blip from my brain cap,\nthe link which keeps me up to date on news events and stores\ncorrespondence mail. Most well-to-do citizens have them, and\nI'm grateful that the Library offered employee discounts so\nthat I could afford the latest model.\nI access the news feed as I go about my nightly preparations,\nand learn that the first elections are finally set for next\nweek at the unified Martian colonies. I sigh, recalling how\nmany years after the bloody revolts it has been, and at last,\na peaceful government will be constructed.\nHistory never slows down, I say to myself. It just keeps coming.\nMy nutriobath is ready in the bedroom, and I'm hungry. Tomorrow\nis another big day.\nThree\nWhen\nI arrive at the library shortly after noon, Oliver is there,\nat his usual table. A uniformed escort stands a dozen feet\nback; I note the long, serrated scimitar attached to his belt.\nDamn, I didn't expect the hospital to send an actual warrior\nto guard this pitifully weak person. And wasn't every able-bodied\nman supposed to be out on the southern front, defending our\nland against the Aztec threat?\nI shake my head as I approach Oliver. He hears me coming-actually,\nhe hears my thumping cane as I stick it forward and lean heavily\non it. My emaciated left leg-deteriorating faster than the\nHealers expected-has given me a lot of pain this week. Fortunately,\nI can still make it to work, still tend the shelves and dust\nthe scrolls. I glance around quickly and take in the sight\nthat always brings me such joy-walls a hundred feet tall,\nwith alcoves nine feet deep, categorized and absolutely full\nof parchments and rolled inscriptions collected from across\nthe world, even surpassing that initial wonder at Alexandria.\nNow, my library is but one of hundreds across the civilized\nEmpire.\n\"No\n\" Oliver whispers, seeing me approach.\nHis eyes are wide, his mouth open. Then, he simply sighs.\n\"It's happening faster now, speeding up.\"\nI lean on my cane. \"You're telling me it's all different\nagain?\"\n\"Yes, damn it! Two days ago you were just a projection\nin my cell. There were mental connection links across the\nglobe. All due to monumentally advanced technology which arose\nfrom the lack of religious influence.\" His expression\nturns enthusiastic and his hands wave about the air. \"The\nRoman Emperor Constantine never abolished the heresies of\nBishop Origen at Nicea, never went on to codify Christianity\nand exclude the other doctrines of religious tolerance which\nhad prevented the pursuit of scientific enlightenment.\"\nI blink at him. \"All that happened, Oliver. Constantine\nand-\"\n\"Not the last time around. Don't you see? No Dark Ages,\nno suppression of intellectual progress; no excommunication\nthreat to Galilleo for saying the world is just a round, insignificant\nball in the cosmos.\"\nSighing, I take a seat in front of him. \"Oliver, you're\nvery confused. Just relax. I know I told you to let me know\nwhat you discover, but you have to make sense. I don't know\nthis Galilleo person you're talking about.\"\n\"Of course not,\" he almost spits the words out.\n\"Because just an hour ago, history was altered again.\nThis time it was easy to notice because when I came in here\nthese scrolls were electronic disks, that guard was a synthetic\nbeing, and\n\" He glances at the walls, then back\nat the guard. Then he starts rifling through a series of parchments\non the table.\n\"Oh, what's the use? Obviously, by the style of your\ndress, the architecture of this place, and the writing on\nthese scrolls-we're in a Moslem world. I'm guessing the Crusades\nweren't a success?\"\nI smile and shake my head. He must know this-every child knew\nour glorious past by the age of eight. \"Oh, the Christians\nheld their own-but only until 1135, when the Europeans lost\ninterest in a Holy War. Not enough glory or promise of fame.\nUnlike our wondrous Islam, where our holy generals pressed\nahead, recaptured Jerusalem, then decimated Rome by the middle\nof the twelfth century.\"\nHe narrows his eyes at me. Then slowly nods, as if figuring\nthe whole thing out. \"The Knights Templar! Ever heard\nof them?\"\n\"No.\"\nThen he does a curious thing: he smiles and claps his hands\ntogether. \"I'm betting that for some reason Hughes de\nPayen never calls together his initial group of pure knights\nto defend Jerusalem and the Christian travelers through the\nheretic lands. Their ranks never grow, noblemen never give\ntheir treasures and castles over to their cause; and their\nvast power and military might does not arise to repel the\nMoslems. A century later, Jacques de Molai doesn't recant\nhis heretical confession before Pope Clement and Phillip IV,\nand by his tragic example, lead to the founding of several\nother orders of religious Knights to take up the Templar's\ncause.\"\nI have to smile-this man's mind is truly a wonder. Allah alone\nunderstands how someone can concoct such a false history so\nquickly, and profess it with utter belief. I open my mouth\nto tell him just how heretical he sounds, and how he ought\nto lower his voice-when he suddenly contorts. His body twitches\nand his flesh actually seems to ripple, as if hooks were passing\nunder his skin.\nWhen he glances up at me his eyes are alert and pain-free.\nHis convulsions have stopped, and in their place is a trembling\nexcitement. He lifts the oversized, leather-bound encyclopedia\nand gleefully fans through hundreds of pages at once. Smiling\nat me, he says: \"And I suppose you don't remember this\nbeing just a scroll a minute ago?\"\nI stand up quickly and pull the book from his hands. Briskly,\nI walk to the nearest return cart. This has gone far enough.\nNow he is just playing with my head-or else he is truly, tragically\ninsane. I notice him staring at my legs.\n\"What?\" I say, after dropping the book off. I turn\naround in a quick circle. I don't have the best legs, but\nthey're not bad for a slender fifty-year-old librarian. \"Want\na better look?\"\nOliver's head twists around and he stares at the security\nguard as if the plainly dressed man has just turned into a\nwerewolf. He grudgingly reaches for another book in front\nof him, and leafs through a few pages. Shakes his head, and\nthen, abruptly stops as his body twitches once more. I fear\nhe's going into some kind of fit.\nHis eyelids flutter and his face pales. Then, relaxing just\nas suddenly, he looks up and focuses on the great Quetzal\nSerpent emblem beautifully painted on the domed ceiling.\nHe shoots me a glance, and those eyes hold a sadness I have\nnever seen in anyone before. His frame goes limp, and as he\nsettles his head onto the table it seems he is deflating,\nall enthusiasm and life ebbing. \"Can't\ntake any\nmore.\"\nI nod to the eagle-helmeted guard as I cautiously approach.\nHis feathery cloak rustling, the guard moves quickly to lift\nOliver and lead him again from my knowledge temple.\nWhen he is gone, I gather the clay tablets and set them aside\nto put away later. Now, I feel exhausted, as if the confrontation\nwith this poor insane man has left me mentally drained. Tezcapla\nwill see to him, if He wills it.\nI make the next turn around a mahogany-lined shelf, taking\ntime first to straighten my black suit and ensure the armband\nis secure. Above me, the immense red Swastika sways on a flag\nin the vents' subtle breezes. I've always done my part to\nkeep the Fuhrer's history intact, burning those volumes which\nwe knew were lies, preserving those relating to our glorious\nAryan past. This deluded Oliver-I hope the Gestapo go easy\non him. The mere suggestion that our Reich could have been\ndefeated fifty years ago is such vile slander that I fear\nthe worst will come to him.\nI shudder momentarily, and feel as if something intangible\njust passed through me. I look at myself, as if the appearance\nof my regulation silver jumpsuit could betray something out\nof the ordinary. But of course, nothing is amiss.\nAnd as I step onto the next pad and float to level seven-the\nHistories-I wonder about my earlier thoughts of dimensional\noverlaps and quantum shifts; of infinite possibilities, unlimited\npasts and unsketched futures.\nThen I have the horrifying impression that reflecting on these\nthings, and perhaps truly understanding them, might open a\nPandora's Box from which could issue something truly dangerous\nto the human mind accustomed to only one reality-some level\nof awareness of the seamless, interlocking whole.\nBut I shake this foolish notion away as soon as my sandaled\nfeet tread the dust of the third floor. Level with a heavy\nwooden cross dangling from the center dome, I carry the weathered\nvolumes to their crusty shelves, knowing that soon, another\nmight come to extract these tenderly maintained historical\ntruths.\nAnd I will be there, as always, to assist and to hold sacred\nthe past as it has always been.\nThe\nEnd","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20051030133631\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/janmar2003\/pasttense.htm","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/m1Je27kICOIMawfB4-oO27UDLhY.json","volume":4.0,"issues":1.0,"has_text":true}

He closed his eyes\nand concentrated, but all he could hear was the beating of his own heart and the\nrasping of his breath.\nDamn that Sherlock Holmes,\nhe thought. What was he doing\nhere anyway? If he\u2019d discovered\nthe information I planted back at the museum, he should be more than a day west\nof London by now.\nMoriarty adjusted the\nheavy satchel he carried and started down the tunnel once again. Piles of broken stone and debris slowed his progress.\nThe tunnel wound down and he almost slipped several times on the slippery\nslope of the uneven floor.\nHolmes knows me too well,\nhe decided. We\u2019ve crossed\npaths too many times and he\u2019s learning to anticipate me.\nThe information I left for him must have been too obvious and he\nrecognized it as a false clue.\nHe stumbled and bumped\nthe wall. The priceless Shanshadar\nstones inside his bags rang like tiny chimes.\nMoriarty smiled to himself. I\nsuppose we both know each other too well. There\nwas no reason to suspect Holmes would discover my smuggling operations here in\nthe abandoned mines above Lowestoft, north of London. Still, I had this escape route prepared.\nWith luck it will be an hour or more before he discovers it and he tries\nto follow me.\nProfessor Moriarty\nslowed down as he sensed the widening of the tunnel ahead.\nHe stopped and raised his lantern. Before\nhim, the tunnel abruptly stopped and fell away, opening to a large chasm more\nthan forty feet across. Leaning\nforward, he held the lantern high, but the flame of the light was too dim to\nilluminate the depths that stretched more than a hundred feet below.\nHe listened closely and heard the distant sound of rushing of water at\nthe bottom of the dark abyss.\nYears ago, when the\nmine was still in operation, this section of tunnel had collapsed to reveal an\nunderground river that rushed to the sea. This\nside branch was unused long before the mine had ceased its operations.\nIt didn\u2019t even appear on any of the old company charts.\nHe set his lantern down\nand reached up to find the rope and pulley he\u2019d had installed.\nHe pulled on the rope and the pulley creaked noisily.\nIt took considerable effort, but the heavy metal cart suspended from the\nrope slowly worked its way toward him. In\nmoments, Moriarty had loaded his bag into the basket and carefully climbed\naboard.\nThe rope sagged\nthreateningly and he found himself concentrating with all his might to ignore\nthe emptiness that opened beneath him. He\nmethodically pulled on the rope and slowly worked his way across.\nOnce on the other side, he held onto the rope and tossed his bag to the\nopposite ledge. Then he\nunceremoniously tumbled out of the cart and lay on the ground, gasping.\nHis heart pounded loudly in his chest and he thought to himself.\nThere. That might not\nstop Holmes, but it will surely slow him down.\nAs a matter of fact, with that fool Watson in tow, this may stop him from\nfollowing me altogether.\nHe decided this was the\nideal opportunity to deal with that meddling fool Holmes once and for all. He looked at his watch.\nIt was ten minutes to four. He\nstill had plenty of time to make his getaway, so he decided to wait.\nMoriarty closed the\ncover of the lantern, darkening it, and set it out of sight around the bend of\nthe tunnel. Then he pulled the rope\nto take the cart back to the other side where Holmes would find it. Then he took a comfortable seat on the ground and waited for\nhis old nemesis.\nSitting in the dark, he\nstarted to make new plans. Most of\nthe valuables he\u2019d stolen from London\u2019s museums over the past several months\nwere all crated up back in the main tunnels and were waiting for transfer to\nprospective buyers on the continent. All\nhe\u2019d managed to get away with were a few religious relics from the India\nexhibit.\nHe opened his bag and\npulled out one of the two Shanshadar stones.\nOf the assortment of minor treasures he carried, these were the most\nprecious. There were only three\nknown to exist and he had two of them. They\nwould fetch a handsome price and would be more than sufficient for him to\nrebuild his operations somewhere else. As\nhe looked at the stone, he was surprised to see it glowed with a strange\npreternatural blue light. He\nhadn\u2019t noticed the glow before.\nMusing, he reflected on\nthe legend of the stones. They were\nof indeterminate origin, but legends about them went back more than three\nthousand years. They purportedly\nhad magical properties and, if one knew how, they could be used to alter\nreality, to \u2018unweave Mara\u2019s Web\u2019.\nMara was the Indian\ngoddess of illusion, who could allegedly create false images so real that they\ncould even fool the other gods. Her\ngreatest illusion, of course, was supposed to be the world itself.\nThis illusion, Mara\u2019s Web, distracted mankind and blinded him to the\ntrue nature of reality. They had\nbeen hidden for centuries and cherished as religious relics.\nHe shoved the stone\nback into the bag and stared back at the tunnel opening opposite him.\nDamn, he thought again.\nWhy does Holmes have to interfere with everything I do?\nWhy doesn\u2019t he bother someone else? If\nhe worked for Scotland Yard, I could understand, but his obsession with me seems\npersonal. Even as he pondered the matter, however, he knew the\nanswer. Holmes was as bored as he\nwas and there was really no one else capable of giving him a real challenge.\nAs much as he hated the egotistical interloper, he had to admit he held a\ngrudging respect for Holmes. No one\nelse even came close to being a match for Moriarty.\nAfter about ten\nminutes, a noise from the other side of the chasm attracted his attention.\n\u201cI say, Holmes, is it\nmuch further? Why are we blundering\ndown this dingy little tunnel anyway?\u201d\nMoriarty smiled to\nhimself. It was that fool Watson\nthat Holmes always kept around. If\nSherlock had any weakness it was that idiot associate of his.\n\u201cBecause Moriarty was\npresent when we arrived here at the mines.\nYou saw his carriage outside and you know he left his contact at the\ndocks a mere hour ago. He can\u2019t\nbe more than a few minutes ahead of us and this is the only path he could have\ntaken. Now hurry up, Watson, or he\u2019ll get away.\u201d\nHolmes sounded stressed\nand nearly as frustrated with Watson\u2019s constant whining as Moriarty.\nThe professor sat quietly in the dark and waited for the right moment to\ncome.\n\u201cAh, what do we have\nhere?\u201d said Holmes as he reached the end of the tunnel.\nWatson appeared with a lantern and Moriarty\u2019s two pursuers were\nbrightly silhouetted on the other side of the chasm.\n\u201cAn underground river and a convenient conveyance, undoubtedly for\nMoriarty\u2019s escape.\u201d\nMoriarty heard Holmes\ntug on the rope and the rusty pulley squeaked loudly.\n\u201cYes, the rope and supports are sound,\u201d Holmes said.\n\u201cIt should be adequate to hold both our weights.\nQuickly Watson, get in the cart. I\u2019ll\nsteady it for you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d exclaimed\nWatson. \u201cYou want me to get in\nthat flimsy little thing?\u201d\n\u201cYes, and don\u2019t\ndawdle. Moriatry is probably\ngetting further away every moment,\u201d Holmes replied.\nThere was grunting and\ngroaning, presumably as Watson maneuvered his bulk into the cart.\nMoriarty waited, but heard a pause as Holmes apparently hesitated.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get\naway, Moriarty,\u201d Holmes shouted across the chasm.\n\u201cI know you\u2019re there waiting and listening in the dark. I\u2019ve already notified Inspector Lestrad at Scotland Yard.\nHe should be arriving momentarily. I\neven left a note at your headquarters behind us informing him about this little\nbolthole of yours and advising him to get his men positioned at the base of the\ncliffs where this tunnel undoubtedly exits.\nYou can\u2019t escape and you\u2019re only delaying the inevitable.\nWhy don\u2019t you admit defeat and give up now?\u201d\nBile rose in\nMoriarty\u2019s throat. How dare\nHolmes presume to know he was still here? There\nwas absolutely no way he should suspect he would interrupt his own escape to\nloiter here in the dark.\nWith considerable\neffort, Moriarty restrained himself and remained silent.\nAfter perhaps a full minute, Watson spoke.\n\u201cIs he really over\nthere, Holmes? How can you\ntell whether or not he\u2019s sitting there in the dark over there waiting for us\nto follow in this deathtrap?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not there,\nWatson. I assure you. I know Professor Moriarty far better than you think.\nIf he were waiting there, there\u2019s no way he could have resisted\nresponding to my challenge and my insult. His\nego is too great to permit that type of affront.\nI was just taking the precaution, in case he was desperate enough to wait\nfor us to follow him.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean it\u2019s safe\nto cross over then?\u201d asked Watson.\n\u201cMost assuredly,\u201d\nanswered Holmes.\nA few moments later,\nHolmes joined Watson in the cart and together they started to pull themselves\nacross the cavern. Moriarty was\nfuming. He was so mad that, for a\nsecond time, he almost shouted at Holmes when he announced his smug conclusion\nto Dr. Watson. Gloating silently,\nMoriarty waited until the cart was halfway across the abyss. Then he stood quickly and grasped the rope, abruptly stopping\nthe cart\u2019s forward progress.\n\u201cSo my ego is too\ngreat to withstand your insults, is it, Holmes?\nYou think I haven\u2019t the discipline or self control to wait for you to\nmake a fatal mistake?\u201d he said.\nHolmes did not respond,\nbut Watson cried, \u201cOh, my God. What\ndo we do now, Holmes?\u201d\nMoriarty reached with\nhis other hand and pulled a folding knife from his pocket.\nThen he started to saw through the thick rope, which held up the metal\ncart and its two occupants. Even as\nhe severed the rope, he heard Holmes start to scramble out of the cart and\nattempt to climb up to the rope.\nToo late, he thought. The rope separated and the cart tumbled into the darkness.\nWatson dropped the lantern and flailed wildly.\nMoriarty watched the two men fall helplessly into the depths below.\nWatson screamed like a\nchild all the way down. Holmes\nnever made a sound. There was loud\ncrash and the sound of metal breaking on rock.\nThe light of the lantern sputtered out, but not before he verified the\nbroken bodies of Holmes and Watson on the distant jagged rocks.\nThen there was only darkness and the sound of rushing water once more.\nMoriarty stood quietly\nand reflected on his victory. After\na few moments, the excitement of dispatching Holmes faded and the sweet taste of\nvictory turned sour in his mouth.\nIt\u2019s sad, he thought.\nNo one else ever challenged me. No\none else understood what I was doing, even when I was doing it right under their\nnoses.\nHe opened his bag and\nlooked at his precious religious relics. The\nexcitement of selling them now seemed diminished.\nWithout the thrill of the chase, without Holmes nipping at his heals, it\nwasn\u2019t going to be nearly as enjoyable. As\nhe mused, he realized he was even going to miss Dr. Watson.\nIndeed, confounding Watson was the most fun of all.\nWatson typified the erudite ignorance of society\u2019s elite, the fools who\nwere waiting to be fleeced, but were so stupid that someone like Holmes had to\nexplain everything to them.\nDamn, he thought once more. What\nhave I done?\nHe stood and looked\ndown into the abyss. He reached\ninto his bag and pulled out one of the dim glowing stones.\nIn winning this final victory, he\u2019d denied himself the joy of endless\nvictories. There was no one left to\nappreciate how truly brilliant he was. Now\nthere would be no one to explain his genius to the dullards at Scotland Yard.\nHis successes and his fame would now disappear in obscurity.\nHe squeezed the Shanshadar stone in his hands and regretted exacting his\nfinal vengeance.\nIn a fit of rage he\nthrew the stone to the ground and it shattered into a thousand pieces. There was a brilliant blast of blue light and he saw tendrils\nand snakes of energy weaving and twisting before him. Like living lightning, the blue strands expanded and grew.\nEverything they touched turned brilliant blue and then disappeared.\nEntire sections of the cavern walls vanished as if consumed.\nOne undulating ribbon of light reached for him and he backed\ninvoluntarily to the tunnel wall. It\ndrove itself into his chest and the world disappeared in a blinding flash.\nMoriarty found himself\nsitting on the ground in the dark. He\nwas holding his bag open and staring at the single glowing Shanshadar stone\ninside. He looked at his watch.\nIt was ten minutes to four.\nBut that\u2019s impossible,\nhe thought. He glanced up and saw\nthe rope and the metal cart in place just the way it had been minutes before.\nHe checked his watch again and wondered if he was hallucinating.\nAm I imagining that everything is as it was ten minutes ago, or did I\nfall asleep and only dream of killing Holmes and Watson?\nBefore he could\nconsider the situation further, there was a sound from the other side of the\nchasm.\n\u201cI say, Holmes, is it\nmuch further? Why are we blundering\ndown this dingy little tunnel anyway?\u201d\nIt\u2019s Watson, he thought. Everything\u2019s happening as it did before.\nIt\u2019s happening all over again.\nMoriarty frowned and\nremembered the Shanshadar stone he\u2019d broken.\nThe stories about the stones said they could alter reality and unweave\nMara\u2019s web. Had he somehow gone\nback in time? Was reality replaying\nitself once more? He listened\ncarefully and, sure enough, Holmes replied just as he had before.\n\u201cBecause\nMoriarty was present when we arrived here at the mines.\nYou saw his carriage outside and you know he left his contact at the\ndocks a mere hour ago. He can\u2019t\nbe more than a few minutes ahead of us and this is the only path he could have\ntaken. Now hurry up, Watson, or he\u2019ll get away.\u201d\nMoriarty smiled. It was true. Events\nwere replaying themselves. Reality\nhad unraveled itself somehow and was reweaving itself into place once more.\nHe\u2019d been given the opportunity to re-experience the events of the past\nfew minutes. He knew what was going to happen and what he\u2019d already\ndone. Did he have the power to play\nthe scene differently?\n\u201cAh,\nwhat do we have here?\u201d said Holmes. Watson\napproached with his lantern and Moriarty saw\nthe two of them brightly silhouetted on their side of the deep underground\nravine. \u201cAn underground river and\na convenient conveyance, undoubtedly for Moriarty\u2019s escape.\u201d\nAs before, Holmes\ntugged on the rope and the rusty pulley squeaked loudly.\n\u201cYes, the rope and supports are sound.\nIt should be adequate to hold both our weights.\nQuickly Watson, get in the cart. I\u2019ll\nsteady it for you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d cried\nWatson. \u201cYou want me to get in\nthat flimsy little thing?\u201d\n\u201cYes, and don\u2019t\ndawdle. Moriatry is probably\ngetting further away every moment,\u201d Holmes replied.\nWatson clamored into\nthe cart and Holmes waited for a moment.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get\naway, Moriarty,\u201d Holmes shouted. \u201cI\nknow you\u2019re there waiting and listening in the dark.\nI\u2019ve already notified Inspector Lestrad at Scotland Yard.\nHe should be arriving momentarily. I\neven left a note at your headquarters behind us informing him about this little\nbolthole of yours and advising him to get his men positioned at the base of the\ncliffs where this side tunnel undoubtedly exits.\nYou can\u2019t escape and you\u2019re only delaying the inevitable.\nWhy don\u2019t you admit defeat and give up now?\u201d\nMoriarty smiled. It would be so simple to kill Holmes and Watson again, but\nthat would be no fun. He cried out\nacross the gulf, \u201cYou\u2019re a fool, Holmes.\nI could have easily waited here in silence until you and your incompetent\ncolleague were suspended midway over this abyss. Instead, I will give you a gift.\nI give you your lives.\u201d He\nlaughed manically and sawed with his knife at the rope holding the metal basket.\nWatson scrambled\nfranticly out of the cart and barely made it to safety on the ledge before the\nrope parted and the cart plunged into the darkness below.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get\naway, you know,\u201d cried Holmes. \u201cI\nwill find you and catch you eventually.\u201d\n\u201cTry if you wish, my\ndear Sherlock,\u201d replied Moriarty. \u201cIndeed,\nI sincerely hope you will. Our\npaths will cross again, I promise. Until\nwe meet, remember what a generous man I can be.\u201d\nHe tipped his hat and\nturned hurrying down the tunnel. When\nhe was out of sight, however, he stopped to listen to the exchange between\nWatson and Holmes.\n\u201cHow\ncould you tell he was actually over there, Holmes? How did you know he was sitting in the dark waiting for\nus?\u201d\n\u201cElementary, my dear\nWatson,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what\nI would have done.\u201d\nTurning quickly, Holmes\nheaded back down the tunnel they\u2019d come from.\nCalling back over his shoulder, he shouted, \u201cHurry Watson.\nWe have to get back and explain everything to Lestrad before Professor\nMoriarty gets away. We may still\nhave a chance to catch him.\u201d\nMoriarty grinned\nsilently and picked up his lantern. He\nopened it and hurried to the tunnel exit at the base of the cliffs where a small\nboat waited. As he walked, he\nreached into his bag and gently touched the remaining Shanshadar stone.\nYes, he thought to\nhimself. He and Holmes would meet\nagain someday and they would have least one last time together.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050421124105\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/aprjun2001\/onelasttime.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The Internet's Premier Magazine of Historical Science Fiction","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/AhgtmfQhFr5qmDD7+rT1IcCEyCE.json","volume":2.0,"issues":2.0,"has_text":true}

Not really, but she worried whenever her\nheart speeded up a beat.\nAnything\ncould happen to an old woman alone and they wouldn\u00b9t\nfind her for days and that Lipke -- he couldn't care less,\nwith his cronies and his doorbell ringing and his singing\npractice and his busyness with life that he couldn't\nbe bothered with her, except for the once a month knock\nto deliver the rent.\nHe'd\nsaid no, uh uh, no siree, not him, when she asked about a\nlittle lawn mowing, a little off the rent maybe, but he said,\n\"Mrs. Salloway, I beg your pardon but I had a house and\na wife who was always on me about the lawn. I worked hard.\nOn the weekends a man should not have to do chores. A man\nshould relax with a beer and a ballgame. My wife, she got\nlocal kids who cut in uneven troughs. They would only mow\nwhere the sun was, looking for a tan. She'd give me a 'so there' look to make me say sure sure. I'll\ndo it myself. Hah. I did not. I don\u00b9t mind a crazy lawn.\nWhen that life was over I said, Lipke, at least you\u00b9ve\ngot no more lawns to worry about. So forgive me, but you should\nget a handy man to take care of this place. And that would\nnot be me, is what I'm saying, Mrs. Salloway.\"\nNow\nthat Mrs. Salloway was up she should at least answer the door.\nTurning around she could see the tall slim black stranger,\nyoung, maybe forty, out there on her porch, not smiling, but\nholding up a card too small for her to read from this distance.\nHe\npointed to her door and she walked over, hesitantly. Should\nshe open it to a stranger? He blocked the peephole with the\ncard; the letters all bent in the ball of glass so she could\nsee:\nring but mu\nilling to wor\nnest and dep\nMrs.\nSalloway shook her head. \"Go away from here,\" she\nmade a flapping motion, the way she did to the Pekinese from\nnext door who peed on her peonies, but he slipped the card\nunder the door. She read:\nhearing but mute\nwilling to work\nhonest and dependable\nMust be his name on the back in bigger, blacker letters, tall,\nlike him: Mr. Delmar P. Stood. She opened the door. Mr. Stood\nwas completely clean shaven, his head glowed, back lit by\nthe afternoon sun. He wore a vest and dark pants, a little\ntoo short for his long legs. He said nothing but pointed to\na golf bag on wheels at the foot of the brick steps and, without\nsmiling, pointed again to the bag and made a wide sweep of\nher overgrown front yard, and spindly forsythia bushes on\nthe side of the house.\nWhat\nshould she do? In one hand Mr. Stood held small clippers and\nhe began moving slowly across the porch pruning the hydrangeas\nand rhododendrons. In what seemed like only a minute Mr. Stood\nhad created a large beautiful collection of blooms and held\nthem out to Mrs. Salloway like a hopeful suitor.\nShe\nput up one hand like a stop cop, he shouldn\u00b9t come any\nfurther, as Mr. Stood lay the flowers in her left bent arm,\nlike passing over a new baby, while his other hand rummaged\nin a pants pocket. He pulled out another card that said:\nPlease let me work for you. One meal and one dollar for one\nday. Then he stared at her, how should she\nsay...emotionless!\nMrs.\nSalloway looked at him up and down. Sweat water lined the\ntop of his lip as he stood tall, waiting for a sign from her.\nShould she write NO on a card and pass it to him? Should she\nslam the door? She needed to come up with an answer, a reason,\na vase. Shrugging, she let her chin drop to her bony chest\nto think but before she raised her head to look at him again,\nhe had gone down the steps to his golf bag, pulled out a rake\nand began to work. She stepped back and quietly shut the old\npaneled door. One meal, one dollar for one day. Okay. She'd\nsee how it went. She'd just see.\nFor\nabout four hours Mrs. Salloway watched from first the front\nporch windows then the side. She felt you had to keep your\neye on things because you never knew. And a black man to boot,\nshe said to herself. He was working hard out there, looked\nlike. Made her hungry just watching. Uhf! What was she going\nto make now, for her and for a black man? Her stomach was\nstarting to rumble around. His must be empty and wanting a\nlittle something. The house was so quiet. Only the rake, rake,\nrake, scrape. No radio on now, so she could be alert to whatever.\nMr. Kitty was asleep. Momser upstairs was quiet and Mr. Lipke\nmust be out. Sure. Just like him not to be home.\nWhat\ndid she have in the ice box? What did he have in his mind?\nWhere should she feed him? What about the fact of the single\nfive dollar bill in her good black purse? How could she make\nchange? Could she sneak out a side door and go ask the Hogans,\nthose nice collapsed Catholics next house over, to trade her\nfive ones and call the police if they don\u00b9t see her after\nsupper? Was a sandwich acceptable? Would a black man eat a\nknish from Ketzle's deli?\nIn\nher whole life she only saw the blacks at the Paramount. On\nthe screen with Shirley Temple. Oh, and that Mantan Moreland\nin the Charlie Chan movies. There weren\u00b9t any real life\nones in the town Mrs. Solloway lived in. Which meant they\nmust live somewhere in states down south, but before Florida,\nwhere her sister was. Ida never mentioned the blacks. So there\nmight be special states where they lived, except for the ones\nin the cities all over. In her own back yard was another story.\nMrs.\nSalloway found four quarters in a bowl, mixed in with some\npennies and a few old sourball candies. OK. There was a dollar.\nShe\nsat out on the porch in the fading afternoon. Mr. Stood had\ndrunk water from the outside faucet. He had pruned everything\nin the yard, and edged along the lilacs. The lawn looked greener.\nHow could that be? He did beautiful work, this man. A real\ntreasure. A find. But enough was enough. A person had to eat.\nMrs.\nSalloway waved with both hands as though she were stopping\na train. She had set a small table with an egg salad sandwich\non a nice challa bread. She cut up a pear into slices. She\nfixed some seltzer with a little prune juice for flavor. Exactly\nwhat she had eaten for lunch a few hours before.\nMr.\nStood stopped. He was soaked through his shirt but still looked\ndignified. He had some nice posture, that man. Mrs. Salloway\nwatched as Mr. Stood ran his eyes along the perimeter, nodding\nat his work. She watched as he carefully wiped all his tools\nbefore he put them back in the golf bag. She watched as he\nclimbed the porch steps and waited until Mrs. Salloway indicated\nhe should sit and have a bite to eat. She watched him eat.\nMrs.\nSalloway had made some notes on butcher paper earlier. She\nhad two fat pencils. If this man could write, they could have\na little talk. So to speak.\nShe\nshuffled through the torn pieces of paper she had made.\nWhere\nare you from?\nWhy\ncan't you talk?\nWho\ntold you to come here?\nHow\ndid you get here?\nWhen\nwill you come back?\nMr.\nStood reached out for the whole handful and read them quickly.\nHuh, a smart man, to boot.\nHe\nstared at the old woman, as if judging what he could let her\nknow, never mind maybe figuring out how to express any answer\nthat was not a yes or a no. She didn't want to play word\ngames with him, as if he were a child. This was a man. A dark\nman, but a man. She had never thought such a thing before.\nNot that she would have any reason to think about people who\ndidn\u00b9t live in her world.\nDid\nhe fall asleep there in front of her? He had folded his hands\nand his bald head fell forward. He better not have heatstroke\nor be dead.\nNo.\nHe took a huge gulp of the heavy summer air as though he were\ntasting every beautiful bloom in the yard. Then he reached\ninto a side pocket of the golf bag. He handed over a small\ndisk, like the size of a quarter, then smiled as if he realized\nhe had done a useless thing. Taking back the disk, he pulled\nout a kind of a book without a cover. Professional looking\nthough.\nDissertation\nof D.P. Stood\nEthics of Human Experimentation from 1932-2032.\nMrs.\nSalloway was no dummy. She had been an elementary school teacher\nright up until 1924. She read. She kept up. But she had to\nconcentrate very hard to understand what she had been handed.\nWhile\nshe read, Mr. Stood jotted a few notes on the butcher paper,\nabsently munching on pear slices.\nIt\nsaid that two years from now some doctors in Alabama were\ngoing to trick black men into getting a social disease. The\nUS Public Health Service was behind the idea. A doctor explained,\n\"If the colored population becomes aware that accepting\nfree hospital care means a post-mortem, every darky will leave\nMacon County.\"\nShe\nmouthed slowly, \"No. No. This is America. People don\u00b9t\nhave to love each other, but the US here is where there are\na few guarantees. And no one knows the future.\" Then\nMrs. Solloway bent back to her reading.\nIn 1947, doctors injected plutonium into the left leg of Elmer\nAllen, a 36-year-old African American railroad porter. Three\ndays later, the leg was amputated for a supposed pre-existing\nbone cancer. Researchers analyzed tissue samples to determine\nthe physiology of plutonium dispersion. In 1973, scientists\nsummoned Allen to the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago,\nwhere he was subjected to a follow-up whole body radiation\nscan, and his urine was analyzed to ascertain lingering levels\nof plutonium from the 1947 injection.\nIn\n1949, the Quaker Oats Company, the National Institutes of\nHealth, and the AEC fed minute doses of radioactive materials\nto boys at the Fernald School for the mentally retarded in\nWaltham, Massachusetts, to determine if chemicals used in\nbreakfast cereal prevented the body from absorbing iron and\ncalcium. The unwitting subjects were told that they were joining\na science club.\nIn 1993, DoE Secretary Hazel O'Leary confirmed that the AEC,\nher agency's predecessor, had sponsored experiments in which\nhundreds of Americans were exposed to radioactive material,\noften without their consent.\n\"What\ndoes radioactive mean? That doesn't sound so bad. It\nsounds like a really good model Philco, like I got.\"\nBut Mr. Stood motioned for her to keep reading.\nIn 2009, papers surfaced that documented government laboratories\nduring the second Bush administration. Stem cells from prisoners\non death row, primarily black and Hispanic, were extracted\nfor use in curing high level officials and their families\nof neurological and autoimmune disease. Treatment results,\nwhich were highly beneficial to patients, were never publicized.\nNo benefit to the prisoners\u00b9 families could be uncovered.\n\"What is with these dates? No one can see into the future.\nThe past is hard enough. Is this a fiction book you have?\nYou made this up?\"\nMr.\nStood wrote in small phrases to fit the last of the butcher\npaper.\nCommittee\nrejected my dissertation.\nScholarship stopped.\nOffer from physics and biogenics dept. for lab aide job.\nWould pay and keep me enrolled.\nVolunteered for experiment.\nWoke up in 1930. Campus will be two miles away.\nNo voice. They made sure I have no voice.\nThey think they are safe if people think I\u00b9m crazy.\nThey think they are not murderers.\nThey think they know right from wrong.\nI have no voice.\n\"I\ndon\u00b9t know what\u00b9s what here,\" said Mrs.\nSalloway. \"You seem like a nice, smart man. But nothing has happened.\nWhat you have written can\u00b9t have happened. See? It\u00b9s\nright here. You say 1932. You know it\u00b9s 1930. You know\nthat. You can't know anything else. It's impossible.\nYou have written a scary book. A nightmare. I am sorry for\nyour bad dreams.\"\nMr.\nStood got up.\n\"You\ncan come back.\" She gave him the four quarters. Then\nshe reached into her cobbler\u00b9s apron pocket and pulled\nout the five dollar bill. \"One thing we know is the weeds\nkeep growing. That\u00b9s one thing you can\u00b9t stop.\"\nBut\nMr. Stood went down the porch stairs, picked up his golf bag\nand walked away from the imaginary campus that would or would\nnot be built two miles down the road.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20051030133631\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/janmar2003\/mrssallowayhirsemrstood.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/gW-3z0LiAISwn7f0CTJ8hZN2tos.json","volume":4.0,"issues":1.0,"has_text":true}

My\nhorse reared. The\nground rose up to meet me.\nIt\nhas been some time since then, but I can\u2019t tell how long.\nIt may have been minutes, days or years-I just can\u2019t\nremember. I\nhaven\u2019t even a wall on which to tally the passage of time.\nNot that I could anyway.\nThere are no days here because it is always dark.\nIt is pitch black in fact.\nThe ground is smooth and cold like glass. I\nhave walked endless miles here, on my hands and knees at first.\nI was afraid that at any moment I might stub my foot,\nstrike a tree or fall from some cliff to an unknown depth.\nBut I have encountered nothing.\nThere are no trees or rocks or buildings.\nI smell nothing. Hear\nnothing. I find\nmyself pleading in silence for the trickle of running water or\nthe ringing of a church bell.\nEven the shrill bellowing of my wife would send me into\necstatic glee.\nI\nstop now, fall to my knees and scream.\nMy voice echoes off nothing.\nInstead it is swallowed by the vacuum of space about me.\nI only hear it myself in the back of my ears as if I were\nscreaming under water. I\nslump the rest of the way to the ground and press my face\nagainst the cool surface. I\ncry. My eyes\nsqueeze shut and the tears pool against the smooth surface.\nSomewhere\nthere is sunlight. Somewhere\nthere is grass and my horse is running through it and my wife is\nweeping for me. I hope she is weeping for me.\nPerhaps she is with Ivan the postman.\nThe bastard. Odd,\nI remember his name so vividly.\nMy name is Peter. Thank\nheavens I remember that.\nI\nstand and open my eyes. I\ndon\u2019t know why. It makes no difference whether they\u2019re open or not.\nSomehow when they\u2019re closed I feel blinder.\n\u201cBlinder\u201d. I have gone mad. I could\nbe asleep somewhere. I\ncould be on the ground still or in a hospital.\nMy world could be a nightmare of my own creation.\nI have always been prone to them.\nOnce I dreamt I was in a house made entirely of windows\nand no doors and none of the windows opened.\nThis could be the cellar of that house.\nThunder\nshatters my world. I\u2019m\nriding my horse again. The\nsmell of wet grass is thick and the wind has the last moment of\nrain in it. I\u2019m\ntraveling home and the sun has set.\nI must get there soon or my wife Natalia will scold me. She gets worried when I\u2019m late even five by an hour.\nI think of a hot supper, borsht, bread and good drink.\nThunder\nclaps and a speck of light vanishes into the horizon.\nThere is another flash from behind me and a tiny ball of\nfire streaks across the sky.\nA deafening roar scares my horse and she rears.\nThe\nworld is white. There\nis no shadow. No\ndepth. No definition. I\ncannot tell the sky from the ground.\nThere is no horizon.\nI could be in a giant room for all I know.\nAs I walk, my heels click, sending shards of painful\nnoise bouncing everywhere at once.\nI never find the walls that cause the echo.\nMy\nname is Peter. I\nthink it\u2019s Peter. I\nremember falling off my horse.\nI close my eyes to try to think.\nIt makes no difference.\nI still see white. I could be dreaming. I\nslap myself. It\ndoes no good: I can\u2019t wake up.\nI\nconsider scientific possibilities.\nPerhaps I\u2019m hallucinating.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Perhaps\nI\u2019m somewhere in the ether.\nWhat sense that makes I don\u2019t quite know, but the\nthought comes to me just the same and it has a ring of truth to\nit. I remember a\nlight, a ball of fire. It\ncould have been a comet, a meteor.\nIt\u2019s affected me.\nNo, perhaps it\u2019s killed me.\nI must be mad.\nSomething\nis pulling on me now. Something\nfrom somewhere else and its yanking me away to-\nI\u2019m\nriding. My horse\u2019s sharp hooves are digging shallow graves in the\nmoist earth. There\nis thunder. There\nis light. There is a roar and\u2026I am floating. I cannot seem to move or swim.\nI look down at my hands and they aren\u2019t there. There is no colour. There\nis no white or black. Still\nI see everything. I\u2019m\ninside of something. I\nknow that now. I\u2019m\ninside of something and I\u2019ve been here before.\nI\nthink my name is Peter. Someone\u2019s\nname is Peter.\nI\u2019m\non my horse again.

My body is only aware of itself through pure sensation.\nHere I know more than ever before.\nI know that there has been a before.\nThat I\u2019ve been here several times like a reoccurring\nnightmare. Only\nit\u2019s not a nightmare. I\nremember riding the same distance time and time again.\nI remember the flash of light vanishing in a clap of\nthunder just as it reappeared from behind.\nThere\nis heat and cold. Ice\nand fire. Peter.\nI know the name Peter. Thunder. Light. Thunder.\nI\nstop my horse this time and look back to see light crest the\nrear horizon.

She took out her embroidered handkerchief, and dabbed at a trickle of sweat that rolled off her temple. A tight whalebone corset, a layer of undergarments, and her best wool dress made the early June warmth quite unbearable.\nThe corset was giving her a bit more pain than usual, because she'd forgone her morning pip, wanting to be at her sharpest on this most important of days. She gave her parasol a quick glance, wondering if she would be able to use it today.\nThe one-room schoolhouse was empty. The only school in Rava, the chief village in East Nissouri, had until quite recently been filled with children in a state of great excitement. Not only was the school-year over, but the Afrikaner Army was going to pass through Rava on its way to fight the last British holdouts on the Bruce Peninsula. To many, the march through town would signify the final defeat of the Empire, and to Minnie, she might have once described it as a day of liberation -- not that she would ever share that sentiment with anyone she knew.\nNone would want to miss the Afrikaners, and their new terror-weapons. The boys in Minnie's class talked endlessly of the automatic repeaters, the moving fortresses, the flying machines, though they never mentioned the dread Afrikaner persecution squads. They had an unhealthy fascination with the modern weapons and tactics of the Boers that thankfully, the girls didn't share.\nMinnie went to her desk, and collected her notes for the completed history lesson: After the defeat of the British in South Africa, the Boers had consolidated their grip on first that country, and eventually all of the continent, including the Suez Canal. It marked the beginning of the end for the British Empire, for without a reliable passage to the wealth of India, its economy suffered. Under their ruthless tutelage, the wealth of Africa made the Boers a world power to rival Britain, Russia, and even the growing strength of America. There were rumors of horrific deeds in the Dark Continent, though neither innuendo, nor the British Army, had been able to stop the Boer onslaught.\nThey invaded and captured India, Australia, New Zealand, and now it looked as though Canada would be the last Dominion to fall, leaving only the island fortress of Britain unconquered. The Boers claimed to have no other territorial ambitions, but Minnie knew better. She knew the Krijgvader, the Afrikaner supreme commander, and she hoped to see him leading his victorious troops that very day . . .. . . Nurse Minnie Chesterton tried to pin the man down on the camp cot, but he was too powerful for her, more horse than human. He was raving. A lunatic. For a few brief moments, Minnie thought that she might be falling in love with him. The man she was trying to restrain was Karl de Miggen, a prisoner in the East Nissouri Concentration Camp, where the British Empire sequestered about 50,000 Boer men from the Transvaal, nearly 100 times the population of East Nissouri itself.\nAt first, her flirtation with the charismatic man had seemed harmless enough. While she spent most of her days in the camp infirmary, she had noticed him watching her from beyond the barbed wire that separated the infirmary from the rest of the camp. He was a tall, striking man, with piercing black eyes and a shock of blond hair. One day, she approached him and said, \"you sir, are a rogue. You have been quite brazenly watching me.\"\n\"And why shouldn't I? You are the best thing to look at around here. Besides, the men tell me that you seem to care for our health.\"\n\"It is my job, sir. The Christian thing to do, is to succor the infirm. The weak.\"\n\"If it's the Christian thing, then I'm not sure I approve of your motives. Perhaps it might be better to let the weak die. No, I think you do it out of guilt. You see how we are forced to live here. But do you let your countrymen know?\"\n\"No! The authorities would not take kindly to it. Besides,\" Minnie stopped herself. She didn't have to explain herself to this man.\nA sergeant came over, his chest pushed out: \"can I help you Sister?\"\n\"No, sergeant. This prisoner here felt that he had the right to talk with me. Clearly, he was wrong.\"\n\"You're best not talk with the likes of them at all Sister, they're little better than animals.\" With that the British soldier indicated that she should return to the infirmary, and the Boer gave Minnie an ironic smile. \"You see, Sister,\" he emphasized the word, \"you are at their beck and call as much as we.\"\n\"Shut up you 'friker maggot!\" shouted the sergeant, \"or I'll give you one.\"\nBut as the days turned into seasons, the prisoner was always there, waiting to talk with her when she could. No matter the weather. He was there. And something drew her to him. She discovered that he was brilliant. A politician, an inventor, a scientist . . . a visionary. But it took some time to discover the breadth of that vision . . .\n. . . Minnie collected her parasol, and left the building. She hoped to return later, though if she didn't - well, it would be worth it.\nShe made her way down to the main street, about a mile's walk, which didn't cool her down any. The parasol might have helped a little, but she preferred to leave it unopened. There was quite a crowd gathered at the town square, where an impromptu party had broken out - the Reeve of East Nissouri was there, welcoming the conquerors. No doubt, he would have welcomed the British with a more formal ceremony, had their former masters won the war. He and the well-to-do of Rava were sipping lemonade with several Boer generals and the Krijgvader, while the troops marched past and the hoi-polloi watched excitedly.\nHeads turned as Minnie approached. Even without the sadistic ministrations of the corset, she had a fabulously thin waist and an amble bosom that all the women in the village envied. With the corset, she was spectacular. The dress had a stiff, tall collar, and it covered her ankles properly, so there was nothing for which the ladies of the village could chastise her.\n\"Ah,\" said the Reeve. He was a detestable, corpulent man by the name of Quentin Fargman, of the London Fargmans. The former British lick-spittle turned to his new masters, and said: \"this is Miss Minnie Chesterton, the mistress of our school.\" He emphasized the word mistress in a most despicable manner.\nThe Boers nodded their heads to her, but the Krijgvader of the new Afrikaner Empire, looked at Minnie strangely.\n\"Have we met, Miss Chesterton?\"\n\"Oh, I would certainly remember if we had, sir. Does one call you sir?\"\n\"My men call me sir. You must call me Karl. I am surprised that we have not met, for you look most familiar. Perhaps in another time, we knew one another. Or perhaps your beauty simply reminds of Venus.\"\n\"Perhaps in --\" Minnie started to respond, and was stopped by a tremendous rumble. The moving fortresses had arrived! The mighty machines were made of iron and steel plating, angled so that shells would ricochet off them. Inside each machine there was a crew of men to work the engine that propelled the device and the terrible automatic repeating cannon. Similar to the Gatling gun, the repeating cannon fired 30 calibre shells at a shocking rate; the technology had sealed the Boer victory in India.\nTara's citizens watched as their new masters demonstrated this palpable force, as did the Generals, still enamored of their cunning weapons. But the Krijgvader watched the exquisite face of Minnie Chesterton, and tried to remember where he had seen her before. . .\n. . . It was easy for her to get the man into the infirmary. She gave him small doses of narcotics and purgatives, enough of both to make it seem as though he had cholera, a common enough occurrence in the camp, which was becoming a place of death and disease. The doctor was too busy to take note of every patient, so she sequestered him in a private corner of the infirmary.\nShe loved talking with him. He had the most interesting mind. And body. She tried to suppress that thought, but was largely unsuccessful as they talked between kisses.\n\"Tell me again how you were captured.\"\n\"Ah. No. It is a bitter story, woman. I'll tell you what I plan to do when I escape, though.\"\n\"What, Karl? Tell me you don't want to escape from me.\"\n\"No. But this place. Our destiny. I know that if I could lead the Boers, I could win. I have ideas for new war machines, machines that would win us the war.\"\n\"And then what? Farming?\" Minnie sniggered at the thought of the restless man settling down on a farm, like the men of East Nissouri. Not that she did not think farming was admirable, important even, but she craved adventure.\n\"No, no, I have other plans. . .\" and he made it abundantly clear that some of them included her. As he pulled her down to the camp cot, Minnie doubted quite sincerely that the Sisters of Mercy would approve of the Boer's intentions . . .\n. . . When the last of the moving fortresses left the square, clanking over the bridge on the Medway, it was possible for conversation to resume. De Miggen turned to chat with Minnie, and was surprised to see that she was gone, talking with two elderly gentlemen.\nMinnie noticed him, and smiled. A trickle of sweat ran down her temple again, as she was intensely aware of his scrutiny. He was walking towards her!\nIt was then that the flying machines droned overhead. They were huge armored dirigibles that carried bombs, guns, and specially trained troops who could drop behind enemy lines on long ropes. Everyone, except for the Krijgvader looked up to watch them pass. . .\n. . . They were in a flight of passion. He was raving. A lunatic. For a few brief moments, Minnie thought that she might be falling in love with him. Then he revealed to her the germ of his ideas. He hated. He hated all the races that were not Boer.\nHe gasped his evil truth and the fire turned to ice within her: \"The earth is meant for the Boer race, and none other. At first we will probably let some of the less inferior white races survived, but eventually, they will all be - \" he paused at the height of his fervor, and then groaned. \"Exterminated.\"\nAs he fell asleep, Minnie lay there, horrified and so very cold . . .\n. . . He walked towards her, the crowd looking upward, with recognition dawning in his eyes. Minnie knew that she only had a moment to decide if she would go through with it. She was surrounded by her fellow East Nissourians and entire army of Afrikaners, but she knew what she had to do . . .\n. . . the nurse knew what she had to do, and really, it was so easy. It was unlikely that Karl de Miggen, prisoner at the East Nissouri concentration camp, would escape, but she was not going to take that chance. She returned later that evening.\n\"Karl,\" she whispered. \"No, don't wake up. I have to give you another shot, because the doctor insists on checking you.\"\n\"Oh, must you?\"\n\"Yes, Karl. It's best. It won't hurt, I promise.\" She took out the needle, and swabbed his arm with alcohol.\nIt's tip was in his vein, her thumb poised on the plunger; he looked at her, his intense eyes, black, she now knew, with passion, yes, but evil too. And in that moment, as she looked back with pity and revulsion, he understood, what she was about to do . . .\n. . . Minnie watched as full recognition dawned on the face of the Krijgveder, Karl de Miggen. He walked towards her and opened the flap on his holster. This time would be different! The triumph in his eyes said.\nMinnie smiled sadly, and drew her parasol up so that it was pointing at his heart. His laugh was cut short by the crack of a gunshot. . .\n. . . The plunger went down, and enough drug entered the prisoner's system to send him into a sleep from which he would never awaken. Never would he slaughter millions for the colour of their skin . . .\n. . . Minnie screamed theatrically, while a blossom of crimson appeared on the torso of the Krijgveder's uniform. He toppled, a look of shock on his face, the unvoiced words, \"not again,\" still on his lips.\nMinnie brought the tip of the parasol down to hide the smoke coming from its end. No one had seen the shot. No one ever guessed that in another time and place, it was not only common, but quite proper for a young lady to have a rifled gun hidden in the stem of her parasol.\nMinnie Chesterton walked back to her school, hoping that one day, there would be a history worth teaching.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20051003193024\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/janmar2002\/afrikaners.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The Internet's Premier Magazine of Historical Science Fiction","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/-J8cpBDOFSO+sBvBOefuiX3afP0.json","volume":3.0,"issues":1.0,"has_text":true}

Long reaches of shadow lie between the sputtering streetlamps which\nprovide the only sounds. Ordinary folk do not frequent these places, fearing cutpurses and worse; but the criminal element do not frequent these alleys, since their victims are not about.\nSome places are impossible to find except when one is lost. Indeed, who has not occasionally stumbled across a little cafe or gallery or shop, and then been\nunable subsequently to locate it again? The superstitious might grant that\nthere was something fey or supernatural about these places, that apparently come and go of their own accord. In a day or a week, the traveler returns to what he is sure is the same spot, only to find unfamiliar surroundings and unhelpful passers-by.\nIt was on just such an evening, in the summer of '21, a gentleman attired in black found himself lost in such a cobbled maze. He had gone out on an\nevening walk, leaving the confines of his hotel room to taste the night air.\nBeing of a mathematical bent, he had his mind fixed upon a problem, and he was not sensible of his surroundings, nor did he keep good account of the turnings\nhe took in his travels. Nearly two hours had gone when he stopped suddenly in the middle of a narrow street, blinking as though awakened from slumber. He\nknew suddenly that he was in an utterly unfamiliar quarter of the city, with no idea of how he had gotten there or how to find his way back.\nHe turned to look back at the street from off he had turned only moments before. Every shop window was dark, and in fact, he could not recall when he\nhad last seen a lighted window or another living soul upon the street. He turned forward therefore and perceived a dim light beyond the next streetlamp,\nsurely from one of the shops on that cramped nameless street. He thanked fortune that it must be inhabited by another nocturnal creature such as himself. Striding then resolutely forward, he soon stood before the source of\nthe light, a narrow little shop with many-paned windows bearing a thin coating of dust. The sign above the door was weathered and faded. It read:\nA.\nThomasson\nPurveyor of Antiquities\nand Oddities\nIt was a wonder that he had seen the shop at all, for the light which now\nspilled out onto the paving was very dim indeed; but, squinting through the pane of the door, he could see that the shop was occupied, for he could see a\nman sitting at a long, low desk with his account books spread before him.\nWith some hesitation, he tried the door, found it unlocked, and opened it, stepping inside. He removed his hat, inclined his head, and with an apologetic\nsmile, said, 'Good sir, forgive me, but might I intrude upon your time?'\nWith that, the proprietor looked up for the first time and returned the smile.\nHis light brown hair was tinged very slightly with grey, and his bespectacled\neyes betrayed intelligence and warmth. When he stood to return the greeting,\nhis stature was not great; but he seemed to possess a dignity beyond that of\nthe usual shopkeeper. 'I suppose,' he said, 'that you have gone on an evening walk and have gotten lost.'\nThe gentleman in black laughed shortly and admitted that it was so. He was about to inquire as to the way back when the shopkeeper spoke again. 'Please do\nstay awhile,' he said. 'I do not get many visitors once the lamps are lit, and\nas for myself, I frequently burn the mid-night oil quite literally. I would be\nglad of your company.'\nThe gentleman in black was of a mind to leave, but he felt an impulse to respond to the offer of conversation; so he murmured his introduction and shook\nhands with the proprietor.\n'Please let me show you around my treasure-house. There is something here to\ninterest everyone, and I do not doubt that you will find some bauble or artifact to interest you as well.' Saying this, the proprietor reached over and\nturned up the desk-lamp, so that the illumination was trebled.\nThe gentleman in black perceived then that the ceiling was higher than he had\nbelieved, higher than that of the typical shop; indeed, it must have extended\npartway into the second storey, perhaps with an attic-space above. The walls,\nmoreover, were lined with shelves to a height far greater than a man's reach,\nand the upper shelves, almost at the ceiling, were accessible only by the\nladders which ran back and forth on rails. These shelves were piled with an amazingly diverse assemblage of items. There were loose papers, books, and\nmanuscripts, in no discernible order; there were boxes and small crates which\nlooked as though they strained the shelving with their weight; and there was\nthe hint of not-quite-recognizable objects in the still-dim light, objects ranging from ornate figurines in ceramic and pewter to small musical\ninstruments and even mechanical contrivances.\nThe middle area of the store was divided into two aisles, though it was barely\nwide enough for it; there were more items piled in the middle, including boxes,\ntrunks, tables filled to overflowing, and unidentifiable man-sized things which loomed in the shadows. Though the shop was narrow, surely no more than\nfifteen feet across, it seemed to go back forever; in fact, surely the back of\nthe shop must adjoin another street, so that it had twice the depth of its neighbors.\nThe proprietor leaned forward a little to examine his companion. 'I perceive,'\nhe said, 'that you are a professor by occupation.'\nThe other man blinked and was taken aback, experiencing the same sensation one\nhas when a mentalist or a charlatan of a fortune-teller makes a lucky surmise.\n'I am indeed,' he said, and laughed. 'But if one can tell merely by looking at\nme, I should speak with my tailor.'\nBut the proprietor only smiled in return, saying, 'I make it my business to know such things.' He turned and retrieved a taper from a desk drawer, then\nlit it from the desk lamp. He began picking up odds and ends from the vast array around them, holding each one as if he were intimately familiar with it,\nand telling its meaning and history with no benefit of a label or catalogue.\nIn truth, the professor was not much inclined to this sort of thing, although\none or two of the items had caught his eye. The proprietor was showing him a\nsmall worn sculpture, perhaps of bronze. 'It is several centuries old,' he was\nsaying, 'a copy of a much older Roman piece, but it is the work of a minor artisan.'\nThe professor's attention was beginning to wander when the other man suddenly\nstopped and smiled. 'But this is not what you came here to find,' he said.\n'This is an interesting and varied assortment of merchandise,' said the professor, returning to himself. 'But, of course,' he said, 'I came here by\naccident, and didn't come here to find anything at all.'\n'What is accident,' said the shorter man, 'and what is design? Everyone, I assure you, comes here looking for something. Come with me.'\nThe other man followed the proprietor, obedient but perplexed; and presently\nthey stood before the ladder that ran the length of the right-hand side of the\nstore. 'Here, will you hold this?' said the shopkeeper, handing over the candle, which the professor gingerly took. 'Higher, so that I can see.'\nWhen he came back down the ladder, he held in his hands a plain wooden box of\nindeterminate age. It was well over a foot in width, not quite so big front-to-back, and with a depth of only a few inches. 'Here,' he said, 'Over to the\ndesk. Empty that chair and sit down.'\nThe professor did so with a growing sense of wonder, for we all from childhood\nhave a fascination with closed boxes. What might this one contain?\nThe shopkeeper took the candle and snuffed it out, then turned without ceremony\nto the box and raised the hinged lid. Inside was a package wrapped in paper,\nand the wrappings had yellowed with the passage of time. He carefully removed\nthe package and placed it on the surface of the desk, undoing the bundle to reveal even more ancient discolored paper within, paper that seemed to be\ncovered in writing.\nThe professor leaned over it, curious in spite of himself. 'I had thought this\nto be vellum,' he said. 'But it is clearly parchment. And the writing, the odd\nwriting, that is Arabic or some such.'\n'No,' said the shopkeeper. 'It is Italian.'\n'Italian? But surely -- I mean to say, I cannot even discern the letters. Such\na scrawl --'\nAt this point the professor stopped as if struck dumb. He delicately picked up\na single page from the stack of papers and held it in front of him. He turned\nit away from him, staring at the back, and held it between himself and the flame of the desk lamp.\nHe was lost in wonderment, for the moment speechless. 'This is written backward, right to left,' he said at length. 'I am not a man of great artistic\nknowledge, but -- may I ask the age of this manuscript?'\n'The exact age is uncertain,' said the proprietor. 'It is approximately three\nhundred twenty years, and certainly no more than three hundred thirty.'\nThe professor had already gone on to examine later pages. 'There is mathematics\nhere,' he said hoarsely. 'I recognize much of the notation, though some of it\nis cryptic to me. And this' -- here he indicated a set of neatly labeled drawings -- 'this is a Cartesian graph, or I am the King. But it is a Cartesian\ngraph that is older than Descartes.' His companion said nothing in return.\nMinutes passed as he sat literally on the edge of his seat. He turned the pages\nover slowly and deliberately as if they were made of priceless gold leaf. 'This\nis astounding,' he said at last. 'It is simply astounding. Before Newton, before Leibniz -- how many discoveries must he have made?'\nHe looked up at the proprietor, his eyes begging for the truth. 'Is it genuine?' he asked. 'Is this manuscript the work of Leonardo da Vinci?'\n'It is,' his companion answered. 'And I mean it to be yours. You will take it with you.'\nThe professor's jaw nearly dropped. 'I could not,' he said. 'In the first place, I could never afford --'\n'You need not buy it,' the shopkeeper said. 'It is a gift.' As the other man\nopened his mouth to protest, he made a dismissive gesture and said, 'I will have it no other way.'\nThe manuscript had reclaimed the professor's attention. 'There is more here,'\nhe said. 'This man was renowned for his mechanical skills. It is no wonder that\nhis drawings of gears are so precise. And yet, if this manuscript is of a single piece--'\nHe was lost in the pages, talking to himself. 'One would have to machine these\nparts to a tolerance of less than the thousandth part of an inch. And -- what\nin heaven does this have to do with the calculus?' he asked, staring at the yellowed parchment. When understanding came to him, his hands began to shake\nwith excitement. 'No,' he said. 'I have dared to dream of such things only recently, but -- no, it cannot be.' He stared wild-eyed across the desk at the\nproprietor.\n'It can be, and it is,' said the shopkeeper. 'Now take it with you. It is past\nmid-night now.'\nThe professor did not argue. He stood, gathered up the pages, reassembled the\npackage, and returned it to the box. He clutched it to his chest, wide-eyed as\nif in a daze, and moved toward the door. He paused and turned around. 'I trust, Mr. Thomasson,' he said, 'that I will be able to find my way back? That\nI shall not need your directions?'\n'No,' said the shopkeeper. 'You will not.'\n'And I trust,' he said slowly, 'that I shall have great difficulty finding this\nshop again, or even this street?'\nThe shopkeeper smiled and spread his hands in a gesture of futility. 'Most people,' he said, 'find what they need here and do not come back.'\n'Then I thank you, sir. Thank you, and good evening.' Without another word, the\nprofessor eased through the front door and walked off into the dimly lit alley.\nThe shopkeeper stood at the door. 'Good evening to you, too, Mr. Babbage,' he\nsaid. 'Good evening to you.'","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050421124105\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/aprjun2001\/ahead.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The Internet's Premier Magazine of Historical Science Fiction","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/M0PXGG+OulsblDv2A842laERV5A.json","volume":2.0,"issues":2.0,"has_text":true}

You can hardly surprise\nus with your ways.\"\nJigger dunked his only luminescent finger into the tea offered\nby Mrs. Rosenbaum to sample its flavor. An aromatic rush\nof oranges and spices he could not name filled his mouth\nuntil it began to water. He swallowed quickly so as not\nto make a mess of himself, but even so Mrs. Rosenbaum thoughtfully\nwrapped a monogrammed and lace-trimmed napkin around his\ngreen stalk of a neck.\nJigger dipped his head. \"Thank you,\" he said and\nswirled his finger around the tea.\nThe motion released more spice into his system. Jigger closed\nhis perfectly round and sapphire eyes. The tea was more\npungent than any Mrs. Rosenbaum had served before and he\nfelt shaky. As his eyes rolled open, Jigger withdrew his\nfinger and wiped it on the napkin around his neck.\nMrs. Rosenbaum dumped a spoonful of sugar into her tea and\nstirred it fast enough to send droplets flying. Her ample\nbody took up almost half of the settee. Mrs. Rosenbaum was\none of the largest humans Jigger had seen during his time\non Earth.\nBeing that he was the only alien she had seen and she didn't\ngape at his size--a height close to her ceiling and a width\nto match her ironing board--he refused to gape at hers.\nIn all their time together, Mrs. Rosenbaum hadn't commented\non his scaled green skin or the various jewel-colored olfactory\nglands which began between his eyes and dotted his forehead.\n\"This Mr. Melmoth,\" Jigger said. \"Tell me\nabout him.\"\nThe conversation only served to draw out the moment they\nboth felt approaching, but Jigger was reluctant to bring\nmatters to a close. He would miss Mrs. Rosenbaum's tea parties.\nThe ladies who sat primly in velvet chairs before the settee\ngiggled. Jigger looked at Pamela, Merriwether, and Mary,\nand could find nothing that merited laughter. A fourth chair,\ncovered in pistachio-colored velvet, sat empty beside Mary,\nand if anything, Jigger believed Mary should have been dabbing\nat tear-filled eyes over the recent loss of the chair's\noccupant.\nHe looked back to Mrs. Rosenbaum. Her mouth drew into a\nfirm line and she shot Mary a black glance which silenced\nher laughter. According to Mrs. Rosenbaum, Pearl was visiting\nrelatives, but they all knew different. There had been no\none in Jigger's stomach cavity for Pearl to visit.\n\"Melmoth was scandalous,\" Pamela offered when\nMrs. Rosenbaum said nothing. She was pinned with an equally\nblack look that caused her to bend her head and study her\nteacup.\nMrs. Rosenbaum's eyes came to Jigger. \"His ways may\nhave caused scandal,\" she said carefully, \"but\nthey were no more strange than your own. Perhaps he was\nahead of his time, as you are.\"\nJigger shifted on his small portion of settee, legs crossed\nbut feet still managing to touch the low table that rested\nbetween them and held tea, cakes, and crackers. His knees,\nclad in what Mrs. Rosenbaum assured him were the most fashionable\nof trousers, rose before him like thin mountain peaks, over\nwhich he caught Mary's disapproving stare.\n\"He was a writer,\" Mrs. Rosenbaum continued, \"and\nI have a good many of his books. Admired, until the end.\"\nHer eyes narrowed and she emptied her teacup. \"I am\nsorry you have come to similar ends, Jigger.\"\nMary set her cup down with a rattle. \"They share a\ntaste for depravity, is that it?\" She clutched a hand\nto the frilled collar of her blouse, thumb stroking the\nedge of her cameo.\n\"I have never tasted depravity,\" Jigger said.\nHe looked to Mrs. Rosenbaum who shook her head in confirmation.\n\"Is it sweet?\"\nMary stood from her chair so quickly that her knee caught\nthe edge of a plate. The plate tipped for a moment and the\nrich chocolate cake slid to the tabletop.\n\"I will not stay here!\" Mary cried. She flung\nher napkin toward Mrs. Rosenbaum and fled the room. The\nnapkin, fairly weightless, floated for a moment before it\nsettled to cover the cake.\nJigger looked after Mary, in time to see the kitchen door\nslam. When he looked back to Mrs. Rosenbaum it was to find\nher lifting the napkin and righting the cake.\n\"My people will not be long,\" Jigger said and\ngave Pamela and Merriwether what he hoped was an apologetic\nlook. They seem resigned to their fate, but Jigger hoped\nhe wouldn't have to bring them to it. \"I will go soon\nand--\"\n\"Jigger, do not trouble yourself.\" Mrs. Rosenbaum\nreached for his hand, never hesitating as she patted and\ncooed. Her eyes were nothing but kind and Jigger told himself\nagain that she would be the last. He would eat her last\nand only out of the most grave necessity. He hoped beyond\nall hope that his people would come for him before there\nwas such need.\n\"You'll be doing us all a favor,\" Merriwether\nsaid. She dragged her finger through the frosting on the\ntable and licked it clean. \"By eating Mary, I mean.\"\nMary would be tough and bitter, of that Jigger was certain.\n\"I despise the government,\" Pamela murmured and\ncrossed her arms over her small chest. \"It's all fine\nand good when you're a novelty, isn't it, but then they\ndiscover you have ...odd needs... and--and--\" Pamela\nburied her face in her hands, but it didn't smother the\nsound of her sobs.\n\"Men always have odd needs.\" Mrs. Rosenbaum smiled\nand nudged Jigger. There was a time when she hadn't been\ncertain he was the male of his species, but now she knows\nall there is to know about him. This saddened Jigger and\nmade him more resolute about getting off this planet before\nit came time to eat Mrs. Rosenbaum.\n\"I've told you about my husband--such an odd bird.\"\nShe laughed, coughed, and took up a thin slice of the chocolate\ncake. \"Couldn't stand chocolate, or sunshine, or lemonade.\nWhat kind of a man was he? Cake?\"\nJigger shook his head. He could not eat the cake; she knew\nthis, but continually offered.\nMrs. Rosenbaum's cough deepened. He poured more tea for\nher and added a dollop of honey. She clicked her tongue\nat him.\n\"Jigger, I don't like honey.\"\n\"Your throat will find it soothing.\" He held the\ncup to her lips and gave her no choice but to drink. He\nused to think coming to this planet was the biggest mistake\nof his young life, but his life was enriched by knowing\nMrs. Rosenbaum. His family will be angry with him when he\nreturns home, but he cannot stay here. The government officials\nhave made that clear.\n\"Tonight, I think,\" Mrs. Rosenbaum said softly.\nIf Jigger's ears weren't the size of dinner plates, he wouldn't\nhave heard her. \"Tonight.\"\nJigger shook his head. \"No. They will come. They will.\"\nHis resolve was so firm that the teacup broke under it.\nTea and fine china cascaded down Mrs. Rosenbaum's dress,\nsoaking her with honey and spiced oranges. She laughed.\n\"Men!\" She wriggled to her feet and then into\nthe kitchen to tend herself.\nAlone with Pamela and Merriwether, Jigger stared at his\nhands. He couldn't bring himself to look at the women.\n\"It would be a blessing,\" Pamela said eventually.\nJigger looked up at her, so earnest in her blue dress with\nits wide lace collar. Her life was one of comfort and tea\nparties. Pamela believed in the heavens and their bounty\nand those beliefs brought her to this house, confined with\nan alien. They had given their lives so that he might live.\nJigger hated himself. His first contact with aliens was\nnot supposed to be this complicated. They were not supposed\nto be delicious.\n\"Mrs. Rosenbaum will not get better,\" Merriwether\nadded. \"She has had that cough for years now, and you\nsee how her eyes begin to sink, the rest of her to sag.\nShe wants you to--\"\n\"Do not speak those words.\" Jigger lifted his\nhand, luminescent finger pointed toward the ceiling. \"Do\nnot.\" Hunger clawed at his stomach; Pearl was a small\ngirl, it had taken only a week to consume the nutrients\nshe had to offer. If Mrs. Rosenbaum took longer, might these\nother women be spared?\n\"What did your Mr. Melmoth do when confronted with\ntemptation?\" Jigger asked.\nTemptation sat before Jigger now, legs crossed, hands upon\nknees. He couldn't see the slim ankles, but it was the wrists\nthat captivated him. How sweet to break the hand and suckle\nfrom the stem. He wished he'd never learned such a thing.\nJigger stuck his finger into the tea and focused on the\nterrible rush of orange and spice so that he might not lunge\nand take them both.\n\"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield\nto it,\" Pamela said.\n\"This is not comforting news.\" Jigger buried his\nface in his hands, wondering if salvation might be found\nthere. There was only the churning hunger within him. When\nhe looked at Pamela and Merriwether again, they both smiled\npleasantly.\n\"There is no telling when your people will come for\nyou,\" Merriwether said.\n\"Then I must yield,\" Jigger said. He rose from\nthe settee and followed the path Mrs. Rosenbaum had taken\nmoments before. He felt cool droplets of fragrant tea beneath\nhis bare feet as he walked. A sticky spot of honey.\nJigger stepped into the kitchens and took hold of disagreeable\nMary by her wrist.\nTHE END","source":"http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20051030132526\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/mrmelmoth.htm","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/Pth7sv59uqxrMsX1Jm+1ZljpzVo.json","volume":4.0,"issues":3.0,"has_text":true}

He\ntried to smile, but he was still shaking too badly.tried to smile, but he was still shaking too badly.\nThe\nrebel charge ran out of steam and the survivors backed down the hill, firing\na few shots in retreat. Chamberlain's men took a few deep breaths and patiently\nprepared for the next assault.\n\"Mr.\nYeliab, will you please read aloud to the rest of the class? I've placed the\ntext onto your viewing screen.\"\nYeliab\nlooked up, startled. \"Read aloud, Sir?\" This was almost never done in\nDunderclop's class.\n\"Yes,\nthat's what I said. Please read aloud.\"\nYeliab\nglanced down at his screen. The other eight students in the class looked\nat him expectantly. He scratched one of his appendages, cleared his throat, and\nbegan to read in a soft, hesitant voice:\nDunderclop\nperched on the front of his desk like a range cat. \"Now class,\nwho can tell me what's wrong with that passage?\" he asked.who can tell me what's wrong with that passage?\" he asked.\nNo\none spoke, especially not Yeliab, who had been working on this world\nall semester. He didn't want to hear about any problems now, six weeks before final exams.all semester. He didn't want to hear about any problems now, six weeks before final exams.\n\"Well,\nsince no one else seems to be able to see it, I'll ask Mr. Yeliab. Mr.\nYeliab, do you recognize what you just read?\"Yeliab, do you recognize what you just read?\"\n\"Of\ncourse, Sir. It's from the world I'm working on. That passage was from a history\nof a war they had.\"\n\"And\nthat history is accurate?\"\n\"As\naccurate as most histories, I guess.\"\n\"And\nyou expect us to believe it?\"\n\"Believe\nwhat, Sir?\"\n\"That\npart about the canteen. And the bayonet charge.\"\nYeliab\nfelt an uncomfortable rumbling in one of his stomachs. He didn't like the\nway this was going. \"But Sir, I can vouch for that one. I watched the whole\nbattle as it happened.\"\n\"Nonsense.\nYou wanted the north to win the war, so you decided to do a little\ntampering.\"\n\"What?\nWhy would I do that? I didn't tamper with anything.\"\n\"You\ndon't expect me to believe that a canteen hanging in precisely the right place\ncould change the outcome of a whole war, do you?\"\n\"But\nSir, that's the way it came out.\"\n\"Mr.\nYeliab, you are a fine student, one of the brightest I've had in a long time,\nbut let's face facts. If, in the unlikely event that someone's life was saved by\na canteen, he certainly would not have had the frizzlebutt to then order a\nbayonet charge against a fully-armed attacking force. We're not talking about\none of the Gods here. We're talking about a man. It's simply preposterous.\nChange it.\"\nNow\nYeliab felt a rumbling in all of his stomachs. \"Change it?\"\n\"Yes.\nChange it. Go back and fix the problem.\"\n\"But\nSir, the world is already 150 years ahead of that point.\" Yeliab shuddered.\nTo go back that far was a nightmare. World-building was like a very complicated\ngame of fall-blocks; you set up a playing surface, programmed in a pattern, and\nthen watched the blocks spread out in all different directions. You couldn't\njust blindly take out a whole section and expect a new pattern to develop in\nharmony with the rest of the blocks. You would probably cause the rest of the\nblocks to fall down, all the way back to the beginning. The only way to change\nanything was to carefully remove each block, one painstaking step at a time,\nuntil you got back to the point you wanted to change.\n\"I\nrealize it won't be easy,\" said Dunderclop. \"No one ever said this\nclass would\nbe easy, but you will not get a passing grade from me unless you fix the\nproblem.\"\nYeliab\nwas near panic. His education had been going so nicely until now, and\nhe was almost finished. How could this happen, especially when he hadn't done\nanything wrong?\n\"Sir,\nI saw that battle happen. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain was a genuine hero\nthat day - a remarkable fellow.\"\n\"If\nhe was really that remarkable, he would have become an emperor. I notice\nthat that didn't happen.\"\n\"But\nSir, that's what's so remarkable. He was just an ordinary fellow thrust into\nan extraordinary circumstance. My world is full of people like that - that's why\nI like it so much.\"\nDunderclop\nwas clearly not convinced. \"If your world is full of people like that,\nI guess I should have looked at it a little closer. Maybe the whole thing is a\nfraud. Maybe you have been tampering with it all along.\"\nYeliab\nfelt himself getting in deeper but he couldn't stop. The ideas were zinging\naround in his head like nortrons. \"I've been thinking quite a bit about\nthis, Sir, and I think our own civilization is a lot like my world. Our history\nis full of ordinaries who became great. Events make heroes. Where would\nTrestermain have been if his parents hadn't been killed in a freak, space crash\nwhen he was young?\nHe\nwould probably have gone into the family business and become a clerk. How would\nhe have learned to be a world-builder then?\"\nDunderclop's\neyes flashed bright yellow. \"That's nonsense and you know it, Mr.\nYeliab. Trestermain was a genius, one of history's great figures. It doesn't\nmatter what happened when he was a child.\"\nYeliab\nvisibly shrunk under his professor's onslaught. He should have known\nbetter than to have brought up the name of Dunderclop's greatest idol. He felt\nhis hopes slipping away. \"That's precisely my point, Sir. Trestermain\nstarted out as an ordinary, but events gave him the opportunity to show what\nhe...\"\n\"Diddlycock!\nI've studied Trestermain all my life, and if he was ever an ordinary,\nthen I'm Bazzelfreep. I don't need to stand here on my three legs and listen to\na University student slander a great artist.\"\n\"I'm\nsorry, Sir, I meant no disrespect. It's just that when we examine history, we\nrealize how much of an impact one individual can have on events.\"\n\"Thank\nyou for your input, Mr. Yeliab. Now I suggest you take some of that misplaced\nenthusiasm and use it to correct the fanciful tampering you've done. Up to this\npoint your world has been excellent. Don't ruin it with something\nridiculous.\"\n\"But,\nSir...\"\n\"Good\nday, Mr. Yeliab.\"\nChamberlain\nwiped the sweat from his forehead, just as a piercing pain clutched\nat his stomach. 'Oh no,' he thought. 'Not here. Not right now.' But the pain\nwouldn't let up. Stomach cramps. They had been plaguing him for the last few\ndays, but this was a really bad time for them to show up again.\nChamberlain\ngave a few cursory orders to his men and moved towards the rear\nto look for a bush. As he left the field, he had a nagging feeling that\nsomething monumental was going to happen soon. He would have to hurry back.\n\"Go\nahead, Mr. Yeliab. The rest of the class will find this very interesting.\"\nYeliab\nhated this. He really hated this. He cleared his throat and began to read:\n\"Double\ndiddlycock.\"\n\"But\nSir...\"\n\"Don't\n'but Sir' me, Yeliab. That was very unscholarly. First you have Chamberlain\nsaved by a canteen, and now you have him moving his bowels so he's not on the\nbattlefield when the bullet in question flies towards his waiting flesh.\nWhat\nis it with you and this fellow? Don't you know that forming an emotional\nattachment to one of your subjects violates the Ninth Commandment Of\nWorld-Building?\"\nYeliab\nlooked down at the floor. \"I had to do something for the guy. When you\nmade me take away that canteen, he would have died.\"\n\"So\nyou sent him into the bushes to move his bowels.\"\n\"It\nwas all I could think of, Sir.\"\n\"And\nthen he became a hero again anyhow, two days later.\"\n\"I\nsuppose so, Sir. He really is a remarkable fellow.\"\nDunderclop\nsat on the edge of his desk and took off his specs. He assumed his\n'kindly professor' pose, the pose that most of his students never saw.\n\"Look\nhere, Yeliab, I once made a mistake very much like yours. It was in my\nlast year at University. I built a beautiful world, maybe my best ever. I can\nstill smell the green grass after all of these years. I watched my project grow\nand prosper and I was very proud of myself for creating it. Late\nin the semester a particular woman was born in that world, a princess. She\nwas destined to become a queen, and, given her obvious talents, most probably an\nEmpress. She was beautiful and charming, one of the finest specimens my world\nhad produced. I became very fond of her, just watching her through the viewer\nevery night as I lay in bed. Then she fell off of her horse on the way to the\npalace and died. Just like that. I think you know what I did then. I decided to do a little tampering.\"palace and died. Just like that. I think you know what I did then. I decided to do a little tampering.\"\n\"But\nSir, I didn't...\"\n\"Let\nme finish. I don't usually confess this to my students, so you ought to\nlisten closely. I went back and fixed things so her horse died the day before. It was a simple thing, really, just a stray lightning bolt. Guess what happened?\"listen closely. I went back and fixed things so her horse died the day before. It was a simple thing, really, just a stray lightning bolt. Guess what happened?\"\n\"I\ndon't know, Sir.\"\n\"I'll\ntell you what happened. The Princess lived to a ripe old age. She\nbecame Queen. She became Empress. It was hideous. She unleashed a whole new breed of ruthless barbarians and sent my world crashing back about ten centuries. I couldn't submit a world like that for my senior project, so I tried to go back and undo my tampering. I crashed the whole thing and had to start all over, four weeks before the end of the semester. I barely passed. And that's why it's never wise to tamper with our worlds. All we can do is conceive them, build them, start them going, and watch what happens.\"became Queen. She became Empress.

What was the use of trying to tell the truth? Dunderclop was convinced\nthat he had dreamed up the canteen thing. He might as well face facts - if he\nexpected to pass this class, he would have to go along.\n\"Okay,\nSir,\" he mumbled. \"I'll go back again and fix it.\"\n\"That's\nbetter. Someday you're going to be a fine world-builder. They will come\nfrom across the Universe just to see your creations.\"\n\"Thank\nyou, Sir.\"\nDunderclop\ngave Yeliab a fatherly pat and ambled out of the room.\nChamberlain\nwiped the sweat from his forehead. 'This cursed heat,' he\nthought, and for a moment he dreamed of the cool, Maine coast where he had spent the summers before the war. He was suddenly very thirsty. He reached inside his tunic for his canteen and brought it to his lips. He took a long swallow. Before he was finished something hit him in the chest. He fell backwards and hit the ground with a thud. He lay still, gaping up at the smoke, the treetops, and the faint blue sky. His canteen fell away into the dust, and he reached his hand beneath his tunic. Warm blood bubbled up and spread across his chest. Faces gathered around him - the faces of his men. They looked down at him in shock, and some of them had begun to cry. He tried to tell them to see to the rebel charge, to let him be, but something had a tight grip on his vocal cords.thought, and for a moment he dreamed of the cool, Maine coast where he had spent the summers before the war.

A few moaned.\nSoon\nChamberlain was the only one left alive in the little circle. He turned his\nhead to the side and saw the colors of the First Maine being trampled into the\ndust. Tears welled up in his eyes. 'We should have won,' he thought. The last thing he ever saw in his life was the bare, bloody foot of the rebel soldier who stopped for a moment in front of him, before letting out a rebel yell and charging forward through the rear of the union lines.dust.

The south won that one. They broke through at Gettysburg\nand continued on to Washington. They captured Lincoln and the British and French\nrecognized the Confederacy. The north sued for peace shortly after.\"\n\"So\nwhere do the Germans come in?\"\n\"The\nnext century.\"\n\"You're\nconfusing me.\"\n\"I'm\nconfused myself, Sir. You should see what it feels like inside my head. My\nbrain is turning to mill mush, trying to keep track of it all.\"\nDunderclop\nchuckled. All world-builders reached this point sooner or later.\nIt came with the job.It came with the job.\n\"So\nanyway, the Germans won in 1940. It was a world war, the second one. The\nAmericans might have been able to help out but they didn't.\"\n\"Why\nnot? Weren't they on pace to become a world power?\"\n\"Yes\nthey were - until the south won the Civil War, of course. After that they\nall still called themselves Americans, but it was really just a bunch of\nindependent states. The south set the precedent when they won their\nindependence. So there was no united America to help stop the Germans.\"\n\"So\nnow you have the Germans ruling the world?\"\n\"Most\nof it. Actually, it\u2019s the political party inside the country that's running\nthings. They're called Nazis.\"\n\"So,\nwhat's the problem?\"\n\"You\nshould see these guys.\"\nDunderclop\nchuckled again. This was not the first time that nasty things had\nhappened in somebody's world. He thought back to his own experience with his Empress. \"Will you have to start again?\"happened in somebody's world.

His world\nhad ended in absolute failure. He watched fires burn on four of the five continents. Radiation levels soared everywhere he checked. Not much would survive.had ended in absolute failure. He watched fires burn on four of the five continents. Radiation levels soared everywhere he checked. Not much would survive.\nThere\nwas only one good thing about this whole, sordid mess. Yeliab was sure now that\nhe had been right. In spite of what his professor had said, he had proved that\nan ordinary can have an extraordinary effect on history, and he suspected that\nthe same was true for every civilization. It was a radical concept. He decided\nto save the documentation about Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain in his files.\nSomeday someone would be interested. It wouldn't be Dunderclop, though. He\nstill thought Yeliab had planted that canteen.\nYeliab\nswitched off the viewer and turned over onto his side. As he drifted off to\nsleep he thought that maybe he might be better suited for a career in the\ninsurance business, instead of building worlds.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20051003193024\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/janmar2002\/details.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The Internet's Premier Magazine of Historical Science Fiction","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/YaRoy697gvv+29xdGAWlanl5IuU.json","volume":3.0,"issues":1.0,"has_text":true}

In the crossing, the smashed\nwagon lay on its side, its contents scattered. The lighter\nthings had been carried far down the wash. One horse lay dead,\ntangled in its twisted traces. The other horse had made it\nsafely to the bank, and now stood prancing and wild-eyed where\nBob had it tethered to a willow tree.\nJamie,\nJamie, Sam continued to call, in a voice that was fast\ngrowing hoarse.\nSuddenly,\nBob grabbed Sam by the arm and yelled against the wind, Its\nno use, Jamie cant hear you. How could he have survived\nin all that water when he cant even swim. Bob\npaused, then added on a more hopeful note, Even if by\nsome miracle hes still alive, then hes been washed\ntoo far downstream to hear you.\nSam\njerked his arm from Bobs grasp. Hes my son---my\nonly son---I cant give up on him.\nI\nknow how you feel, Bob said with regret. But look\nhow deep the water was. He pointed towards a line of\ndebris ten feet up the side of wash. Below the high water\nmark, the bank was wet and washed clean, as if it had been\nswept with a broom.\nBut\nhes only seven years old, Sam said, his face twisting\nwith grief. He looked deep into Bobs eyes and pleaded,\nHelp me look for him\nweve got to find him.\nSam\nbroke into sobs, Even if hes beyond help, we cant\njust leave him out there for the\nHe couldnt\nbring himself to say the words, but Bob knew that Sam was\nthinking of the coyotes that were always skulking around after\ndark, looking for food.

And under\nhis breath Bob muttered, And I pray to God Im\nthe one to find him. He could only imagine what the\nshock of discovering Jamies lifeless body would do to\nSam. Frontier life was tough, and Sam was as tough as they\ncome, but no man should have to bury a son. It just wasnt\nright for a man to outlive his only child.\nSam\ncontinued downstream, looking amongst the clumps of tall grass\nthat had been laid flat by the torrent of water. Across the\nwash, he could hear Bob calling as he searched. By the time\nthey reached the bend of the wash, they had still found nothing.\nLets\nsearch down to the curve, Sam shouted across the wash\nto Bob.\nSam\nrounded the bend. Here the banks flattened out and sagebrush\ncrowded close on either side of the wash. He had gone only\nabout 50 feet when he heard a small thin voice. Daddy\nhelp\nme. Puzzled because the sound was coming from above\nhim, he looked up and saw Jamie. The boy was half-hidden from\nview by the foliage of a juniper tree, his arms and legs wrapped\ntightly around the trunk.\nBob,\nSam screamed with joy, Hes over here, hes\nalive!\nSam shinnied up the tree, gathered up his son in his arms\nand jumped back down to the sandy soil below. He hugged Jamie\ntightly for a long moment before he loosened his hold, held\nhim out at arms length then asked, How did you get up\nin that tree?\nJamie\ngrinned, A man saved me---there was a bright light and\nsuddenly there he was.\nIts\na miracle, Sam proclaimed. And then what happened?\nHe\nplucked me out of that water--- picked me up like I didnt\nweight nothing at all. Jamie got a look in his eyes,\na faraway look.

He nodded and said, It must have been an angel,\nsent down just to save you in your time of need, Jamie. You\nmust be one very special little boy.\nWith\nthe boy between them, together the three of them walked slowly\nback up Hardscrabble Wash, towards the crossing where the\nhorse waited.\nWe\nneed to get home. Your mother will be worried sick as it is,\nbecause we re so late, Sam said. She expected\nus home before dark.\nBob\nloosed the reins from the tree, speaking soothingly to the\nhorse, patting its neck and calming it down. As he lifted\nthe boy up onto the horses back, Bob asked, What happened\nto the angel after he saved you.?\nJamie\nreplied, He just walked back into the light and was\ngone. You know it was strange\nhe\nSam\ninterrupted his sons tale. I think Jamies\ntalked enough about his ordeal for now, The whole idea\nof angels made Sam feel strangely uncomfortable, even though\nthe angel had just saved his son from a watery death.\nThe\ntwo men slowly led the horse towards home, walking on either\nside of its head, each of them holding tightly to one of the\nreins. The horse was still nervous and they werent taking\nany chance of him getting spooked and running off.\nThe only sound, as they walked, was the plod of the horses\nhooves on the ground and the wind rustling through the leaves\non the trees. No one spoke a word, all three of them were\nlost in their own thoughts.\nBob\nwas musing about the sudden and miraculous appearance of an\nangel of light, out there in the middle of the wilderness.\nA heavenly being, a guardian angel whose only purpose that\nnight had been to save the life of a\nlittle boy. Bob could accept that; his faith was strong enough.\nSam\nwas of two minds. He was overjoyed at the safe return of Jamie,\nyet troubled by thoughts of how fragile life really was. How\nclose he had come to losing his son forever! The thought made\nhis put his hand out and rest it on Jamies knee, as\nif to reassure himself that his son truly was safe and sound.\nJamie\nbarely took note of his fathers touch. Jamie was reliving\nin his mind the strange events he had experienced that night,\nstarting with being sucked under water by the current and\nthen popping up to the surface like a cork. Just as he was\nbeing swept under the water again, there was a blinding light,\nand suddenly he was lifted out of the water by a strange being..\nThe\nbeings eyes had been dark and almond shaped and for\na long time he had gazed deep into Jamies eyes. Never\na word had been spoken between them, but\nthere was no need for words. They shared one mind, one thought,\none\nemotion and Jamie was flooded with a joy that he had never\nexperienced before in his short life. Instinctively, Jamie\nknew that he could never explain to anyone else exactly what\nhad happened---even if he had been able to find the right\nwords to describe it. Besides, who would believe him anyway?\nIn all likelihood his parents would probably punish him for\ntelling tales, if he ever did try to explain it\nall to them. . The being placed him up in the tree, then turned\nand disiappeared into the light. Silently, a large shiny object\nlifted up, sending out beams of light and sped across the\nsky, as fast as a shooting star.\nJamie knew that someday he and the being would meet again\nhe\nwas certain of it because the knowledge had been planted in\nhis mind that their paths would cross again sometime during\nhis lifetime.. Never again could he look at the night sky\nwithout thinking of the being, never again would he see a\nshooting star without breathing a Thank you under\nhis breath. And each night when the sun set and the stars\nappeared, he would peer out his bedroom window. Each night\nhe looked towards Hardscrabble Wash and waited.\nBack to top","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20051030131543\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/octdec2002\/hardscrabble.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/EB-ra1xEFEl-mJVoc3Be9LsKme0.json","volume":3.0,"issues":2.0,"has_text":true}

The Frenchman\nnodded, then caught himself as the ship bounced over another\nwave, one hand on the railing and the other to keep his\nhat from blowing away in the breeze of their swift passage.\n\"True, monsieur.\" he replied, \"but they have\nsome claim to that right, no?\"\nOf all the military delegates assembled on the Shires fast\ncruiser, he and the French major were perhaps the closest.\nHe knew the Russian chap slightly (a Count, and some lesser\nrelation to the Czar) and was on correct speaking terms\nwith the German fellow. The American was someone new, and\nhe didn't know the Japanese delegate at all.\n'The Frog is right.' Lord Wooldridge thought to himself.\n'Damn him.' They were standing on the after deck of a sleek\nwarship racing west across the sunny northern Caribbean\nat a steady 30 knots (few other ships could reach that speed,\nnone could sustain it). The Shire were arrogant upstarts,\nbut they had the right to be.\nIt was hard to imagine that less than 100 years ago a hardy\nband of Dutch intellectuals and adventurers had set out\nto create the new land which so dominated their thoughts\nnow. Using the same dikes by which their brethren reclaimed\nthe Zuider Zee, they had made a home for themselves in the\nsunny Caribbean on a shallow reef between Cuba, the Bahamas\nand Florida. Since then, Irish, Poles, Chinese, practically\nevery mongrel race on the planet had come crowding in and\nwhy it didn't collapse into anarchy was anyone's guess.\nBut in fact, they had flourished; and by tapping the restless\nenergies of those misplaced multitudes, they had grown in\nwealth and science and industry so as to command a respect\nfrom the major powers unique among small nations. Militarily,\nwhat the Shire lacked in size they made up in their cunning\nand fiendish weaponry. Several nations had run afoul of\nthem over the years, to their collective woe. So when they\ninvited the worlds' imperial powers to send military representatives\nto witness the test of a new weapon, the world powers took\nnotice. And when the Shire couched those invitations as\na curt demand, they started to wonder.\n*****\nThey had been at sea for about two hours when the roar of\nthe turbines suddenly dimmed and the ship settled in the\nwater. Ahead of them was the open ocean, but one populated\nwith ships and boats of all sizes. They were approaching\nanother Shire ship - this a small passenger vessel painted\npurest white - which was surrounded by steam yachts and\nsmaller craft that seemed to be filled with members of the\npress. Farther on, they could see several gunboats patrolling\na line of buoys demarking an open stretch of ocean that\nfaded off into the distance.\nThe fast cruiser drifted to a halt astern of the white ship\nand they had assembled on the after deck to meet the Shires'\nDefense Minister, Antoine Hogarthy, as he boarded. He was\ntall and stocky, with graying hair and a swarthy complexion.\nA Pole, obviously. The Russian and German delegates exchanged\nincredulous glances. He wasted no time on formalities and\ngot right to the point.\n\"The Shire has always relied on strategic innovation\nfor its defense, gentlemen.\" he began. \"And as\nyou know, the rising economic power of the Industrial Age\nhas challenged our innovative edge like never before. Where\nonce we could depend on your limited industrial base to\nkeep you from overwhelming us, now that advantage no longer\nexists.\"\nThe delegates absorbed this impassively. It was infuriating\nto be labeled as backward by these upstarts, but they all\nknew it was true. They also knew that they had not been\nsummoned all this way merely to be put upon.\n\"You all know the rising tensions in Europe and elsewhere.\"\nthe Minister cast a speculative glance at the American and\nthe Japanese. \"It is our firm belief that these rising\ntensions pose the risk a general European war, perhaps a\nWorld War, early in the coming century. So once more, we\nhave turned our thoughts to defense; to create new weapons\nthat will allow us to defeat ten enemies where the old would\ndefeat two.\"\nHe paused then, seemingly lost in some disturbing thought.\nAfter a moment, he added, \"But before we demonstrate\nthe newest results of our labors, I would like to take a\nmoment to discuss with you how we achieve our successes.\"\nThat got the delegates attention.\nThere was another long pause as he gathered his thoughts.\nThen he looked up and said, \"It is not that we have\nany dark, mystical powers that allow us to create our advanced\nweapons. These things are possible for any society that\nis willing to accept the possible.\"\n\"It all started when we received our first large group\nof immigrants from China. They brought with them an ancient\nmilitary lore of a fellow named Sun Tsu. The essence of\nthose teachings was to use creative solutions rather than\nmain force to solve military problems.\"\n\"You may recall our first real naval success some 60\nyears ago. We could never have built as many ships of the\nline as the British navy had. But then someone stated the\nobvious: we didn't need ships of the line. All we needed\nwas something that could sink them.\" He paused as the\ndelegates broke out in a collective murmur at this revelation.\n\"Thus our first explosive naval shells.\" the Minister\nwent on after a moment. \"All we did was fin stabilize\na cannonball and put a point on the front to drive like\na nail through a wooden hull before the shell exploded.\"\nThe result had been a decisive rout of a British battle\nsquadron by a flotilla of Shire frigates. \"A small\ninnovation, but the Royal Navy never understood what hit\nthem. It was all so damnably un-British.\" he gave a\nsardonic glance at Lord Wooldridge.\n\"Now see here, sir - - \" Lord Wooldridge huffed.\n\"Our advantage,\" the Minister overrode him, \"is\nthat we cherish new ideas and abhor the status quo. We seek\ninnovative solutions rather than slavishly copying what\neveryone else does. And above all, we believe in the power\nof scientific research!\" He surveyed the taut foreigners\nproudly. \"After all, we're proof that anything can\nhappen!\"\nThat was undeniable. A century ago, the Shire had been a\ncoral reef off the northern coast of Cuba. Today it was\na thriving pocket-sized civilization with the highest per-capita\nstandard of living in the world.\nThen there was a pause, and the Minister seemed to wilt.\nHis eyes dropped and he slumped against the rail as if stricken\nby some sudden grief.\n\"It says in the Bible that 'pride goeth before a fall'.\"\nHe went on in a low voice at last. He raised his head and\nlooked into their eyes. His pride was gone now, replaced\nby - fear? \"I regret, gentlemen, that our cleverness\nhas become hubris. Our quest for new scientific understandings\nhas opened a Pandora's Box. There comes a point where science\nbecomes too creative, where weapons become too powerful.\nIt appears we have reached that point.\"\nThere was a long, awkward silence as the delegates absorbed\nthat remarkable statement. The Shire had always relied on\ntechnical superiority for their defense and owed their independence\nto their unique ability to create new weapons on more than\none occasion. In a world dominated by ruthless imperial\nambitions, they stood alone in their ability confound the\ngreat powers. For the Shire to suddenly express abhorrence\nfor a new weapon was inconceivable.\n\"Und ven shall ve see das infernal machine, mien Herr?\"\nthe German major, demanded.\n\"Frankly sir,\" the Minister replied, \"we\nthink it better that you not get a look at it. But rest\nassured you will be convinced of its existence momentarily!\"\n\"A secret weapon?\" the American scoffed.\n\"It is there, on that ship.\" The Minister pointed\nout to the horizon. \"Here, use this telescope and see\nfor yourself.\"\nThe American lifted the instrument and squinted through\nit at a speck in the distance. \"It's a large cargo\nvessel,\" he said after a moment, \"painted bright\nred.\" The others crowded around him, squabbling over\nthe instrument to examine the distant target. What they\nsaw was a seemingly deserted ship anchored in the middle\nof a large vacant area of the sea. It was indeed painted\na brilliant scarlet and bore a legend, DANGER STAY AWAY,\nin large block letters on its side. A row of buoys marched\naway from it toward the white ship and a thick sheaf of\ncables emerged from the sea and vanished into that ships\ninterior. On the white ships deck, the few crewmen they\ncould see were dressed in some sort of heavy protective\nclothing.\n\"The weapon itself is quite small.\" the Minister\nadded. \"We used that ship as a temporary laboratory\nto construct it. She has remained here at anchor for months\nwhile the final test prototype was assembled, safely away\nfrom our homes and schools.\"\nAt that moment there were footsteps and the captain of the\nfast cruiser, O'Malley, came on deck. He was carrying a\nclip board with a yellow message form pinned to it. \"Message\nfrom the command ship, Minister. They are ready for the\ntest.\"\n\"Thank you, Captain.\" the Minister replied. \"And\nnow, gentlemen, the new weapon will be detonated momentarily,\nso I must ask you all to turn and face in the opposite direction\nto protect your eyes.\" He moved among them, coaxing\nthem into position by taking their elbows.\n\"You propose that we witness a weapons test by not\nlooking at it, monsieur?\" the Frenchman scoffed. \"But\nof course, that would be only natural for a secret weapon,\nno?\"\n\"Trust me sir, this is for your own protection.\"\nthe Minister cautioned him.\nWhatever the Frenchman might have said in reply was lost,\nas they were suddenly bathed in a horrible, intolerable\nwhite light. Instinctively, they all turned to see what\nhad happened, but were blinded and repelled by the agonizing\nglow. Within seconds, however, it had faded enough that\nthey could see the vast ball of white fire which had erupted\nwhere the target ship once sat.\n\"Oh, dear God!\" someone gasped as they craned\ntheir heads to watch the fireball rise slowly, majestically,\ninto the air on a thick column of roiling cloud. Below,\nthe target area was shrouded in an expanding layer of billowing\nsteam and foam, and they could see the shock wave spreading\nout through the water like a vast ripple in a pond.\nThen, a long time later, the sound of the explosion came\nto them: not a bang or a boom, but a sustained rumble like\nan earthquake. The sound penetrated their bones and their\nsouls, telling them of a power so vast that no mere explosive\nnoise would do it justice.\n\"That, gentlemen, is the power of the positive.\"\nMinister Hogarthy said gravely, \"And our dilemma.\"\nThe foreigners were stunned by the magnitude of the explosion,\nlooking bewildered at each other and at the Minister. Finally,\nthe Russian delegate stammered, \"What - what is this\nthing we witnessed?\"\n\"We call it an atom bomb.\" the Minister replied,\ngravely. \"What you just saw was a small one, we estimate\nit the equal of 100,000 tons of gunpowder.\"\n\"But - but - but - - how?\" Lord Wooldridge stammered,\nshaken. \"How does it work?\"\n\"You will forgive me sir,\" the Minister said bleakly,\n\"if I decline to answer.\" Addressing them all,\nhe went on. \"What you have just witnessed is an entirely\nnew principle of explosive force created by previously unknown\nlaws of naturalism. It relates to atoms, the smallest unit\nof matter, hence the name. In essence, at the 'atomic level',\nmatter and energy are two different forms of the same thing.\nWe have discovered that that it is possible, under certain\nconditions, to convert matter directly into energy,\"\nhe waved his arm in a sweeping gesture to the slowly disbursing\nmushroom cloud, \"with devastating results.\"\n\"Well!\" the American said after a long moment,\ngazing up at the still rising cloud.\n\"It would appear you do possess an infernal machine\nafter all, monsieur!\" the Frenchman gasped. \"!Ce\nn'est pas extraordinaire, ca? Your positive genius has triumphed!\nI fear this will give you the power to defeat ten enemies,\nand many more than ten enemies, at your pleasure.\"\n\"You completely miss the point, sir!\" the Minister\nshook his head. \"Weapons of such magnitude make war\nunwinnable, perhaps even unsurvivable. Ten of them could\ndevastate any country, a hundred could reduce Europe to\nchaos! War is a luxury we can no longer afford!\"\nThe assembled dignitaries were dumbfounded. The Shire was\nterrified of its own creation, and with good reason! \"And\nwhat do you propose, sir?\" the Englishman asked incredulously.\n\"We must change our wicked ways, gentlemen, lest we\nare undone by our own folly.\" the Minister responded\nurgently. \"I can assure you these weapons are not all\nthat difficult to build once one knows the secret. Any determined\npower can build one! The old imperialism must end before\nsome ambitious fool brings destruction down upon us all!\nThe Shire proposes that all the nations of the earth join\ntogether to create a world government; an arbitration body\nwhich can resolve disputes and enforce the peace - \"\n\"What you propose is preposterous!\" the Russian\ninterrupted. \"You would deny the very God-given sovereignty\nof the Czar, not to mention the other royal heads of Europe!\"\n\"As of today, sovereignty isn't what it used to be.\"\nthe Minister replied. \"As for the present state of\nGod, well, I'm not sure I want to know.\"\n\"And what of any state that refuses to join this world\ngovernment?\" Lord Wooldridge demanded. \"Will you\nthen use this terror bomb on them?\"\n\"We do not threaten you, sir.\" the Minister replied\ngravely. \"These monstrous weapons cannot be rattled\nlike a saber! This demonstration was to show you all the\nmoral peril we face and to convince you that we must act\ntogether!\"\nThe argument went on for some time, the Minister pressing\nhis case for a new world order and the delegates raising\nendless objections. Try as he would, it was soon clear that\nthey did not appreciate the danger. They thought only of\nthis horrific new bomb and how they might possess it, or\nkeep others from possessing it, or how to use it. In the\nend, the blinding white glow of the bomb dazzled them. His\npleas were rejected.\n*****\n\"Do you think it worked?\" Captain O'Malley asked\nthe Minister later. \"That was certainly an impressive\ndemonstration!\"\n\"Ten thousand tons of guncotton and powdered magnesium?\nI should think so!\" Hogarthy replied with a grin. \"It\nhad our British friend going for sure!\"\n\"You know, we were lucky that worked.\" the Captain\nsaid earnestly. Lucky they weren't all blown up trying to\nassemble that much touchy explosive in one spot. \"Getting\nall those detonators to go off at the same instant was not\neasy. Had it misfired, we would look like some sort of fools.\"\nHe didn't add that, had their bluff been called, their relations\nwith the major world powers would have taken a significant\nturn for the worse.\n\"Thankfully it did.\" Hogarthy replied. \"And\nunless I miss my guess, we've just triggered the downfall\nof the monarchies.\"\n\"I hope so, sir.\" the Captains mood turned somber.\n\"We simply can't keep up with them any more. If we\ncan't convince them to destroy themselves, they'll overwhelm\nus by sheer weight of material sooner or later.\"\nAs the Minister had said: the Shire had always relied on\nstrategic innovation for its defense. And in the face of\nthe growing industrial power in Europe and America, their\nstrategy was as cunning as it was ambitious. The great powers\nthought more of their own imperial glory than the well being\nof their people. Their fatuous arrogance had led to an arms\nrace that was getting bigger and more menacing by the year.\nNow the inbred aristocracies were faced with the prospect\nthat someone - anyone - might develop a hideous new weapon\nthat could smash cities and devastate armies. They would\nhave to bow before this supposed superbomb or fight: and\nby their lights, any slight to their sovereign glory was\na mortal stain not to be borne by their sacred soil, the\nVatterland, Holy Mother Russia, whatever. The Shires gambit\nwould cause them to tear each other apart in a series of\npreemptive wars until their monarchies collapsed, bringing\nthe Age of Empire and the threat to the Shire to an end.\nSun Tsu would have been pleased.\n\"It's a shame about that world government idea, though.\"\nthe Captain said. \"Life would be a whole lot easier\nonce this entire planet is civilized.\"\n\"True.\" the Minister replied. \"But sadly,\nthat will never happen. It's just not in human nature. But\nat least that noble pipe-dream will serve as a useful red\nherring.\"\nAs the fast cruiser turned for home, the Captain gazed back\nat the spot where human history had just been changed. The\nimplications of what they had done still bothered him. \"Er,\nyou don't suppose that one day someone really will develop\na superbomb, do you? What if that nonsense about matter\nand energy could actually be made to work?\"\n\"God!\" the Minister said fervently, \"I hope\nnot! Can you imagine such weapons in the hands of those\nmorons?\"","source":"http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20051030132526\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/julysept2003\/thinkpositive.htm","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/+Z0gmb4+Qe8+qXuQPIGJjowG+Lw.json","volume":4.0,"issues":3.0,"has_text":true}

Christmas\nwas in less than\nthree weeks and I\u2019d been called on for my mother\u2019s\nsake, due to her strange erratic behavior. Driving into\ntown, I could see that Hatten hadn\u2019t changed at all;\nit was still a small quaint town that didn\u2019t fancy\nstrangers or new comers. Coloreds were a whole different\nstory and were, of course, one of the reasons that I had\nleft home more than three years before and had not returned.\nEven for my father\u2019s funeral.\nThomas Thather had died\nalmost a year before. My mother sent word that he had\npassed only after he\u2019d been dead and buried for a\nfull month, and so there was no real reason for me to come\nback. At least that was what I told myself. But the reason\nhad lay within that house on Hatten Hill. Deep within the\nwalls of what had been my home for more than twenty years.\nAnd in that room where Ben disappeared.\nWhen I drove down Hatten\nDrive, a road, like the town, that had been named\nafter my family, my motorcar bounced uncontrollably and\nit brought back some of the strange feelings that I\u2019d\nhad during my childhood. Then I began to get the feeling\nthat Hatten House was glad that I had come home. I would\nswear that I heard it sigh. Perhaps, however, with only\nthe moan of decades of stress. The road hadn\u2019t been\npaved over then, but since it has been. Since my mother,\ntoo, has died. A feeling of deja\u2019 ve seeded itself\ndeep in my soul and I could not loose it even as I stepped\ninto the house.\n\u201cYoung David!\u201d\nThe voice boomed through the foyer.\n\u201cHattie Mae!\u201d\nWe hugged tightly. I had really missed her. Probably more\nthan anyone else, maybe it was because she had been my mother\nin those days. Hattie Mae was my nanny. She was colored.\n\u201cHouse sure has been\nquite lonely without you, boy.\u201d She giggled, her chubby\ntummy bounding like Santa Clause.\nI smiled in spite of myself.\nI\u2019d sworn that I would not get back into things here.\nThat I would not allow anyone to break through, convincing\nme to stay on.\n\u201cYour mother\u2019s\nin the sittin\u2019 room.\u201d\nI followed her into the\nroom where my mother sat in front of the fireplace, just\nstaring. Staring into the fire almost like\u2026 she was\nsomewhere else. Her honey nut hazel eyes twinkled with far\naway thoughts.\n\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d\nHattie Mae called.\nShe didn\u2019t stir.\nHattie Mae smiled at me,\n\u201cShe does this sometimes, just stares like that. Like\nshe ain\u2019t here at all. Like she\u2019s gone to somewhere\ncain\u2019t nobody finds her. Ma\u2019am!\u201d\nI walked over and sat on\nthe sofa next to my mother, \u201cMother?\u201d I shook\nher arm, \u201cMother!\u201d I was beginning to think\nthat perhaps she had sat there and died. And that the glazed\nlook in her eyes was simply a glimpse of death and nothing\nmore.\n\u201cMother.\u201d I\nsaid again and shook her fiercely.\n\u201cHm? What, what is\nit?\u201d She looked around the room and finally focused\non me. \u201cDavid, is that you?\u201d\nShe touched my face and\na shock of electricity passed though us. \u201cIt\u2019s\nme, mother. Are you alright?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine,\ndear. I was dreaming that I saw your father. We were at\nthe beach. You remember when we use to go to the beach,\nDavid? You loved it there.\u201d\nI nodded my head and took\nthe moment to look her over. She had grown older\nsince I\u2019d seen her last. She looked thin, frail. Her\nhair had gone almost completely white and her skin was like\npaper.\nWe ate dinner out on the\nbalcony that evening. Hattie Mae had fixed my favorite childhood\nmeal; steak and ice cream. My mother sat rather quietly\nthe entire meal and simply smiled at the right time when\nI told a joke.\nWe didn\u2019t have much\nto talk about since we hadn\u2019t seen each other in several\nyears, and in fact, hadn\u2019t really spoke before I\u2019d\nleft. My mother and I\u2019d had the typical mother and\nchild relationship, for a Hattten Hills family. If you counted\nthat we were well off. Better than well off, we were worthy,\nmy father would say. Depends on who\u2019d you ask, if\nI had to say. Rich didn\u2019t always mean better, if you\nknow what I mean.\nAfter dinner my mother retired\nto her quite room. Hattie Mae told me she spent most of\nher time there now. Hardly ever came out any more, she said.\nTalks to no one in there, and sometimes\u2026\u201d She\ndidn\u2019t say anything after that and I didn\u2019t\npush her about it. The less I knew about my mother - the\nless involved I got in her affairs - the better.\nIn my room I put my things\naway and sat on my bed. Nothing much had changed in here.\nMy pictures of horses still hung on the walls. My blue bedspread\nwith the red and white stripes covered the bed and my dresser\nsat lonely in the corner.\nFrom the room next door\ncame a loud thump. I stood to my feet, walked over to the\nwall. I thought I heard voices. Talking in a muffled voice,\nwhispers. I leaned in putting my head to the wall, listened.\nI could hear my mother talking. But at first couldn\u2019t\nmake out what it was that she had said. Then slowly I began\nto make out a few words at a time.\nSomething like, \u201cHe\nloves stake and ice cream. Always has.\u201d But her voice\nwas different, it was like it had been when she was younger.\nThen came another voice,\nit was deeper, but I couldn\u2019t quite make out what\nwas said. The words seemed father away. Like talking on\nthe wire, to someone in another state. Long distance.\nI walked out of my room\nand over to the quite room door. The noises seemed\nlouder here. I distinctively heard a man talking, but still\nI didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d said. There was a dim\nlight coming from under the door raining into the hall.\nIt covered my bare feet dying my toes a pale bluish color.\nI knocked on the door. There\nwas another loud thump and my mother screamed,\n\u201cBen, don\u2019t run in the house!\u201d I froze;\nI hadn\u2019t heard anyone say that name in two decades.\nI looked behind me and saw Hattie Mae coming up the stairs.\nThe voices got louder, almost\nlike everyone was beginning to scream, all at once. But\nthat wasn\u2019t it. No, it was as though they were getting\ncloser; as if they were coming from far away and were drawing\nnearer. I looked at Hattie Mae, and she stared at me, her\neyes soft like they use to be when I was a kid.\nThe light under the door\ngrew brighter and extended longer and longer each time it\nflared. I had to see who was in there, and what they were\ndoing.\nI grabbed the doorknob,\nflung the door open and jumped in as if I were catching\na thief. Inside my mother sat alone, staring at me strangely.\n\u201cWhat is it, David?\u201d\nShe asked.\nHattie Mae had followed\nme into the room and she walked over to my mother\nhelping her to her feet, \u201cIt\u2019s getting late,\nMa\u2019am. Lets get you off to bed.\u201d\nI searched the room. No\none was there.\nLater, Hattie Mae came into\nmy room without the benefit of a knock on my door like she\nwould do when I was a child.\n\u201cGood to have you\nhome again, Young David.\u201d She wore a checkered handkerchief\non her head and it took me back to a place that I had forgotten\nlong before. A place that I wasn\u2019t sure that I wanted\nto go to again. She smiled and closed the door behind her.\nThe next day I found my mother in the garden behind the\nhouse. Sitting and staring. My mother had managed to keep\nit up.\nThen she spoke; \u201cDid\nyou know that Hatten House wasn\u2019t always called as\nsuch?\u201d She spoke without bothering to look at me.\n\u201cI\u2019m too old now to remember what they use to\ncall it, though. Something like the place that changes you.\u201d\n\u201cHow are you feeling\nthis morning, mother?\u201d\n\u201cYoung David, that\u2019s\nwhat Hattie Mae calls you. You like it when she calls you\nthat?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\nNot really.\u201d It was a lie\nShe kept talking almost\nas if she hadn\u2019t heard me at all. \u201cShe was always\nlike your mother. You loved her more than me. I know that.\u201d\n\u201cNo, mother\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh yes. Yes you do.\nI would see the way you\u2019d hold on to her, when you\u2019d\nfall and hurt yourself. You were almost like her own. You\nsuckled from her nipple, did you know that?\u201d\nI didn\u2019t bother answering.\nI figured that she was getting to that age when she looked\nback on her life and didn\u2019t like a lot of what she\nsaw.\n\u201cThat was all I knew,\u201d\nshe continued. \u201cMy mother had raised me and my brother\nthat way. But you always had the finest things. And we did\nthe best we could with Ben. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nI walked over to her, put\nmy hand on her shoulder, \u201cI know that.\u201d\n\u201cDo you remember him?\nHe sure watched over you, being a few years older. You followed\nbehind him like he was the best thing you\u2019d ever seen.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember\nmuch, to be honest. Only little things, like the songs.\u201d\nI began singing, lost in the thoughts of the mind of a five-year-old\nchild, \u201c\u2019All around the Mulberry bush, the monkey\nchased the weasel.\u2019 Or something like that.\u201d\n\u201cYou remember that?\u201d\n\u201cYes. And dogs and\nsomething happened. Something bad. What was it Mother? I\nthink I use to remember, but not anymore.\u201d\nShe smiled at me, her eyes\nhad changed. She was gone again. \u201cDid you know\nthey didn\u2019t always call this Hatten Hills?\u201d\n*\nInside Hattie Mae broke\nthe green beans for dinner. She sat at the sink and\nwhistled an old tune that I couldn\u2019t quite place.\nMy mother had been right, I did have very fond memories\nof Hatie Mae. Motherly memories. I walked over and put my\narms around her shoulder - a gesture that I would have never\nafforded my mother.\n\u201cHow\u2019s your\nmother?\u201d\n\u201cShe seemed fine for\na moment, but was not herself the next.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s that\nway sometimes now.\u201d Hattie Mae reached up and grabbed\nmy hand\nholding it close to her face.\n\u201cHattie Mae, before\nmy mother left herself again, she mentioned something I\nhadn\u2019t thought about in a long time. Ben.\u201d\nShe quickly let go of my\nhand, \u201cBen? What did she say about him?\u201d\n\u201cJust that I looked\nup to him.\u201d I grabbed a raw green bean and put it\nin my mouth, longing more for something to fill the silence,\nthan anything else.\nJust then a loud crash came\nfrom the top floor. I jump a foot. Hattie Mae stared upward,\nstanding to her feet. She didn\u2019t move as quick as\nshe once had, so it seemed to take her forever to get off\nthe stool.\nI dashed out of the kitchen\nand up the stairs. I looked around as the loud crash came\nagain, sounding louder this time as I was only a few feet\nfrom it. I came from the sitting room.\nJust as I flung the door\nopen the noise came again. A young colored man stood behind\nthe door. I focused on him as from the corner of my eye\nI saw the room change from our furnishing to something of\na whole new shape and style. It shimmered a kaleidoscope\nof colors, moving as I watched. The man himself did not\nchange, although he looked strange in his attire, his head\nalmost shaved bare, his clothing new and shoes polished.\nBut something was strange\nabout him, I felt somehow that I had seen him before.\nDespite my present circumstance,\nI was not afraid. I was bewildered. I did not feel threatened.\nI felt curious. My mind raced with answers, as I came to\nthe conclusion that I must be dreaming.\nThen the entire mirage shifted\nas if it were a child\u2019s toy viewer sliding to a new\nscene. Then it was gone.\nHattie Mae had not followed\nme up this time, she stood down stairs with my mother by\nher side. My mother was my mother once again.\nI screamed; I couldn\u2019t\ncontrol myself. \u201cWhat in the hell is gone on here?\nDo you know what I just saw? No, you can\u2019t know. Hell,\nI don\u2019t even know.\u201d\n\u201cYoung David, please\nsit down. Calm yourself.\u201d\nI paced back and forth.\n\u201cYou know what I saw, don\u2019t you?.\u201d\nShe chewed on her bottom\nlip for a moment and slowly began to speak. \u201cDo you\nremember, David, what happened to Ben?\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cI\njust remember a few things. Smells. Clothing. Songs.\u201d\nShe looked at Hattie Mae\nand then back at me, \u201cLet me ask you, David, have\nyou ever walked into the room and switched on the lights\nand caught something, something that just wasn\u2019t quite\nright. Something that shimmered or moved when you were the\nonly person in the room?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s just\nthe lights playing tricks with your eyes.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than\nthat, David. Have you ever been somewhere and you\u2019re\nsure that\nsomething just brushed up against you, but you were alone?\nHave you ever experienced deja\u2019 ve and just know that\nyou\u2019ve done this very thing before, but can\u2019t\nfor the life of you know when or where?\u201d\nI nodded, not sure where\nshe was going with this.\n\u201cHave you ever been\nin your motor car and catch a ripple of something in the\ndistance and when you get up on it, it\u2019s gone?\u201d\nShe paused, \u201cI say all of this to explain that within\nthis house, within those walls of the sitting room, those\nthings are reality. Something is special about Hattie Hill\nand that is why the Indians valued it and that is why your\ngreat grandfather chose it. In that room David, I can still\nsee your father. And I can still see Ben as a young boy.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s crazy.\nYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s true David.\nHattie Mae here can see them two.\u201d\nI was silent.\n\u201cSomebody once said\nthat right now is past, present, and future all at once.\nI think that is true here at Hatten House.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\nI was a college-educated man. A student of common sense.\n\u201cDo you remember what\nhappened to Ben?\u201d\n\u201cI told you I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cTry to remember.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\nShe reached out her hand\nand clutched mine. \u201cFollow me.\u201d\nShe led me up stairs to\nthe sitting room. I stood outside that door, afraid to open\nit. \u201cGo on.\u201d She said. \u201cIt\u2019s alright.\nI\u2019ve been back there a few times myself.\u201d\nI reached out, opened the\ndoor, and stepped inside. As soon as I had, I began falling.\nI fell thousands of feet at a rate of seconds. Decades of\npast, present and future passed me by.\nI saw my father\u2019s\nfuneral, and my mother\u2019s as well. I saw Hattie Mae,\nwho out\nlived them all, crying over my mothers casket. I saw a chubby\nchocolate face smiling as I passed it by, and my seventh\nbirthday. I had just enough time to count the candles.\nThen I landed. I was standing\nin the foyer, but something was different. There it was;\nthe chest that my mother had given away years before was\nthere. And that picture of the horse that my father kept\nin his study.\nSuddenly I became aware\nof a loud dog barking in the distance. And a loud gunshot\nrang throughout the room, shaking the windowpanes.\nI was there; I was back\nto the day it had all happened.\nAt once a young, ebony Ben\nof about fifteen came running through the front door. He\nopened it so hard it slammed into the wall knocking my hanging\nhorse picture to the floor, shattering it to prices. That\u2019s\nright, that\u2019s what had happened to it.\nAs he ran in, my mother\nand Hattie Mae came from the kitchen to see were the\nnoise had come. \u201cBen, stop that running in the house,\u201d\nmy mother had shouted as he ran into the study where my\nfather was slow to respond. He stood to his feet and looked\nat Ben.\n\u201cThey. After. Me.\u201d\nHe was out of breath.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d My father\npulled back the window curtain and I could see several men\nin the distance with dogs and shotguns. One man held up\nhis gun and fired into the air again.\n\u201cChrist,\u201d Mother\nsaid.\nBen had calmed down a bit\nand was able to speak more clearly. \u201cThey said I\nshamed Dr. Peterson\u2019s daughter. I ain\u2019t done\nso such thang, sir. I ain\u2019t touched her.\n\u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t,\nBen.\u201d\nMy father looked at my mother\njust as another gunshot was fired and in those two seconds\nI knew a decision had been made. My father grabbed Ben\u2019s\nhand and ran over to Hattie Mae and my mother.\n\u201cWhen they come, tell\nthem you haven\u2019t seen him. They won\u2019t rightly\nbelieve you Hattie Mae, so you\u2019ll have to set them\nstraight.\u201d He told my mother. \u201cIt won\u2019t\nhold them for long, but it\u2019ll be just long enough.\u201d\nI remember, remembering\nmy five-year-old mind trying to digest all that was\nhappening. It was hard for an adult, but for me, Ben was\nmy brother.\nFather dashed up the stairs\nwith Ben and went into the sitting room and slammed the\ndoor behind them, just as the men ran into the still-open\ndoor.\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d\nOne man shouted, his big brown dog barking loudly. I remember\nthe smelled of old dog poop and onions. Just then, the other\nmen followed, some with guns, some had bats. Doctor Patterson\nwas with them.\nMy mother stepped forward,\nI could see her shaking under her skin, but she\ndidn\u2019t back down to them, \u201cWhat is all this?\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the\nboy? Dogs say he came in here.\u201d\n\u201cWhat boy? David\u2019s\nbeen here all day.\u201d\n\u201cYou know very well\nwho I mean. That nigger boy. Where\u2019s he?\u201d\nHattie Mae walked over to\nthe man, ignoring his dog, \u201cWhat you wont with my\nboy?\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t answer her,\nsimply reached out and slapped her. Hard. She fell to the\nfloor and mother ran over to comfort her.\nShe bent down and shouted\nup at the man, \u201cHarold Jenkins, you oaf! How dare\nyou?\u201d\nThen the doctor walked over\nto the five-year-old me and scratched my head. Like a dog,\nhe did. \u201cHallo,\u201d he said. \u201cDavid, do you\nremember me?\u201d\nI didn\u2019t move.\n\u201cYou go to school\nwith my Carrie.\u201d He smiled. \u201cHave you seen Ben,\nDavid?\u201d\nMy mother and Hattie Mae\nlooked at me. I felt strange. I didn\u2019t know what\nto do. I liked Dr Patterson and he had always been nice\nto me. And my mother had told me never to lie.\nThe Dr. stood between me\nand my view of Hattie Mae, \u201cDid he come in here,\nDavid?\u201d\nI watched in horror as I\nnodded my head. No! I hadn\u2019t done that. Had I? I\ndidn\u2019t remember this at all. I couldn\u2019t have\ndone it. No! No!\nThe doctor smiled, \u201cGood\nboy. Where did he go?\u201d\nI pointed to the top of\nthe stairs. All at once the men all dashed up to the top\nfloor and began checking all of the rooms.\nThe real thirty-nine-year-old\nme let a tear fall from his face for the sins that the young\nDavid had committed against his family. Finally the men\nall circled around the sitting room door as one man kicked\nit open. They all ran in and we could hear things being\nbroken up there.\nBut the room was empty.\nWhen the men had satisfied themselves that the house was\nclean, my mother walked up to me and hugged me telling me\nthat I had done the right thing. I remember even then not\nfeeling that this was the truth.\n*\nIn the end, I did that which\nI had sworn I wouldn\u2019t do; I chose to stay on at Hatten\nHouse. I think fondly of my parents; they are not the people\nwhom they seemed to be on the outside. I still visit the\nroom where Ben disappeared often. But it\u2019s just to\nsit and daydream. I, like my father, have learned the value\nof the room. But I, unlike my father, have found no real\nreason to use it. Perhaps that is a good thing in these\ntimes.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050905180510\/http:\/\/wouldthatitwere.com\/julysept2004\/ben.htm","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/gZiXRSZpzueSjwHAzTILR7q5kF8.json","volume":5.0,"issues":2.0,"has_text":true}

Yeah, you\u2019ve read those words before. And\nso what\u2019s so special about me and my story, you ask. It\u2019s a valid\nquestion. Who really cares about what I have to say? But humor me just for a\nwhile, and hear my story.\nYou\nhave a nice world here. Do you know that? Who was it who said that this is the\nbest of all possible worlds? I\u2019m not sure; I can never remember his name\nright. But I know that this quote is true. You want proof, or some\nmelodramatic story. Okay, this story is something like that, though not quite\nwhat you\u2019d expect. Close enough.\nHistory,\nand change, have never been about the big things. Or the big events. It\u2019s\nabout the small ones. In my world the president still got shot on that fateful\nday in Dallas. In my world World War II still happened. Those where big\nevents. They don\u2019t seem to change, unfortunately.\nNo,\nthese stories aren\u2019t what I\u2019m going to tell you about.\nMy\nstory is about the little steam car that could. Or, in your case, couldn\u2019t.\nI\nmiss my car. I work now in a bookstore. It\u2019s lo-tech and I like it: the\nsmell of decaying old paper and the sheer luxury of holding up printing matter\non dead trees still gives me little\nthrill-shivers. Sometimes kids come in for a book about cars and talk about\nthe thrill of a corvette\u2019s acceleration. They have no idea what true power\nfeels like.\nMy\nlittle steamer, when you opened the throttle, would lift its front end off the\nground if you weren\u2019t careful. In Britain, 1907, near Lancaster, the local\nautomobile club held yearly hill climbing competitions with their cars.\nMercedes, Daimler, and many of the other greats showed up to show who could\nscale the hill the fastest.\nThe\nsteamers swept out the competition and were banned from entering again.\nThat\u2019s\nin this world. You can find the article \u2018The last\nHill-climbing Contest in which Steam Cars were permitted to compete with\nPetrol Cars\u2019 in the\nperiodical Steam Car Developments and Steam\nAviation. Vol.IV JUNE, 1935 No. 40.\nDon\u2019t\nlaugh about the steam aviation part.\nSteam\nis always with us. Even in your world. You certainly don\u2019t think about it\nmuch in this world, but most of your domestic power comes from steam turbines.\nAnd is such a huge leap for you to realize that the entire American continent\nwas tamed with steam? Remember the change wrought across the European\ncontinent by the industrial revolution, and remember that steam powered that.\nSo\nhow was it that the revolution of the personal transport, the car, didn\u2019t\nbase itself off steam? It would make sense, since steam powered everything\nelse. Why not continue? If one reads history carefully one can see that people\nwere trying to make steam cars for longer than just the turn of the twentieth\ncentury. In fact some of the earliest references to the steam powered personal\nvehicle go back to the early 1800s: in 1803 Richard\nTrevithick of Cornwall built a steamer running at 12 miles an hour. In 1866 a\nRichard Dudgeon created a steam wagon that you can still view in Providence,\nRhode Island... I could prattle on about all the near points where this world\ncould have been infected by the steam car, but I won\u2019t. You get a glimpse of\nthe picture. In my world Trevithick built his steamer, and just as in yours it\nwas outlawed because it kept blowing up. In my world, just as in yours,\nDudgeon\u2019s steam wagon never really came to be much more than a curio, like\nthe Aztecs viewed the wheel.\nBut\nin my world, at that critical point in the mid-twenties, we chose steam and\nexternal combustion instead of the internal gasoline engine. Think of the\ninternal combustion engine in the twenties. It was loud, temperamental,\ndangerous. The crank handle required effort, and sometimes would snap back and\nbruise, sometimes break, your arm. Of course the elegant hiss of steam was\npreferable. But not in your world. And why was that?\nI\u2019ll\ntell it to you straight enough: this world doesn\u2019t have steam cars because I\njumped through time and set it up that way.\nSimple\nenough.\nYou\nwant to know all about the time machine and the paradoxes. I claim ignorance.\nAnd I didn\u2019t try to kill anyone\u2019s grandfather. I didn\u2019t invent the damn\ncontraption, but I used it. Oh, I can tell you what it looked like:\nIt\nwas covered in brass. Tons of plates of brushed brass. There were a number of\npint-sized lads that the labratory had running around with rags and polish to\nkeep it gleaming at all times. The time machine was the size of a good block\nof warehouse on the docks, and that was where they kept it. I never could tell\nwhere the building left and the machine began, but sometimes I could guess.\nCopper tubing ran everywhere. It snaked in from the ceiling, ran through the\ngirders. Wiring hung in clusters that lead to dials and all sorts of doo-hickeys.\nThe\ncontrol panels took up three walls and were housed in a building just off from\nthe machine. The bloody things took a team of fifty scientists just to read\nthem. Then there was the lead shielded building that housed the reactor. And\nthat was just to power the equipment that observed and controled the machine\n(and the onsite reactor did not actually run the time machine; running the\ntime machine took the entire country!) Tubes of piping and steam venting\ncovered the grounds like some Escher painting, and all around, everywhere I\nwalked, was the constant background hiss.\nAt\nthe time, one of the head scientists, Geoffrey Stives, slapped me on the back\nand said. \u201cWell what do you think of it all, old boy?\u201d\n\u201cI\nhope it works.\u201d\nThey\u2019d\nchosen me for this daft project because after being run through Her\nMajesty\u2019s Royal Forces I knew ninety eight ways to kill a man with shovel.\nAnd they\u2019d chosen me to go back in time to kill Hitler and make the world a\nbetter place.\nAnd\nthe time machine did work. I sat in the middle of a huge brass globe one\nchilly morning. Huge pistons hissed and the globe spun around me. Contacts and\nelectricity arced up over into the masts sprouting from the ceiling, and then\nthere was a huge \u2018wumph\u2019 of displaced air. I found myself sitting in a\nmound of snow trying desperatly to catch my breath because of the thin\nmountain air of the Alps.\nIt\nis hard to kill Hitler. Causality doesn\u2019t like to be buggered with. Things\nkeep popping up to protect the flow of events. And the one time I did actually\nget to stand there with a rifle and pop him off, I returned up-time to find\nthat some other chap had replaced him and things had gone on much as they were\nsupposed to.\nEventually,\nafter all our tries, we only had the power to do one more hop. This was it;\nthe final bit of travel authorized by the government, then back to life as\nusual. And we hadn\u2019t really changed anything or made the world better at\nall. What you have to understand is that time travel takes an enormous amount\nof energy and the whole country had gone on energy rations for almost two\nyears to power the time jumps.\nWe owed the people\nsomething.\nSo\nI went out for a drive in my car. My last real drive. I still maintain\nthat driving an internal combustion car is not real driving. I say that\nemphatically. It was snowy and bitterly cold and it had been for a couple\nyears now. The greenhouse effect was hitting us all hard because there were no\nforests to speak of. And additionally all our steam powered machinery\ncontributed to the effect with emissions.\nAs\nI drove down into Oxford it occurred to me that maybe we weren\u2019t trying to\nchange the world for the better in quite the right way. Maybe\nthere was something I could do that was small, but that would change\neverything.\nI\nfound a library, and I began to read.\nLet\nme tell you about the world as I once knew it. We flew nuclear steam powered\nplanes. We used nuclear steam powered locomotives, ships, even tanks. When\nthey crashed they would leave radioactive hotspots. And although flying was\nsafer than driving the planes still occasionally fell from the sky. We did all\nthis because we didn\u2019t want to use alternate fuels until too late. We were\naccustomed to what we had and were unwilling to change. When I left to go back\nin time the country was in the middle of a national program to change over to\nfossil fuels. But industry dragged its feet. Using nuclear power was easier\nthan trying to retool the entire industry and the parts it used. Mining large\nscale for petrol was not something invest in when we already had cheap nuclear\npower. It was what we had grown into. It was the next step of steam. It\u2019s\ndestiny.\nThe\nlibrary I read in was one of few with real books. Paper was a luxury. Most\nbooks were printed on flimsy pastic sheets (do not fold, spindle, or mutilate\nthe pages herein).\nBut\nI came then to a realization. I would not kill Hitler on my next trip. In\nfact, killing people in the past seemed to be almost impossible as the\nuniverse would replace the individual and his effects throughout the world at\nlarge. No, what I had to do was to divert the person\u2019s impact on society.\nAnd the person I chose was the man who created the steam car that caught the\nworld\u2019s fancy. It was this way I would make the world a better place.\nAbner\nDoble created a marvelous piece of equipment that even in this world is still\nnoticed. His steam car\u2019s boiler could go from cold to ready in ninety\nseconds. It had marvelous efficiency. It could run on anything. But we ignored\nthe other gases and used the cheap stuff. It was us, the consumers and our\ncheap coal and wood that doomed the world in the name of cheap transportation.\nAnd we did it happily. We were proud of our achievements.\nThe\nmodel I have sitting on my desk looks a lot like Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and\nthat is such a bad comparison to make because a steamer was ten times the car.\nIt was smooth, powerful, and quiet. I miss them. I miss the hiss of traffic\nand the ability to really handle a car like it should be handled.\nBut\nto make the world a better place I paid a man called Mr. Edwin M. Daugherty a\nsmall brick of gold to refuse Mr. Doble\u2019s company the request to offer more\nstock. Mr. Daugherty was the Commissioner of Corporations in Los Angeles and he\nhad the power to say something like that.\nI\nhad been tired. Instead of trying to kill Hitler one last time I\u2019d crossed\nocean and continent to California to crash Mr. Doble\u2019s dream of the steam\ncar.\nWhen the Doble Steam Motor Company collapsed, steam cars were doomed. Without\nmore stock, they couldn\u2019t raise the money to build more cars, and Doble\nwould disappear as a company. It was such a little thing to do, to shake Mr.\nDaugherty\u2019s hand and change the world.\nThe\nnext few days I sat in a tiny restaurants and read the papers until I began to\nsee the signs of trouble. The stock\u2019s price fluctuated, and then even more\nincredibly, shot up as manipulators took it for a ride, then discarded it. And\nDoble collapsed.\nThe\nwarehouse I came up to the future in was empty. There were no scientists or\nhissing time machines, only dusty large pallets. And I was here, here in this\nworld of gas powered cars. The middle east was not a backward group of nations\nbut world powers! Planes powered by gas! Everything by gas. And there are\nforests. Trees that make my heart skip with happiness. London: only mildly cold and rainy, with fog. It wasn\u2019t snowing anymore.\nI hear people complain about\npetrol and how horrible it is to the environment. But you haven\u2019t destroyed\nall the forests like we did. You\u2019ve done less damage than you could have.\nLate at night in my small\nroom over the bookstore listening to the hum of cars outside I think about the\ntime machine and why it disappeared in this timeline. Everything has a reason.\nMaybe, when things get really bad we create a time machine out of desperation\nand return to fix the point where we went wrong. Maybe somewhere there are\nscientists working on a device. And when this world gets it wrong they\u2019ll go\nback to a point and fix it. Yes, these thoughts do keep me up at night. But I\ntell you, you really do live in the best of all possible worlds.\nI\nknow this is true, because I made it to be this way.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050903212707\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/janmar2001\/steam.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The Internet's Premier Magazine of Historical Science Fiction","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/cRWHBL6kVo9I9PkuZItcKvOfYKY.json","volume":2.0,"issues":1.0,"has_text":true}

For the first time in years,\nhis chest didnt hurt. Could you pour me a little whiskey?\nThe\nnurse looked horrified, but she poured a finger of whiskey into\na large tumbler. She stopped, looking at him.\nHe\nsmiled, and waved her on. She poured another three ounces into the\nglass and passed it to him.\nHe\ntook the glass and gazed at the amber contents for a moment, then\nslowly downed the lot of it. It burned pleasantly, with a bit more\nkick than was usual. But then it had been some days since he had\nhad any.\nHe\nhanded her the glass and said, This is funny.\nShe\ndidnt know if he was talking to her or to himself.\nHe\nlaid back into the pillows and closed his eyes.\n#\nWhen\nhe opened his eyes again, the room had changed. The curtains werent\ndingy and the bed didnt smell poorly. Antiseptic, rather.\nHe frowned. The room had most definitely changed he had been\nmoved. He must really have been out, because he had no recollection\nof being removed from the old bed, no memory of much of anything\nsince he had come to Glenwood.\nHe\nsat up and looked around. The room was very plain, with white walls\nand no decoration. There was a window to his left, pale yellow curtains\ndrawn but not keeping the sunshine out. There was a glass and pitcher\non the table beside his bed. He inspected the pitcher and the smell\nwas odd. He knew it though, from his childhood in Georgia. Orange.\nThe juice was from oranges.\nHe\npoured himself a glass and sat on the edge of the bed, thinking.\nHe thought he might like some whiskey, but he didnt have a\nyearning for it. It just might be nice. Looking down, he saw he\nwas dressed in some kind of pyjamas, not his old ones, and not any\nkind of material he was familiar with.\nHe\ndrank the orange juice and stood up. He felt wonderful. He took\na deep breath, and was disoriented when the wracking cough didnt\nhappen. He took several more breaths and waited. Nothing.\nHe\nfrowned again, but apart from not knowing where he was, he felt\nbetter than he had for years. He went to the door, and found it\nunlocked. He opened it, and peeking out, he saw a hallway, upstairs\nand open on the far side. It overlooked a massive sitting room below,\nand though largely undecorated, the house seemed to be a manor of\nthe style he had grown up with.\nHe\nwent back into the room and checked the closet. He found some trousers\nand a shirt that fit him nicely, but no shoes. Or weapons. He dressed.\nThe shirt was nice, silk, he suspected, but there wasnt a\ntie. The trousers had no suspenders, but there was some sort of\nmechanism in the waist for adjusting the tightness. It took him\na moment to get the hang of it. The floor was carpeted, but he still\nfelt naked without boots, or at least slippers.\nHe\ntook his juice and began exploring the house. The hallway led to\na stair, which took him down into the sitting room. It was comfortably,\nthough again, plainly furnished. There was a single bookshelf, on\nwhich rested three or four dozen books. Next to the shelf was a\ntable, on which rested an empty picture frame, and a flat board\nof with letters randomly scattered across it. A game, perhaps?\nHe\nleft the sitting room, following the main hall toward what looked\nlike a foyer. There were light jackets hanging, canes and parasols.\nIn a small closet he found several types of footwear, boots and\nothers.\nHe took a cane with a silver handle in the shape of a ravens\nhead.\nHe\ngrabbed some boots that looked likely and put them on. Better. And\nmore comfortable than anything his feet had ever felt. He opened\nthe main door and saw a respectable veranda, and fields of\nwhat?\nHemp.\nHe\nspun to his right, instinctively reaching for his shoulder holster,\nthen grinned foolishly at the woman reclining casually on the settee\non the porch.\nYou\nlooked like you were wondering about the crop.\nHe\nbowed deeply, I was indeed, maam. Do I have the pleasure\nof meeting the mistress of this estate?\nShe\nsmiled faintly, distractedly. You do. My name is Margaret\nAmbleside. Though Madge will do, Doctor.\nHe\nlooked her over. She was tall, he suspected, and dressed like a\nman, in a cotton work shirt and trousers. She went barefoot. She\nwas comely, if not beautiful, and briefly he thought of Kate. Well,\nthen, as I suspect you know who I am, and since you are likely responsible\nfor my transport to this lovely abode, I find myself quite at your\nservice.\nIndeed.\nShe turned back to looking out over the fields. Hemp has become\nthe largest, most lucrative crop since the turn of the century.\nIt is the cornerstone of my wealth.\nHe\nlooked out over the fields. Turn of the century? He knew hemp was\ngrown for rope, but how it could be responsible for wealth\nwas quite beyond him. Where was he? And who the hell was she?\nHe\nwas the most skillful gambler, and the nerviest, fastest, deadliest\nman with a six-gun I ever saw. Do you know who said that,\nDoctor?\nHe\ncoughed politely and sat in a nearby chair, Begging your pardon,\nmaam, Id be more interested in who they were talking\nabout.\nShe\nlaughed softly, and seemed to turn her attention to him fully for\nthe first time. Wyatt Earp said those words about you, Doctor.\nAt your funeral, I suspect, though I dont know for sure.\nWyatt\nalways liked the sound of his own voice, seldom as he used it. So,\nIm dead then, am I? Well, its been a long time coming.\nAnd since I doubt a man of my past could be in heaven, I must say\nhell is a might prettier than I suspected it would be. He\nknew now that he must be in a sanatorium, and speaking to a fellow\npatient. Of the touched kind, he thought wryly.\nShe\nlaughed again, No, you are not dead, my dear Doctor, though\nyou might find that easier to believe than what I have to tell you.\nCome, walk with me.\nSeeing\nlittle choice, he followed her into the yard, and around the estate.\nThe house was huge, a true plantation home, and as they walked,\nshe gave him the history of the place.\nThis\nis the first hemp plantation that was legally established in the\nUnited States since the 1970 act which effectively banned hemp production.\nThe government of the time didnt distinguish hemp from the\ndrug called marihuana, you see.\nHe\nnodded, and listened to her tale. Though most of the people he had\nassociated with could hardly be called rational, this\nwas the first time in his recollection that he had actually spoken\nwith a truly crazy person.\nIncidentally,\nwe are in Hawaii, a set of islands in the Pacific which became the\n50th state of the Union in 1959. This, as I said, was the first\nexperimental farm, and established in 1999. Hemp is legal again\nnow, and its production has largely saved the ongoing destruction\nof the worlds rain forests and reduced environmental pollution\nmore substantially then any other single factor of the 21st century.\nMy grandfather bought this farm, and managed to control a fifth\nof the worlds hemp in 15 years.\nThey\nrounded the house, finally. The back yard was well manicured and\npicnic tables were scattered about. A large gazebo stood in the\ncentre of the yard, and she led them toward it. As they climbed\nthe steps into the gazebo, he said, Quite a tale, Miss Madge.\nWhat year is it now?\n2212.\nAh.\nThey\nstood in silence, and he could see the ocean in the distance. He\ncouldnt hear it, but he caught a whiff of the sea air. I\ndo not mean to offend you, Miss Madge, but I dont actually\nbelieve you. You must know that.\nShe\nturned and smiled, Of course, Doctor. It is not important\nthat you believe me, anyway. Only that you get better.\nWell,\nto that, Miss, I do feel as right as rain. He frowned. As\na point of fact, I can say I havent felt this fine in years.\nI\nshouldnt wonder. For one thing you dont have TB any\nmore, and for another, you havent had a drink in over 300\nyears.\nHe\nstarted to chuckle at the last, then realized what she was saying.\nWhat do you mean by TB?\nTuberculosis,\nDoctor. Its gone. Youre cured.\nHe\ngrabbed her by the shoulders, leaning into her face in rage, You\nlie! It cant be cured, and you lie to a dying man!\nShe\ndidnt react to his rage, or his handling her, with anything\nmore than a raised eyebrow, and, Im not lying, Doctor.\nYou know Im not.\nHe\nreleased her, ashamed of laying hands on a woman. He turned away,\nand looked at the ocean. Go. Ive had enough words with\na crazy woman.\nShe\nlooked at his back for a moment, then walked away. In the yard,\nshe called back, Dinners at six.\n#\nThere\nwere no other people around that was the problem. If this\nwas a sanatorium, where were the doctors? And he felt better. Healthy.\nHe couldnt deny that. Maybe he was still sweating out a fever\nin Glenwood, delirious. Yes, that was it. He was delirious, and\nmaking up this ridiculous fantasy, because when it came right down\nto it, he was afraid to die. As much as people believed him fearless,\nreckless, even insane, he was afraid of death, and faced it every\nday, had since he learned he was dying some 14 years ago.\nOr\nwas it, what? Three hundred and some years? He chuckled, his rage\ngone. He walked along a path he had discovered that meandered its\nway toward the water. He suspected it would be quite a hike, but\nhe didnt really have any pressing items on his agenda.\nNine\ntimes he had been close to death, nine times he had cheated the\nold ghoul. Four near-hangings and five gunfights with bad odds.\nHed had his nine lives and then some. He was living on borrowed\ntime as it was. He wasnt sure what the doctors in Atlanta\nhad meant by a few months that they granted his life\nif he moved west, but he was reasonably sure it wasnt supposed\nto be 14 years.\nThe\nwoman knew Wyatt, or knew of him, at least. That thing she had said,\nit had sounded like something Wyatt would say\nhe shook his\nhead. If this was his fantasy, every detail like that would make\nsense. But his imagination was taking on political details that\nhe wasnt interested in, and more importantly, knew nothing\nabout.\nHis\nthoughts were interrupted as he crested a small hill and found a\ngraveyard.\nNow\nheres a fine thing.\nHe\nstrolled through the graveyard, looking at the stones, reading the\nnames. A chill overcame him. William H. Bonney, Billy the\nKid 1881. John Wesley Hardin, 1877. Jesse James, 1882. Harry\nLongabaugh, the Sundance Kid 1908. John King Fisher,\n1884. Ben Thompson, 1884.\nHe\nknew some of the names; others were unfamiliar, or worse\nafter his time. There were more stones, but he felt sick. Not in\nhis chest, but his stomach. He left the graveyard, and continued\nto the beach.\n#\nDid\nyou enjoy your stroll, Doctor?\nVery\nmuch, Miss Madge, thank you. I found the sea air particularly invigorating.\nMay I inquire as to the nature of that wonderful aroma?\nThat\nwould be dinner, Doctor. Well be having sea bass, with assorted\ngood things. Hungry?\nRavenous.\nShe\nled him into a dining room off the main room, where there was table\nbeautifully laid out, dinner in covered chafing dishes, and two\nbottles of wine open and breathing. She nodded to his place, Please,\nsit.\nHe\ndid and she poured them wine. She started dishing a serving out\nfor herself while he waited. She finished and emptied her glass\nof wine. Then she looked at him and grinned, If youre\nexpecting to be waited upon, youll have a long wait. Things\nare a bit different these days.\nHardly\nsurprising, miss. I suspect that things are more than a bit\ndifferent. May I? he picked up the bottle, refilling her glass\nas she nodded. I am not indifferent to speculations about\nthe future. I see the change about me, and I have read some of the\nflights of fantasy, such as those by Mr. Verne.\nHe\ntook a long drink, then refilled his own glass. I believe\nthat I have solved this little mystery, you see. This is a delirium,\nand I am very near death in my little room in Glenwood Springs.\nMy mind is taking me to places far removed from the reality of my\nsituation.\nShe\nnodded, You are very near death, but you arent delirious.\nI have taken you from the past, and I have administered the cure\nshe paused, noticing his glare. Then, Let us say for the moment\nthat you are near death, and leave it at that.\nHe\nnodded, Good then. Am I to suppose then, that after dinner,\nwe are to adjourn to the bedroom for some of the more\ncarnal\npleasures?\nShe\nspluttered into her wine. Wiping her chin, she said, Absolutely\nnot!\nYou\ndont wish to sleep with some of the most famous gunmen before\nthey\npass on?\nNo!\nShe was blushing furiously\nAh,\nwell, then my apologies.\nThey\nate for a while in an uncomfortable silence. Then, she said, After\nyour death, another man wrote some speculations about the\nfuture as you said. His name was H.G. Wells, and one of his\nnovels was called The Time Machine, published in 1895, in fact.\nI\njust missed it.\nShe\nfrowned, Yes, well, the story was about a man who could travel\nin time, into the future. Time travel is a reality, now, though\nit is strictly regulated by the government, and used only for research\npurposes.\nAm\nI a subject of your study?\nIn\na manner of speaking. Im a criminal however, and certainly\nnot licensed for time travel.\nAnd\nyou steal historical figures?\nShe\nnodded, And pieces.\nBut\nyou are obviously incredibly wealthy. Why have you followed a criminal\npath?\nShe\nshrugged, Why else? Boredom, the things money cant buy,\nbecause Im used to getting my way\nHe\ngrinned then, I understand completely, Miss.\nShe\ngrinned back, despite herself, I thought you might.\n#\nAfter\ndinner she took him into another room, a gallery of sorts, where\nher artefact collection was. She showed him a wealth of historical\ntreasures from all periods of the past, but the bulk of the collection\nfocused on the American West. She had an impressive collection of\nshooters. He paused over one of the display cases. Thats\nWyatts badge.\nShe\nnodded.\nMay\nI touch it?\nOf\ncourse. She opened the case and handed him the badge. It was\nin good condition, better, in fact than the last time hed\nseen it. Inexplicably, he could feel the weight of the years that\nlay between him and his friend as he held it. He gasped.\nCome.\nShe put the badge away, then led him back into the main sitting\nroom.\nShe\nsat him in a chair in front of the picture frame and letter game\nhe had seen earlier.\nOn,\nshe said.\nSuddenly,\nthe picture frame filled with light.\nSearch\ninput, John Henry Doc Holliday. End input.\nThe\nscreen flashed, and a disembodied voice said, 12,469 hits.\nA list of writing appeared on the screen, and he gasped as he saw\nhis name, often followed by the dates of his life.\nNarrow\nsearch input, association with Wyatt Earp, 1886. End input.\n142\nhits.\nMatch\nOne.\nThe\ncomputer read off the article, listing the events of Wyatt and Docs\nlife in that year. Text flashed on the screen, and pictures. Docs\nhead spun.\nShe\nexplained how to use the tool, You can ask it anything, its\nvery intuitive. If there is anything it doesnt understand\nthrough your drawl, she laughed, you can type it in\nwith the keyboard. She indicated what he had thought to be\na game. He nodded.\nShe\nasked him, Have you ever seen a typewriter? He shook\nhis head and she said, Thats curious then. What a strange\nway for you to arrange the letters in your delusion.\nHe\nhad to agree. She yawned, We are connected with every other\nhouse-hold, government office, library, and university in the world.\nMy system has access to all but the most classified information.\nKnock yourself out Im going to bed.\n#\nHe\nwas still in front of the computer when she came down in the morning.\nHe had adapted to the tool quickly a large holographic image\nwas being projected into the centre of the room, showing the illustrated\ntimeline of the colonization of the solar system, and the major\nexisting trade routes.\nWell?\nHe\nwas wild around the eyes, This is the most elaborate fantasy\nI have ever had. I wonder if they gave me laudanum.\nShe\nlaughed, Ill start breakfast.\nHe\ncame into the kitchen as she was retrieving bacon and eggs from\nstasis. What do you want with me?\nShe\ndidnt look at him, Im going to kill you.\nHe\nnodded, Why?\nBecause,\nthere are better shooters than me Annie Oakley for one. But\nthere are no better gunfighters. And Im going to prove it.\nI\nsee.\nAnd\nyoure dead anyway, so Im giving you a little gift, a\nglimpse at what your world will become.\nI\nwont draw on a woman.\nShe\nturned around then, grinning wryly, Thats what the rest\nsaid, too. Look into my eyes.\nHe\ndid.\nIf\nyou dont draw, I will kill you anyway.\nHe\nbelieved her.\nWell,\nthen, maam, Im your huckleberry.\nThey\ndidnt say anything during breakfast, but afterward he went\nto the gallery, to her guns, and picked two Colt army revolvers.\nAnd a knife, because it made him feel better. He holstered one Colt\nat his shoulder, and came back to the kitchen.\nMiss\nMadge, wheres the ammunition?\n#\nAs\nhe fired at a picnic table he had stood on end for a target, he\nmused. Last night on the computer, he had seen what the world had\nbecome, and his decision that he was delusional had begun to fall\napart. There was just too much information for a delusion, even\nthe delusion of a man of his imagination. He had watched the progress\nof the United States, in films taken by the Temporal Historical\nAgency. He was starting to believe that he was actually in the future.\nAnd that he was cured of tuberculosis.\nBut\nnow, he was going to have a gunfight, with a woman. A crazy woman,\nbut not crazy in the way he thought. What if he lost?\nMuch\nof Docs success in the past was due, he suspected, to the\nfact that he was living on borrowed time. If he died in a gunfight,\nso much the better. He never wanted to die sick in bed, with his\nboots off. Fate had a sick sense of humour, if that was his doom.\nNo matter how tricky the situation, no matter how drunk he had been,\nhe had always made it through, only to die in ignoble sickness,\ndeserted by friend and lover.\nBut\nhe wasnt sick anymore. His hand shook as he lined up his next\nshot. He had a chance of a life, a real life here. Not under any\nsentence of death. Would he die in a gunfight three hundred years\nafter his death, now that he didnt want to?\nHe\nthought of Kate, and Wyatt. What would they think of this world?\nWyatt would just laugh at his amazement the Marshall was\nan eminently practical man, and doubtless would go about getting\nthem jobs. But Kate would be entranced. Maybe they could build a\nlife, a real life in this place. The woman Madge had some device,\nsome means of travel, obviously. Maybe he could find it, if his\nluck hadnt finally run out.\nEven\ncats only got nine lives was he luckier than a cat? He resolved\nto land on his feet this time. He steadied his hand and fired.\nThe\nshot went wide.\n#\nMiss\nMadge, are you ready?\nShe\nnodded as she strapped a S&W Schofield to her hip, Are\nyou?\nI\nam. Do you have a firing range, or some other theatre where youd\nlike to stage this production?\nYou\ndont have to be snide, Doctor. You were dying, after all.\nYes,\nmaam, but I am not now, and that is bitter medicine. Do you\nthink me a coward, Miss Madge?\nNo,\nDoctor, I dont. In fact, I regret this. I have come to like\nyou in the past couple of days. But I have to know.\nHe\nshook his head, I hate to disappoint you, maam, but\nyou cant know now for sure.\nWhat\ndo you mean? She was distressed.\nI\nwas always under a sentence of death, condemned by the foremost\nmen of medicine of my time. My ability to survive was dependent\non my lack of concern about death. I was living on borrowed time,\nand I was deeply in debt. I am no longer dying, and as such, I cannot\nfight with the reckless abandon of my youth.\nShe\nfrowned, but didnt say anything.\nSo,\neven if you beat me, you wont have beat me at my best, and\nyou will have not answered your self-imposed test satisfactorily.\nThey\nstared at each other, there in the parlour. The showdown had begun,\nand Doc thought, you could hear a pin drop in this quiet.\nShe\nglared at him, then said, Youre a bastard.\nHe\nnodded, I was not born with that distinction, but many people\nhave speculated that I may have earned it. Shall we be friends now?\nHe turned away from her and started for the door. Perhaps\nwe could have a drink, and watch the hemp grow.\nAs\nhe walked, she said, No. If thats the way you want it,\nthen so be it. She went to the desk and said, Security\nsystem on. In the event of gunfire, kill Doc Holliday.\nAs\nthe implication of her words sunk in, he heard the familiar click\nfrom behind him. He was going to die, regardless.\nHe\nturned, rage moving his hand despite his brains screaming\nwarning. Bitch, he snarled, firing.\nBefore\nshe could squeeze, his shot hit her in the hip, and her shot went\nthrough the window. His second took her in the chest, the S&W\nskittering across the floor.\nHe\nhad his second gun out he had no idea what the security measures\nmight be in this house and time, but he was prepared. When nothing\nhappened, he calmed himself, and went to her side. She was alive.\nBe\nstill, he said, Where are your medical supplies?\nShe\nshook her head. No.\nMiss\nMadge, I must insist that you do not let your pride kill you. There\nis no security system, is there?\nShe\ngrinned, Yes, there is, but it needs a password.\nHe\nfrowned, not understanding, but he gathered that she didnt\ngive it a password. Will you let me help you?\nIm\nnot hurt, to prove this, she sat up, apart from a couple\nof good bruises. And my pride.\nI\nsee. Through the tear in her shirt, he caught a metallic glint.\nWhat now?\nI\nthought I could beat you. But I wasnt willing to die to prove\nit. With you or the others what if I won, but you wounded\nme, or even killed me? It would be a hollow victory, then.\nShe paused. You were always my favourite, Doc. Lets\ngo have a drink and watch the hemp grow.\nHe\ngrinned down at her. Perhaps he had made it to heaven after all.\nLead the way, Miss Madge. Lead the way.\"\nBack to top","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20041128094100\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/aprjun2002\/dentist.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/SJcL9HywcG348XFOHTjsEK8Dxvk.json","volume":3.0,"issues":1.0,"has_text":true}

Oh, how I miss you - your strong smile, your firm hand on my shoulder. My invincible older brother. Yet you died just a few days ago from the same hot fever that burns through me now like a wildfire in summer. Don't worry. I kept my promise. Though I think it would have been better for us if I had not. Fate has come full circle. A fate that, until now, I knew nothing about.\n* * *\nIt started a month ago not far from our village, below a bluff where the Coos River greets the ocean. Knee deep in the cold, numbing water, I used a stone to drive the last birch stick into the muddy river's bottom to complete the weir, a submerged fence of stakes and lattice, rock and mud. Soon the tide would rise and the fence would guide the fish into a shallow pool. They'd be trapped there until the waters receded. Then the harvest would begin.\nI stared at my reflection in the water. A thirteen-year-old man stared back with brown eyes, distinguished features, clear skin and black, coarse hair, tinged red by the summer's sun. \"It's been a good year, Bright Eyes,\" I told myself.\nMy elder brother, Strong Heart, heard me and laughed.\nI glanced at him.\nHe grinned his approval from the shore, fixing me with his strong eyes. The wind swept his long black hair back, revealing the old scar beneath his left eye. Five years my senior, he was several inches taller than me, with broad shoulders and defined muscles. We shared everything else in common, though. Our eyes, hair and skin tone looked the same. He was a bigger and older version of me.\n\"It'll be some time until the tide recedes,\" he said, giving me a hand as I stepped up onto the bank.\nI rubbed my tingling legs, numbed by the icy water, and nodded. A seagull cried overhead as I sat down and slipped one foot tenderly into the matrix of woven grass within my bear-hide moccasin.\n\"I saw a cave up there.\" He used his lower lip, jutting it out, pointing up the hill. \"It must have been uncovered when the ground shook yesterday.\"\nGetting to my feet, I shook my head no.\nHe started up the hill anyway, ignoring me as he sometimes did. I followed obediently behind, bounding up the jumbles of rock and boulders that covered the otherwise barren slope. A few times I slipped, my legs growing numb again as gusts of wind raced across them. But before long I saw the mouth of the cave. Jagged incisors of rock growled as the cold wind swept through them.\nStanding there in one place, I began to shiver, goose bumps covering my body, my skin tinged blue - my mask of strength broken. Embarrassed, I didn't hesitate when my brother entered the cave. I followed him inside.\nThe cave opened up into a large chamber. Shadows hid much of its jagged ceiling and walls. More 'teeth' jutted through the dirt floor, making it difficult to walk in the dim light. I turned, following my brother and then stopped.\nAn enormous egg, the size of a hut, lay on its side in the middle of the cave's dirt floor. But it wasn't brown or any other color. Like the calm waters of the weir pool, its smooth surface reflected my image and that of my brother.\nI screamed.\nStrong Heart smirked, reached out, and touched it.\nI gasped.\nIgnoring me, he ran his hand across its surface. Nothing happened.\nStepping cautiously, I came beside him and felt its surface myself. Cold and damp, smooth like an egg without crack or crevice but hard.\nMy brother pounded on it with his fist and it made a deep sound like thunder.\nSolid as a rock, I thought. My eyes grew wide. \"What animal laid this?\"\nStrong Heart laughed. \"Steel,\" he said reassuringly. \"The white man makes it.\" He walked behind it. I followed him, not wanting to be very far away. On its far side, its maker had cut a smooth triangle into its thick shell, creating a doorway the size of a man. A steel hut, I thought. \"Don't go inside!\"\nHe turned and grinned at me. Stepping further into the twilight of the cave, something caught his foot and he fell.\n\"Are you OK?\" I asked.\nHe sat up and began poking at the dirt. After a few seconds he turned towards me, raising a human skull in one hand. Setting it aside, he began to dig. \"Help me! The white man might have burial treasure here.\"\nI stood firm. It was wrong to desecrate this place. It held black magic. I watched and said nothing.\nHe pulled something else up.\nI thought I recognized it. \"Is that a short fire stick, like the one the fur trader has?\"\nHe nodded. \"You mean a pistol. Let me show you.\" My brother wrapped a hand around it and squeezed. The gun roared and lit up the cave with a flash of blue light as it pushed my brother's hand back into his face.\nI cried out, my ears ringing. Then I saw my brother slumped on the floor. I scrambled to him. A large welt grew where the gun had struck. I shook him, but he remained asleep. What could I do? I looked from him to the gun. Only one thought came to mind. Father would know what to do. As the village shaman he could break the gun's curse. I picked up the gun. It felt cold to the touch, like the icy river. Grimacing, I slipped it beneath my waistband and grabbed my brother.\nI had managed to carry and drag my brother as far as the weir pool. Three men in a canoe saw me and helped bring him to the village. The village stood high on a hill to escape the seasonal river floods. A grove of trees sheltered it from the wind.\nWe carried him past a couple of wooden huts to the gathering place in center of the village. Sitting on vertebrae taken from a beached whale last summer, a few older men tended the large fire pit. Nearby some young girls surrounded a pile of beads, rings and bracelets. One of them tossed two plum seeds, scorched black and etched with stars and quarter moons on either side.\n\"Strong Heart is hurt!\" I cried.\nAll heads turned and they saw us carrying him. The old men went to my family's hut to prepare my brother's bed. The girls ran to the berry patch to get my mother, discarding their wagers.\nEntering my family's hut, we laid him down on a mat of woven reeds. My mother came to his side, out of breath. Worry creased the lines on her face. She flashed me a look and I left the hut. Outside my father waited.\nStern brown eyes met my gaze. He was heavier than I, with graying hair, and patchy brown skin. Thin lines of charcoal tattoos ran the length of his back, elbows, and ankles, medicine to ward off back pain. But in every other way we looked the same. He was an older and wiser version of me.\nTaking a deep breath, I handed him the gun.\nHe turned it over and asked, \"where did you find this?\"\n\"In a cave, near a skeleton. There was a hut...\"\nHe shook his head. \"This thing should have stayed there. It's cursed. Your brother would have known.\"\n\"He wouldn't wake.\"\nMy father rubbed his chin. \"You've disturbed its dead owner.\"\nI nodded, feigning that I understood the implication he was making.\n\"You need to return it.\"\nI shook my head. \"But Strong Heart is ill\u2026\"\n\"Alone.\" He fixed me with a stare from behind folds of sun-etched skin. \"You do this alone.\"\n\"But he found it!\"\n\"Bright Eyes, you took it!\" he said, swatting my nose with a forefinger.\nI bowed my head, feeling my lower lip tremble. I bit it to keep from crying.\nHe raised his hands and walked away. \"Don't blame me. The Great Owl has said it is so.\"\nI stood, watching my father leave. I couldn't go back there. It would be low tide soon. I'd miss the harvest. And it would be dark in the cave. What if I told him about the steel hut in the cave? I started to follow him when I heard a sound. \"Psst!\"\nI turned.\nIt was the fur trader, beckoning me with a finger. Or did he mean someone else? I looked around but saw no one.\nHe made some more sounds in his language, which ended in a fit of coughing.\nI walked towards him. Like many white men he was covered from head to foot with filthy cloths; his face was shrouded in hair except for the area around his nose and eyes. His ears protruded though his hair like the nubs of a deer that recently lost its horns, only lower. And his eyes were red and moist. A breeze carried his scent of urine and filth to me. I pinched my nose and took a step back.\nHe pointed to the gun, turned, and pointed towards his moving hut just outside the village. I didn't understand, but I followed him to his camp. Upon reaching it, he sneezed, wiped the back of his hand across his nose, and pointed to the gun. Then he grabbed a bear fur from the back of his moving hut and shook it.\nI looked down, appalled. I needed to return the gun to the cave to break the curse.\nHe grunted, sneezed again, and pulled a white man's woven shirt like the one he wore and shook it.\nFinally, I understood. He was a white man. He could break the curse. I looked at the mountain again. Long shadows of the late afternoon had started to run across it. I shivered.\nThe man hacked and spat out some phlegm, tinged red. He pointed once more to the gun and then to the non-fur shirt.\nI nodded and made the exchange.\nI heard people shouting from my home. I ran up the dirt trail and pushed through the crowded entryway. People gave way, and I slipped inside my family's wooden hut. I found my brother awake, hugging my crying mother. I smiled. The curse was broken. No, I had broken the curse. My first spell. My father would be proud.\nArriving at the weir, I could see my father and village men at the shallow pool. The tide had retreated back to the ocean, leaving the fish stranded. I took my position next to my father. Thrusting a three-pronged spear into the water, I impaled a fish and flung it ashore.\nMy father cleared his throat and then spoke. \"Strong Heart is awake.\"\nI nodded, turning to face him.\n\"And you returned the gun to the cave.\"\nI said nothing. Had I done the right thing?\nHe coughed and then smiled. \"Your magic is strong. You'll make a good shaman some day.\"\nI felt the corners of my mouth curl into a smile, unable to repress my happiness.\nHe coughed again, but this time more violently. His face became red and he had to sit down.\nI laid my spear aside. \"What's wrong?\"\nHe shook his head and clutched his chest. \"I feel weak. My chest hurts.\"\nThe curse! Perhaps my magic is not as strong as I thought. A couple of men helped me bring him back to the village.\nMy mother met us at the threshold of our hut. \"What happened?\"\nI looked at the ground. \"I don't know. He collapsed.\"\nMy mother, visibly worried, took my father in and laid him down next to Strong Heart.\nStrong Heart turned to her. \"It'll be all right.\" He winked at me and smiled.\nGuilt pierced me like a fishing spear. I turned and ran out of the hut. I had to find the fur trader. I ran up and down the deer trails, along the creek side, and over the bluffs above the ocean. But the fur trader had left. And my hope to end the curse left with him.\nFor three days my father burned hot, coughing up thick phlegm that turned pink and then red with blood. My brother and I ran baskets filled with river water to dowse him. But they didn't cool his burning spirit. He gripped his chest, acting as if an arrow or axe had pierced it. But the white man's curse, like an invisible arrow, left no mark on his body. He died.\nWe built a thatch platform near the river as Father had taught us. The village surrounded him, to show their respects. My brother lifted his body high upon the thatch platform while my father's best friend, Wise Fox, chanted the prayer to take him to the afterworld. Gazing into his eyes, I lit the thatch on fire. All during the song his gaze remained fixed, starring up at me, accusing me, asking me why. Tears streaked my face. I silently cried that night, knowing I had killed him.\nThe curse ran like wildfire through the village, killing many and weakening many more. The village became quiet. Old men no longer tended the fire and told stories. Young girls no longer giggled while gambling their beads, rings and bracelets. People stayed inside, living off their winter stores, surviving on berries and salted meats. A week later Wise Fox came and visited us. I noticed strange boils on his arms, black and hard.\n\"What is going to happen?\"\nHe smiled grimly and cleared his throat. \"It will pass.\"\n\"How can you be sure?\"\n\"When I was a young boy, not much older than you, perhaps fifty winters ago, a flood ripped through the village. Many died, including my mother and brother. But many more lived. My father told me that every generation has a trial, whether it is a windstorm, a flood, a drought, a fire, a famine, or even a curse. He told me that hundreds of years ago the Great Owl stopped the first trial, a curse, by painting a white star in the sky with a long wispy tail. Since the curse has returned, so will the star. But we must remain strong until then.\" He began coughing and sat back. We thanked him for the last time. He retreated out of our hut. I never saw him again.\nAfter three days the curse attacked Mother but this time it left its marks. Painful bumps the size of acorns appeared on her neck and armpits. They kept her up most of the night. By morning we found the marks had grown to the size of duck eggs and turned black and hard. Her spirit burned hot.\nMy brother and I left the village, carrying her down to the river. We waited on her day and night, submersing her in the weir pool to calm her spirit. But every day her pain grew. Dark blisters and purple blotches formed on her skin and spread to cover most of her body. Her body shook violently at times, leaving her tired and delirious. She resisted longer than Father, taking over a week to die.\nBut her death was peaceful. Cradled in my brother's arms, she sat in the weir pool, watching the sun set over the ocean one last time before the life left her. He held her that way all night, praying to the Great Owl and searching the sky for His star. But the curse remained.\nThe next day we built another thatch platform on the ashes of our Father as he had taught us. Come evening we were ready. But this time only the two of us appeared for the funeral. Most of the tribe was dead and those who survived hid in their huts, awaiting the curse. My brother gently lifted her body onto the platform and stepped back, tears streaming down his face. I waited with the torch. But my brother didn't speak the chant.\nAfter a few moments I said, \"Brother, chant the prayer that tells her spirit about the path to the Great Owl.\"\nMy brother shook his head, tears streaming down his face. \"Father never taught me the words.\"\nI was shocked. \"Then get someone from the village.\"\nHis voice cracked. \"They're all gone. Father, Wise Fox, and all the other shamans are gone. No one knows the sacred prayers.\"\nMy mouth dropped open. \"What does that mean?\"\n\"I don't know.\" He stifled a cough.\n\"What happens if I die? How will I find the afterworld? Will I lose my way on the trail?\"\n\"I don't think so. I can't see how the Great Owl would allow this to happen. His star should come soon.\"\nBut I knew His star wouldn't come because I didn't return the gun to the cave. I started to cry.\nMy brother placed a firm hand on my shoulder. He helped me to light the thatch. I watched as my mother burned, her gaze fixed on me.\nI turned away. \"You don't understand.\"\nConcern crossed his face.\nI couldn't hold it in any longer. \"Brother, I took the gun from the cave. Father said it was cursed and told me to put it back. But I didn't. I was scared. The fur trader gave me the shirt I'm wearing for it. I thought it would end the curse. But later that day Father fell ill. I tried to find the fur trader, but he had already left.\"\nI couldn't read my brother's expression. He stared at me for several moments, his face a mask of stone. Finally he spoke. \"The white man tricked you and lied to the Great Owl?\"\nA huge weight lifted off my chest. I never thought of that. Of course! That was it! The white man had planned this. The fur trader knew the curse would remain. I nodded. \"Yes!\"\nMy brother coughed. His eyes blazed red and moist. \"Do you remember the steel hut in the cave? Do you think it holds other guns?\"\nI nodded.\n\"Tomorrow we will find those guns and set out east to avenge our people.\" He coughed again. \"Sleep well. Tomorrow you'll need your strength.\"\nI awoke early, stepped outside, and stretched. A thick ground fog covered the village. Only the roofs of the huts peeked through, appearing as a field of thatched platforms, shadows of my people. \"Brother, it's time,\" I called back into the hut.\nMy brother appeared beside me. I turned to face him. He leaned against the entrance wall, hunched over, his hands under his armpits, face flushed, damp with sweat. I saw the curse's marks on his neck, bumps the size of eggs, surrounded by the dark blisters and dark purple marks.\nStraightening up, he smiled, reading the worry on my face. \"It's OK little brother.\"\n\"I'll go alone,\" I said, coughing.\nHis eyes became firm, resolute. For one last time he passed in front of me, leading the way to the mountain and the cave. He made it as far as the weir, collapsing on the ground, unconscious. The walk had sapped all his strength. I carried him to the pool, where we had cared for Mother. I held him in the waters and cried as the life left his body.\nI remembered our walks and adventures about the weir. I remembered when he winked at me after I brought my father to the hut. I remembered how gently he lifted my mother on the thatch and how he cried because he didn't know the chant.\n\"I will avenge us, my brother. I promise. Many white men will die.\" I peered up at the cave. Carefully, I propped him up in the weir pool so that his eyes were fixed open, starring at the cave. \"When I emerge from there, I will have the answer.\" I bowed my head and promised the Great Owl that I would stay in the cave until I found a way to avenge our people or I would die.\nSlowly I climbed the mountain and entered the cave with the white man's steel hut, shaped like an egg. At the mouth of the cave I rested, feeling winded. The sickness had started in me. I could feel it. I closed my eyes and felt the wind tug at my hair. I dreamed it was my mother. The thought soothed my soul and gave me strength. Getting up, I entered the cave and walked around the steel hut.\nI saw the skull my brother had found. Spitting at it, I kicked it aside, cursing its owner for killing my people. Looking up, I saw the opening, a triangular hole the height of a man in the thick reflective skin of the steel hut. The outer edges were smooth. A pale red light I hadn't noticed last time shone on the cave's dirt floor in front of the opening.\nI hesitated only for a moment before slipping inside. Despite having no windows and only one door, an eerie red twilight filled the hut, revealing its steel walls, ceiling and floor. The hut was bare except for a steel seat placed in its center. It faced the back wall and had a thin, flat steel back and sides to support its owner's back and arms. Lights like stars twinkled on the far wall, which looked bumpy like a gnarled cypress. Undecipherable white man's hieroglyphics covered the top part of the wall - 'Timeshifter 3295.'\nEnchanted, I stepped in front of the seat and ran a hand across the gnarled surface. Some of the bumps flattened and changed color. Then suddenly the hut lit up like midday. I heard a roar like a howling wind. I looked around but saw nothing. Fighting my fear, I stayed in the hut, ready to confront whatever demon I had awakened.\nThe hut lurched and I lost my footing. Tumbling through the air, I hit my head against the back of the steel seat.\nI awoke to water hitting my face. Salt water poured in through the hut's opening above me as I lay with my back on the far wall, which was now the floor. I stood up in the frigid water. What had happened? I imagined the steel hut rolling down the hill and into the ocean. Already the water had risen to my knees. The back of the steel seat was above me, fixed to what was once the floor. I used it like a tree branch and pulled myself up. Standing up, I examined the opening above me. I grasped the lip of the opening and fought my way through.\nThen I was out, submerged. Beneath me the hut fell away. It slowly sank deeper to the distant ocean floor below. I knew, like the gun, I would never retrieve it. I failed you, my brother. I found no guns. I cannot avenge you. A trail of air bubbles rose from the opening of the steel hut as it sank. I followed them to the surface.\nBreaching the surface, I gasped. It was a moonless night. But a bright star with a white trail lit up the sky. The star! It had finally returned. But it came too late for my brother, too late for my people.\nI cried. The Great Owl was cruel. Alone I would have to live, knowing my disobedience killed my people.\nUnder the light of the Great Owl's star, I saw the silhouette of land. Odd peaks, sharp and tall pierced the night sky. Although I knew the coast for many days' journey north and south of the village, I recognized none of it. Where had the steel hut taken me?\nI thought of my brother resting in the weir pool and made a new vow. Before I die I will return to you, my brother. I will find you on the river and build you a thatch platform, burn your body, and free your soul. The thought gave me focus, gave me hope.\nFloating on my back, I watched the bright star and its wispy tail as I swam toward shore. By the time I reached land, dawn approached, and the star had disappeared. Crawling out of the surf, I collapsed on the beach.\nI awoke, the sun warming my back. I felt tired and my head ached. I opened my eyes and sat up with a start. The sand wasn't gray and streaked with black as it should be. Instead, white sand covered the beach nestled beneath sharp peaks of white crumbling rock. I spun around, but found I was alone.\nThe beach stretched endlessly in both directions. I expected that the currents had dragged the steel hut to the south. After noting the position of the sun, I walked to the cliff to check the moss and determine where the sun crossed the sky. Heaps of rotten food and refuse littered the base of the cliff. Something glinted in one of the heaps. I extracted a round basket with a flat bottom, tapering to a tube-like opening. Smooth, clear, and hard, it smelled of fermented berries. I tested its strength against the stone cliff. Its end shattered. I ran a finger across the ragged end and dropped it. The jagged edge had cut my finger like an obsidian arrowhead. On the ground I saw a white man's paper with more hieroglyphics: 'At the beginning of October, in the year of the incarnation of the Son of God 1347...'\nI stepped back and surveyed the heaps of trash strewn along the cliff. What did it mean?\nThis was white man's trash, I told myself. Then I understood.\nThe steel hut had returned home, back to the land of the white man. Another curse. More black magic. The thought made me sick and I doubled over, vomiting on the sand. I wrapped my arms around my sides and one of my fingers brushed a bump, shooting pain across my chest. I forced myself to look. Lifting my arm, I could see two blisters the size of acorns forming beneath my armpit. My eyes burned with tears. Despite the star, the curse still plagued me.\nI raised a fist to the sky and yelled, \"Great Owl, why have You done this? Why did You lie to me about the star?\" I heaved again on the beach and pain shot through my legs, causing me to drop to my knees. I fought the pain and fixed my gaze to the sky. \"You've killed my family, my people, and taken me to a strange land to die. Why?\"\nAs an answer, the fire in my spirit erupted and I collapsed, passing out on the beach.\nWhen I awoke again, I found myself on a soft bed, covered with the same woven cloths that the fur trader had given me. A white woman sitting near the bed smiled at me. She didn't know me, so why was she smiling? I tried to get up but she pushed me back down, speaking cooing words in her language that I didn't understand. I felt weak all over and couldn't fight her. She fed me and tried to nurse me back to health. But of course, the curse prevented that.\nFor days I passed in and out of consciousness. In my dreams I remembered you, my brother, our family, our village. My mind wandered through the happy times, the times before we entered the cave. Often I thought I was there. I would cry out, calling for you. And you would come.\nOne time I awoke, calling for Mother. I found myself packed in snow with the white woman peering down at me, stroking my black hair. I closed my eyes and imagined it was Mother. It made me smile and that caused the woman to cry, breaking the illusion. I wished she would stop. How I missed you! I longed to be lost in the dreams again.\nThen she coughed.\nMy eyes snapped open. I could see the mark of the curse on her neck.\nSuddenly, I understood my fate.\n* * *\nI will never reemerge from the cave and see your face again, my brother. The steel hut brought me to a place before and far away, to a time of the first curse in the land of the white man.\nOur people were spared the first trial, but they were not. The curse that they gave us, I give to them now, completing the circle. The star I saw last night was the first star and the last as promised by the Great Owl.\nI know in a hundred years or maybe even more, I'll see you again, we'll enter the cave and begin the cycle anew. Perhaps it is I that have found the path to the Great Owl. Perhaps I am the one that started the great cycle. Somehow this warms my heart, brother, though I don't know why. Perhaps now that I know the revenge has come full circle, I can trust the White Owl again. But I'm too tired to think.\nI smile, remembering you now. Wait for me, my brother. It won't be long before I join you and the Great Owl. We'll start the circle anew together.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20051003193024\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/janmar2002\/thecave.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The Internet's Premier Magazine of Historical Science Fiction","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/qxp0LUYnn3UGAXJSl-dTa+sniuw.json","volume":3.0,"issues":1.0,"has_text":true}

He was a\nquiet fellow, and he kept pretty much to himself. This quiet nature\nwas very misleading though, as most of his enemies found out, usually\na little too late. He was a man who simply wanted to be left alone,\nand left to his own. Unfortunately, most of the strangers that drifted\nthrough our part of the country didnt see this as an option,\nand figured Blue Jim to be an easy target.\nThere\nwere many strange things about Blue Jim. He didnt talk much,\nfor instance. Then there was the fact that he never went to church,\nbut as I said, he had the minister out to his place on occasion.\nUsually, the minister who visited Blue Jims place wasnt\nquite himself for the next few days, not talking, hardly eating.\nHe always looked pale after coming back from Jims ranch, and\nhis lips would have a shade of blue to them for a few days.\nNo\nmatter how many times he was asked (which wasnt very often,\nreally), the minister wouldnt say what had happened, or what\nhed seen or heard while visiting Blue Jims place. Probably\njust as well, since it was no ones business.\nThe\ntime of year was rolling toward the cold season, and the leaves\nwere turning their browns and reds and yellows, and beginning to\npile up all over the town common. Old Man Jones had died the previous\nspring, and there wasnt anyone else who wanted to keep the\nleaves and tumbleweeds out of the main street, as it was a full-time\njob since our small town is surrounded by large maple and oak trees.\nWe liked our town to look as good as possible, and thats why\nwe hired Jake Sikes.\nJake\nwas a drifter, following the promise of gold from town to town,\nbut when he got to our town, he was almost dead with thirst. Seems\nthat his horses got loose somehow and then left him and his wife\nstranded, way back on the trail. They crawled into town and fell\nface-first into a horse-watering trough near the livery. We all\nthought they were going to die, but they pulled through after a\nfew long days.\nOnce\nthey'd both was recovered, Jake said he and his wife would be heading\non unless he could find some work around, and thats when the\ntown committee hired him to replace Old Man Jones. Jake was to be\nour new street sweeper. His wife came to work with me at the general\nstore, and everything was fine. She was a religious woman, always\ntalking of how the Good Lord sent her and Jake to us, how the Good\nLord would always watch over His own. Although she didn't work very\nhard, she was company on those long, cold winter days, and that\nwas worth the pay even if I did have to listen to how good the Lord\nwas.\nAnyway,\nJake was a good hand at work. He stayed busy most of the time painting\nthe old, scrubby buildings that made up our main street, sweeping\nand raking the leaves and debris, and repairing broken hitching\nrails, boardwalks, and keeping the water well cleared. He worked\nhard, and stayed out of the way, and thats just how we liked\nit. He was a good man, and we thought we were lucky to have him\naround.\nOn\nthe morning of a blisteringly cold Thursday in late November, Blue\nJim came striding into town bundled up in his buckskin coat and\nthose long cowhide boots he always wore. They were scuffed so badly\nthat the original color couldnt be guessed and were now a\nfaded, sickly gray. Id tried to sell him a new pair of boots\nwhen he first moved to the area, but he just smiled and shook his\nhead. Guess a man will wear what hes comfortable with, and\nleave it at that.\nOn\nthis freezing Thursday morning Jake was in front of the general\nstore repairing a few loose planks on the boardwalk, taking his\ntime, enjoying the work and the brisk weather as he smoked one cigarette\nafter another. He glanced up as Blue Jim walked by, and his face\nfroze, an expression of unconcealed hatred storming his features.\nBlue Jim hurried into the store and closed the door behind him,\nshutting out the wind, and headed straight for the shelves of supplies.\nHes all business when he comes to town, no lollygagging for\nhim.\nLo,\nJim, I said over my coffee. The store was empty except for\nJim, myself and Susan, Jake's wife, and Id probably not get\nanother customer all day as cold as it was. I took another cup from\nunder the counter and filled it with steaming brew. I noticed that\nSusan practically ran to the storeroom when Jim walked in, but I\ndidn't think much about it to be honest. Women are strange folks,\nand who can tell what's on their mind?\nAfter\na few minutes, Blue Jim strolled over and put his shopping on the\ncounter, and, taking the offered cup, seated himself across from\nme. I went back to reading my month-old paper (mail only comes once\na month or so from back East), knowing that trying to talk to Blue\nJim would do no good. Id heard him speak only once since he\ncame to live here, and that was when he told Sheriff Jacobs his\nname, and that hed filed a homestead where his farm is now.\nI remember his voice: deep, smooth, and thoughtful. Strained, somehow,\ncome to think of it.\nWhen\nhe spoke, I was so surprised that I actually thought I had imagined\nit, and just kept on reading my paper.\nMr.\nTalbot, he repeated in his strange voice.\nI\nlooked up with evident surprise in my eyes, my mouth hanging open.\nSomething\naround his eyes arrested me, caused me to take a few steps backwards.\nI bumped my head into the shelves of lamp oil behind me, bringing\ntears of pain to my eyes.\nIm\nsorry, I didnt mean to spook you. I need to ask a favor of\nyou. Those eyes, those radiant, arresting eyes! I still remember\nthe vivid greenness of his eyes to this day.\nI\nheard myself saying Sure, whatever you need, Jim, but\nit didnt sound like my voice at all. It sounded childish,\ntinny, and seemed to come from far, far away.\nHe\nsmiled, and I swear I saw the biggest, whitest teeth Ive ever\nseen on anything, on any person or animal, that Ive ever seen\nin my life. Something in that quick smile told me not to worry about\nthe teeth, but not to mention them either. I never did, not to another\nsoul, until right now. I have no doubt that those teeth were razor\nsharp, could probably shred a man in minutes, bones and all.\nI\nwould like for you to tell the gentleman working on the boardwalk\noutside to stay away from my ranch.\nA\ngunslinger came through town a few years back, and had the misfortune\nof bumping into Blue Jim outside the only saloon weve got.\nNow, that gunslinger was widely known, and feared by every man I\nknew. He was a wildcat, rattlesnake and the devil rolled into one,\nbig as a bear and twice as mean.\nThe\ngunslinger had been drinking most of the afternoon, and was just\nleaving when he stumbled out the door and into Blue Jim. The supplies\nJim was carrying fell to the ground, and so did the gunslinger.\nBlue Jim didnt even budge. I saw it all; I was right behind\nJim, heading to the saloon after closing up the store after hed\nleft with his purchases. Without a word, Jim bends down and picks\nup his things, and starts to step around the fallen gunslinger.\nJim\nhad taken no more than a single step when the gent jumps up and\nknocks his things back to the ground. Wherere ya goin,\nboy? Seem in a mighty hurry, you do. Phaps youll show\nsome respect and apologize for hittin me before I shove this\npistol down your throat.\nBlue\nJim tried to step around the man again, but before he could a gun\nwas in the gunslingers hand, shoved against Jims stomach.\nThe hammer cocked back, and I swear Ive never seen fury in\na mans eyes like I did that day. I dont doubt that the\ngunslinger meant to kill Jim right then and there, but before he\nhad time to pull the trigger, a hand shot out and grabbed him around\nthe throat. I heard a snap, and then the gunslingers body\nhit the dirt, twitching. Blue Jim picked up his things, walked around\nthe dead man, and went on his way, never looking back.\nSo,\nwhen Jim told me to pass along to Jake to stay away from his ranch,\nI knew what would happen if he didnt: wed never see\nJake alive again, not hide nor hair.\nYes,\nSir, Ill do that, Jim. I felt like a man in a daze,\nor perhaps a waking dream.\nWith\na nod of his head, he downed the last of the coffee, scribbled his\nname in the IOU ledger, and walked out.\nSuddenly,\nI felt weak in the knees, and my whole body started shaking. I felt\nthe blood run down from my face, and when I looked in the mirror\nhanging against the far wall, I was as pale as the minister was\nafter visiting Jim at his ranch, and my lips had a slight blue tinge\nto them. From somewhere inside me, an icy wind began to blow, chilling\nmy blood.\nIn\nthe dying light of the day, I watched Blue Jim turn toward his ranch\nand trot his big mare without another word. The weakness in my knees\nwas so strong that I had to sit on a barstool for almost fifteen\nminutes before I could trust myself to stand.\nOutside\nmy door, Jake watched Blue Jim as well, and even from where I sat,\nI could see trouble crawling all over the younger mans face.\nI would have to pass on Blue Jims warning, and soon.\nSusan\npeeked out from the storeroom door, and when she saw Blue Jim was\ngone, she came back out and poured herself a cup of coffee. She\nspilled it all over her hand as she tried to drink it, they were\nshaking so bad.\n\"What's\nthe matter, Missus Sikes?\" I asked.\nShe\nlooked at me like I was the one acting all strange and said: \"Didn't\nyou notice? That man's got no soul. Empty eyes, Mr. Talbot, dead\nempty eyes!\"\nSighing,\nI wobbled over to the door, and creaked it open just a bit. Now\nyou listen to me, Jake. You dont want to go messin with\nthat man. Jake turned to stare at me, a sneer on his face.\nIm telling you, Jake, for your own good. Hes a\nman that just wants to be left alone, and youd be well to\nsteer well clear of him.\nJake\nturned back to stare toward Blue Jims ranch, and he spat into\nthe wind. Sure, Pops, Ill leave him alone.\nI\nlooked down at Jake for a moment longer, knowing that I was surely\nlooking at a dead man. The wind picked up, and I went back inside\nthe store for another cup of coffee and a shot of whiskey.\nI\nnever saw Jake again after that.\nWell,\nI never saw him alive anyway.\nSomething\nhappened that night that Ill never forget. I woke up in my\nbed, covered in sweat, freezing down in my bones. I could have sworn\nsomeone was in the room with me, but I knew I was alone. I kept\nan oil lamp burning all night, most times, because I like to read\nat night when I cant sleep. It wasnt very bright, but\nit cast enough light for me to see into the corners of my small\nbedroom in back of the general store.\nThe\nlast images of a nightmare swept through my mind, and I shuddered\nagainst the whistling wind outside, snuggling deeper into my covers,\nglad that Id left the lamp burning.\nI\nwas just about to fall asleep again when the most hair-raising scream\nyou could imagine jolted me fully awake. That scream sounded like\na mans very soul was being ripped out and burned right in\nfront of his eyes.\nThough\nI had only heard that voice twice before, I knew without a doubt\nwho it belonged to: Blue Jim Davis.\nAs\nthat wailing, horrible scream died away, someone started pounding\non the front door of the store. A few yells and more than a few\nswears reached my ears from the street, and I hurried through the\nstore, turning up the lamp as I went.\nThe\nsheriff and minister were running past the store toward the livery\nwhen I ran outside, stumbling through the door in my bare feet.\nWhats\ngoing on? Sheriff, whats happening? Do you-\nThe\nsheriff didnt give me time to finish, just grabbed me by the\narm, and practically dragged me to the livery with him. I distinctly\nremember the minister praying even as he ran past us, his face beaded\nwith sweat though the temperature was close to freezing.\nOnce\nat the livery, the sheriff shoved a shotgun into my arms, and pushed\nme out the door in front of him, swearing the whole time that Id\nnot live to see tomorrow if I didnt get my butt moving. I\ngot my butt moving as fast as I could, being more afraid that the\nsheriff would run me over than thinking hed actually kill\nme. He practically threw me up on the horse that was waiting in\nthe first livery stall, smacked it across the bottom, and away I\nwent, following the minister, the sheriff right behind me and gaining\nfast, heading straight for Blue Jims ranch.\nAnother\nagonizing, soul-wrenching cry split the night, and I almost fell\noff the horse from fright.\nThe\nsheriff was the first one of us to get to Blue Jims ranch,\nand just as he pulled his big stallion to a halt, the house burst\ninto flames. Shards of glass flew all around, and the sound of the\nraging fire almost drove me deaf. Another scream ripped the night,\nand Sheriff Jacobs tried to reign in his horse a little too hard.\nThe big stallion reared up on its hind legs, toppled backwards and\nlanded on top of him.\nThe\nsheriff didnt even have time to scream; the big horse crushed\nhim in an instant.\nThe\nminister was behind him, and his horse reared up as well. The old\nman hung on, and after a few seconds, the horse dropped back down\nagain. The minister jumped off the animal, paying no attention at\nall to the sheriff, pulled me off my own horse, and ran straight\ninto the barn from where the last scream had come from, dragging\nme with him.\nTogether,\nwithout slowing down, we entered the blackness of the barn.\nThe\nsmell almost drove me out of my mind. As soon as I stepped into\nthe barn, the minister lit a lamp, and another. The stench of blood\nwas so strong that I tasted bile. My eyes were watering, and for\na minute I couldnt see or think of anything but getting out\nof the barn where I could breathe. Horses that were in the barn\nstalls were whinnying madly, white eyes rolling, hot breath blowing\ntheir fear all around the dark, stinking barn.\nI\nturned, and ran straight into a support pole. It smashed into my\nface, and I dropped to the ground, the gun thudding dully as it\nhit the hard-packed dirt of the barn beside me\nThe\ngun, you old fool, the minister screamed from somewhere behind\nme.\nI\npicked up the gun, looked up, and passed out.\nI\ncouldnt have been out long, because the minister was still\nslapping me when I came to.\nI\nwas so stunned at the sight that greeted my eyes that I couldnt\npossibly move an inch of my body. Or maybe it was the cold that\nhad seeped into my old bones.\nStanding\nat the far end of the barn was Blue Jim, his stomach ripped open,\nblood gushing out of it. Something long and slender from the inside\nof his stomach looked as if it were pulling the skin tight, somehow\nresealing the wound from the inside. His left leg was twisted at\nan odd angle, and as I watched, the other leg popped around the\nsame way and Jim took a few steps forward seemingly without pain,\nas if it was perfectly natural for knees to bent backwards instead\nof forward. One of his eyes was hanging on his cheek, rolling around\nsickeningly. I'd swear I part of another eye - a glowing blue one\n- behind his empty socket. His clothes looked burned in places,\nbut clean and fresh in others. Chunks of his hair were missing where\nit looked to have been torn out by the handfuls.\nHis\nhands, my god, his hands! He had his hands stretched out before\nhim, and they were glowing, but what surprised me even more was\nthere weren't any fingers - just a long, blunt stub with three or\nfour tentacles dancing about the ends of it. A soft blue light swirled\naround these tentacles, and he threw this stuff, this blue light,\nacross the barn. I didnt see what it hit, but I heard it.\nJake\nscreamed from the darkness of horse stall, screamed until I thought\nmy head would explode. The softly glowing blue that had erupted\nfrom Jims hands was now illuminating the entire barn, and\nstill the tormented wail of agony continued. Beside me, the old\nminister was down on his knees, his eyes tightly closed, his hands\nraised skyward. He was praying, I guess. Didnt do any good\nthough, because next thing I saw was a horse thundering from the\nstall where the scream had come from, its fine white hair\nburning a soft blue color, blue flames also shooting out its\nmouth and nose.\nThe\nburning horse ran straight over the minister and out the door. The\nold man was dead, had to be, and now I was alone in here with these\ntwo demons from Hell.\nI\nsat down in a heap, and vomited all over myself and the smashed\nand broken body of the old minister, my eyes never leaving Blue\nJim.\nJim\nbegan to say some strange words then, words in a language I didnt\nrecognize. His eyes began to glow bright blue, and his hands were\nmoving in a strange circular pattern. His voice was getting louder,\nand his hands were moving faster, when from out of the horse stall\ncame a long-bladed knife. It went straight into Jims throat,\nand another of those ungodly screams tore throughout the night.\nJims\nscream died away as he yanked the knife out of his throat and threw\nit right back into the stall. He staggered backward, and from the\ndarkness of the horse stall came a wet, gurgled burp and the thump\nof a body on straw Jake was dead, I knew it without a doubt.\nSuddenly,\na woman, Jake's wife I saw, appeared out of another horse stall\nto Jim's left, and ran straight at him. Her eyes looked wild, crazy,\nand she said something then that I didnt understand: Hezeh\nmedikiah mordrin!\nI\nsaw Blue Jim stumble backwards, dirt smeared all over his face,\nhands raised protectively in front of him. He howled back at the\nwoman, and swung his arms at her head.\nShe\nlunged at Jim then, fear and hatred I havent seen in a person\nbefore or since burning in her eyes. Jim tried to pull away, but\nthe woman held firm. \"In the name of the Almighty,\" she\nscreamed into his face, spittle flying, \"leave this place!\"\nShe threw her arms around him, and brought her mouth within an inch\nof his. Try as he might, Jim couldnt pull away.\nBlue\nJim was roaring like a lion caught in a trap and the woman was screaming\nat the top of her lungs, showering each other with spittle, blue\nsparks jumping between Jim and the woman.\nThe\nwoman was screaming about how the the Good Lord would prevail, how\nthe devil had no power here, but it wasn't affecting Jim at all.\nSuddenly Jim howled like a deranged, half-starved wolf and his mouth\nopened wider than should have been possible. His face peeled back\nfrom his head, shrinking and growing at the same time, growing from\nthe inside out. Within a few seconds his face was lying against\nthe back of his neck, and another head had grown out of his mouth.\nThose razor teeth lined the new mouth, raspy breath wheezing between\nthem. A single eye opened in the middle of this new head where its\nnose should have been.\nThis\nseemed to break the woman's faith, and she simply stood there, staring\nat the new face, staring at the blue eye looking back at her.\nFrom\nout of the womans mouth came a harsh yellow form, a smaller\nversion of the woman herself. I dont know how, but I knew\ninstinctively what was happening: Jim was trying to suck the woman's\nsoul right out of her body.\nThe\nyellow figure rushed from her mouth and into Jims. He stumbled\nbackwards, gagging and choking.\nBlue\nJim looked over at me, said something in that weird language again,\nand everything went black.\nWhen\nI came around, I was lying about a hundred yards from the barn,\nwhich was a roaring inferno, and Jim was just finishing up with\nthe remains of Jake. I say finishing up, but maybe I should explain\nwhat I saw.\nJim\nwas eating Jake. Those teeth I had seen earlier were indeed sharp\nenough to chew through bones, because they were doing it now. All\nthat was left of Jake was his eyeless head. I dont know what\nhappened to his eyes, and I dont want to think about it, either.\nI noticed that Jims wounds were all but closed already, and\nas I watched in horror, a gash on the side of his neck slowly closed\nwith a wet sucking sound.\nI\nscrambled to my feet, but Jims hand reached out lightning-quick,\nand pulled me back down again. That weird glow was pouring out of\nhis eyes now, eyes that looked savage and strangely empty. Hungry\neyes, starved eyes.\nI\nsat down again, whimpering, nauseous. The smell of blood was horrible,\nthe acrid smoke from the burning house and barn stinging my eyes.\nI looked around but couldnt see the old ministers body\nanywhere. Again, I dont know what became of it, and I dont\nwant to know, either.\nBlue\nJims hand shot out and grabbed mine, and pulled it to his\nmouth before I could react. His eyes blazed ever brighter for a\nsecond, and then faded a little. He looked down at my face and must\nhave seen that I was shaking with fear. \"Oh g-g-g-god,\"\nI whispered, \"don't hurt me, Blue Jim!\" He seemed undecided\nfor a moment, and I could almost hear the battle raging inside him.\nHere I was, another meal for this creature that had all but starved\nitself for who knows how long. He wanted to rip into my flesh, I\ncould see it in his face, and I could see his real face - the one\nwith scales all over it, just inside his mouth, pulsing and squirming.\nHe looked undecided for a second longer, then yanked my arm closer\nto his face.\nHe\nbit into my wrist with those razor-sharp teeth, and it hurt worse\nthan youd believe. I started to scream but the yell locked\nin my throat as images of a beautiful sky flashed across my eyes.\nA billion stars glided past my vision full of constellations that\nI had never seen. The images kept moving, the stars rushing past\nfaster and faster until I saw the stars I knew so well: Orion's\nBelt, the Big Dipper, Aries.\nSuddenly,\nJim pushed my arm away, and the visions died with it. I was lying\non the cold desert ground, softly crying.\nMy\nlips were trembling, and tears were pouring down my face. I was\nscared, more than Id ever been in my life. Wh, what\nare you, Jim? What are you really?\nI\nlooked over to see Blue Jim staring at me. He wasnt smiling,\nbut he wasnt frowning either. His eyes paled, and he just\nkept staring at me, and said nothing.\nWeariness\novercame me, and I faded off to a sleep filled with screaming women\nwith blue lips and razor-sharp teeth chasing me around an old, stinking\nbarn.\nWhen\nI awoke the next morning, Blue Jim was still sitting there beside\nme, looking about ten years younger. His face was the normal face\nof a man again, and there were no scars or cuts anywhere on him\nthat I could see. The farm had burned to the ground during the night,\nand the townsfolk were slowly making their way out to the ranch.\nNo one spoke a word as we buried what was left of our sheriff and\nJakes eyeless, bloody head. The good folks of the town helped\nme back to my bedroom in the back of the general store, and Blue\nJim followed. They never asked me what happened at Blue Jims\nranch, and I never told them. Ive never spoken of it at all\nuntil now, and Im only telling you because youll not\nbelieve a word of it anyway.\nThe\ntownsfolk elected Blue Jim as our new sheriff, and he took the job\nwithout a word. Pretty soon a traveling minister decided to settle\ndown in our town and start services back up in the church. Life\nresumed its normal routines, and every once in a while a drifter\nwould come to our town causing trouble. Almost every time we'd hear\na scream of terror during the night, and the next day the stranger\nwould be gone, never to be seen or heard from again. We didn't ask\nquestions, either; we figured Blue Jim was just doing his job.\nThats\njust the way the world was back then, people didnt ask questions\nthat they didnt want answered. Its a lesson youd\nbe best to learn, youngster.\nGuess\nyou know by know that Im the only person who ever escaped\nfrom Blue Jims wrath and lived to tell about it. Ill\ntell you one more thing, and then Im goin on to bed.\nIll\nnever be the same again, not after that night.\nAnd\nnow you know why my lips are always blue.\nBack\nto top","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20041128094100\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/aprjun2002\/toeachhisown.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/BByEA06gWX0FH2BKnUa2J-FTLg0.json","volume":3.0,"issues":1.0,"has_text":true}

The sewing circles, the hunting\nclubs, the women's auxiliary and everyone in the courthouse\nknew it. They all knew that there was just no way such a queer\nlittle gadget and toy shop could be successful in downtown\nPrattville, Alabama. The twentieth century had come but five\nyears ago and even so, a shop that seemed to carry mostly\nwatches, eyeglasses, fancy potato peelers and the like couldn't\nsurvive in the strict standards of the Prattville economy.\nMost people thought the shop was a poor idea to begin with\nand an idea that was destined to fail. A person only needed\nso many watches or potato peelers and the like.\nBesides the guarantee of failure, there was also quite a bit\nof ill-wishing for the fact that the shop was in a very nice\nspot. Main Street, just east of the cotton gin was a good\nspot. Most people thought there should be a new and better\ngeneral wares store. Some had talked of a clothing store being\nwell suited to the spot. Others wanted a new post office.\nBut all of this jealousy and ill-wishing wasn't the exact\nreason most people were suspect of the shop. Morris Dawson\nwas the real reason.\nMorris was a slight man, only five and a half feet tall in\nthick-soled shoes. His head was gleaming bald and he absolutely\nrefused to wear a hat. Thick round spectacles looked out at\nwhoever rung the doorbell entering his little shop and almost\nalways seemed to see a little more of the person than the\nperson might like. His appearance, though, wasn't the real\nreason he was so disliked. A rumor, perhaps true and perhaps\nnot, was that Morris Dawson was a Jew.\nHe didn't attend the First Baptist Church. He hadn't been\nin town long enough for Christmas to roll around and for that\nalone many were waiting. There was great speculation that\nwhen it did a funny little candlestick would popup in his\nwindow instead of a Christmas tree. Few people weren't quite\nso rude to ask a direct question, but Morris Dawson was given\nmore fresh ham, pork chops and sausage than any newcomer in\nthe city. There was this strange hope that if he either refused\nto eat it or that if he did eat it that his mouth would burn\nand smoke and then their suspicions would be confirmed. Often\nwas a ham sandwich seen lying beside his counter near lunch\ntime, but no one ever saw him take a bite. Among all the suspicion\nand rumor and speculation there was a stolid group of supporters\nfor his shop the Emporium Magnifica: the children.\nAny child who walked through the doors of the Emporium Magnifica\nwas instantly greeted with sights, smells and sounds of things\nbeyond their mind's imagining. Whirling gears, tinkling bells,\nshining crystals, sparkling lenses, the smell of brass polish,\nammonia - which wasn't altogether bad in small amounts - and\na strangely salty smell all greeted the children with fine\nhellos. It was a sensory experience.\nThe children always begged their parents for his music boxes,\nhis clocks, his colored glass balls that were far too big\nto be marbles or his other items that seemed to defy explanation.\nFew children could ever talk their parents into a purchase,\nbut many children managed to sneak a nickel of their allowances\nand chore money to buy something here and there. It was during\none of these covert purchasing visits that Sam Clayton found\nthe oddity that had become his heart's one desire gone from\nthe shelf of the Emporium Magnifica.\n\"A good and hot July afternoon to you Master Clayton,\"\nMr. Dawson said. He was always Mr. Dawson to the children\nafter he had once scandalized a mother by asking a child to\ncall him Morris.\nSkipping the frippery of small talk as many children do, Sam\nasked, \"Where did the blue glass ball with another ball\ninside it go Mr. Dawson?\" Mr. Dawson frowned with his\neyebrows and tisked.\n\"I'm afraid I sold that just this morning to a visitor\nfrom Montgomery. I take it you were fond of the Fondula Milgota?\"\nThat was yet another thing that the children loved about the\nEmporium Magnifica. Every single item, whether it was a comb\nwith wavy teeth for curling hair or a little brass monkey\nthat clapped nickels together had a special name.\n\"Yes sir, I like the Fondutti a lot,\" Sam remarked.\nHe knew he hadn't gotten the name right, but Mr. Dawson never\nmade light of it with any of the children.\n\"I tell you what, Master Clayton, I might have something\nspecial just for you. I'll even make you a deal on it. I'll\nsell this to you for the same price as the Fondula Milgota.\nSam brightened thinking of what wonderful item he was actually\nhaggling over. Of those children who were allowed to shop\nat Mr. Dawson's store, most were heavily forewarned not to\nlet Mr. Dawson talk them into giving more money for something\nthan they thought it was worth.\nMr. Dawson walked behind his tall glass display counter and\nbegan fumbling through boxes beneath it. Sam wondered what\nhe kept out of sight given the grandeur of what was within\nsight. When he brought out the item in question, though, Sam\nfelt his heart sink.\nMr. Dawson laid the item on the counter and unceremoniously\nblew dust from off of it. Sam had seen a compass before and\neven knew how to use one. This particular compass, aside from\nbeing made of brass and looking terribly old, was nothing\nspecial.\n\"I take by your look that you think you know what this\nis,\" Mr. Dawson said. A little half smile played at the\ncorner of his mouth.\n\"It's a compass,\" Sam said, feeling rather puffed\nat the breadth of his knowledge.\n\"In a way, yes it is. But in another way, it isn't. Show\nme how you would use it.\" Sam shrugged and picked up\nthe compass from off of the counter. Sam knew which way was\nnorth and thought that using this compass to find north would\nbe pointless. Instead of pointing north, which would have\nbeen pointing at the door to the Emporium Magnifica, the compass\nwas pointing at Mr. Dawson.\n\"It's broken,\" Sam said. As he said it, though,\nthe needle spun wildly and finally stopped, pointing at him.\n\"It's not a compass is it?\" Sam asked in a quiet\nvoice. Mr. Dawson let his half smile grow into a full warm\ngrin.\nPointing his finger to the sky and assuming a pose of sincere\ndeclamation, he said, \"The sky is green!\" The compass\nneedle spun so wildly that Sam could feel the whole thing\nbuzzing with it. When it stopped, the needle was pointing\nat Mr. Dawson. Sam smiled and thought he might know what the\nlittle compass did.\n\"My name is Fondutti Mygoda!\" Sam said to the compass.\nAgain the compass whirred and then stopped by pointing at\nhim. Sam cackled in laughter at the toy and then looked at\nMr. Dawson. \"You can't charge me the same for this as\nfor a glass ball. It's worth a lot more.\" The needle\nwas still.\n\"My dear Master Clayton, I told you that I would charge\nyou the same for this as for the Fondula Milgota and I intend\nto. If you wish to purchase it, then it costs you one nickel.\"\nSam actually looked at the needle to be sure. The needle was\nstill. Sam fished one of his two nickels from his pocket and\nhanded it across the counter. The other nickel had been a\nbackup in case Mr. Dawson changed his mind on the cost of\nthe Fondutti. Mr. Dawson took the nickel and rung the price\non his register. \"Then done is done. I hope you enjoy\nyour purchase Master Clayton, but I also hope you learn to\nuse it wisely.\" Sam didn't understand what Mr. Dawson\nmeant, but he nodded and smiled anyway. Sam pocketed the compass\nand left the Emporium Magnifica.\nOn the way back home, Sam ran into his friend David. David\nwas a year older than Sam at twelve, but he was still in the\nsame class as Sam and considered Sam a friend. David could\ntechnically hang out with older kids, but he often didn't\nand chose to hang out with Sam.\n\"Where ya been Sammy?\" David asked.\n\"Nowhere,\" Sam said as was the unofficial code for\nthe Emporium. A gleam entered David's eye and he grinned.\n\"What'd you get?\" Sam assumed the haughty pride\nof one who has glancing at one who has not.\n\"I dunno, maybe nothin'. Why do you wanna know?\"\nThis was, of course, all in a day's work of being a child\nwith something to lord over another child.\n\"Oh come on Sam! You gotta have somethin' good if you\nwent there! Just show it to me, just one peek.\" Sam slipped\nhis hand in his pocket and then looked around the quiet dirt\nroad they were standing on. He had no wish for anyone to see\nhis new purchase without first enduring the same treatment\nhe had given David. When David saw it was an old compass,\nthe elation slipped from his face like a stuttered stumble\non an icy pond.\n\"A compass? That's it?\" For a moment, a clear and\nvery poignant moment, Sam considered telling David what it\ndid. Then, either by fate or by simple choice, Sam let David\ngo on thinking it was a compass.\n\"I bet you don't have one like it,\" Sam said. He\npocketed the compass with pomp. He could still lord this over\nDavid even if David didn't know the full truth.\n\"Sure I got a compass,\" David said. Sam felt the\ncompass buzzing in his pocket.\n\"No you don't. I bet you don't even know how to use one.\"\nDavid looked sullen and hurt at the accusation.\n\"I sure do! I'm gonna bring it and show you! I got a\ncompass that makes yours look old and stupid!\" David\nsaid as he left in a huff. The compass was buzzing until he\nhad left. Despite the little spat, Sam felt proud that he\nhad been the one with the upper hand.\nSam trotted on home, feeling full of himself and full of power\nfrom his new compass. He could ask people questions now and\nthey couldn't give him anything but the straight truth.\nWhen Sam got home, the sun was pushing its way towards dusk.\nTheir house on Poplar Street was covered in the golden light\nof near sunset. Sam walked up to the porch and sat down on\nthe steps. He still had enough light for getting his chores\ndone before his Dad came home from work. His dad worked at\nthe gin as a supervisor. He had a secretary and everything.\nSam pulled his compass out and gazed at its thin little wobbly\nneedle and brass casing. He wondered if he could polish it\nany more than it was, and if he should save up and get a case\nfor it or if he should put it up somewhere for safe keeping.\nThese thoughts and hundreds of others, all lazy and only on\nthe cusp of seriousness, rolled through his mind in the late\nafternoon. It was because of these thoughts and musings that\nSam failed to hear his mother come from around the porch to\nfind him gazing down at his compass.\n\"Sam?\" she asked. Sam jumped at the sound of her\nvoice breaking the late afternoon trance he had fallen into.\n\"Don't you have chores that need to be done?\" Sam\nstood and faced his mother.\n\"Yes ma'am, but I was just about to do them.\" The\nneedle spun wildly. \"That is I was getting ready to get\nready to do them.\" The needle was still. Sam didn't know\nwhat the difference between one and the other of his statements\nwas, but he felt a surprising satisfaction at keeping the\nneedle still.\n\"Well you should get to them while there's still daylight.\nYour father will be home soon and he won't like seeing your\nchores undone.\" The needle twitched, just barely, in\nhis hand. Sam looked down at it and considered it for a moment.\nHe couldn't imagine what had made the needle move or why,\nbut Sam had so far seen no reason to disbelieve it. What Sam\ndidn't know was that by looking down at his new possession,\nhe had given away his interest in it to someone else. \"What\ndo you have there Sam?\" Sam's stomach lurched at the\nthought of explaining his new toy.\n\"It's just a compass,\" Sam said. The needle spun,\nbut Sam had turned it over in his hand to cover the face.\n\"A compass, where'd you get a compass?\" Sam swallowed\nand realized there was no option but to lie. He had personally\noverheard her mother refer to Mr. Dawson as The Jew.\n\"I found it,\" he said with the needle whirring away.\n\"Did someone lose it? We might need to find whoever lost\nit. A lost compass is a sign of bad things. Where did you\nfind it?\" Sam tried to think of the most innocent place\nhe could have found such a thing. The needle had stopped spinning\nwhen she spoke.\n\"I found it out near the gin,\" he said. The needle\nstarted again but didn't increase in speed, but stayed a steady\nspin.\n\"Well, I suppose anybody could have lost it. Maybe it'll\nhelp you more than it helped them.\" The needle stopped\nat the first of her words, but it spun again at the last.\nHis mother turned and went back into the house. Sam was confused\nby the compass and its rules, but he was terribly glad that\nhe didn't have to talk about it anymore.\nSam went out back to get on his chores and to get his mind\noff his string of lies. Splitting, stacking and hauling wood\nwas goodly work hard enough to take one's mind off of just\nabout anything. Dusk was retreating and night was creeping\ninto the summer sky when Sam finished, but his father still\nhadn't come home. His father was almost always home before\nsix but if Sam judged the light right, it was closer on seven.\nSam went to pump and washed his hands and his head. When he\nwalked in the house, he found his mother looking out the window,\nher arms folded over her chest.\nShe wasn't a worrier, so to speak, but that single pose often\nindicated that she was indeed worried about something.\n\"Something wrong Momma?\" Sam asked. She turned as\nthe dazed concentration melted from her eyes.\n\"No, Sam, just wondering what's keeping your Daddy.\"\nWhen the needle buzzed in his pocket, Sam nearly jumped. Then,\nwhen the back door opened, Sam did jump. His father walked\nin and smiled at the both of them. Sam looked up at his mother\nthen and nearly said, \"See? He's fine. He just came home\na little late.\" The look in her eyes stopped him, though.\nIt was a look of sadness and regret mixed with a dull sense\nof hopelessness.\n\"Did somebody have an accident at the plant Dad?\"\nSam asked, hoping to break the silent tension. Men were always\nlosing fingers and hands and such due to carelessness.\n\"Yeah, Sam, there was an accident.\" The compass\nwhirred with an intensity Sam hadn't felt it take before.\n\"Who was hurt?\" Sam asked in a small voice. He knew\nsome of the men on his father's crew but his question wasn't\naimed to find out if any of them were hurt.\n\"Jimmy cut his hand again,\" his father said. Jimmy\nhad cut his hand last week but by the whirring of the compass,\nhe hadn't this evening.\n\"That's too bad,\" his mother said in a flat voice.\n\"How's your new secretary working out?\" Sam had\nheard of his father getting a secretary. He had been one of\nthe first in the gin to get one and it had been a big deal\nat the time.\n\"She's working out just fine,\" his father said in\na voice that held just the hint of a smile in it. More disconcerting\nthan his father's voice was the fact that the needle had come\nto a sudden clicking stop. The click was audible, but no one\nbut Sam seemed to notice it.\nDinner was a quiet one that evening and Sam was grateful.\nIf no one spoke, no one lied.\nThe next morning, as soon as his father had left for the gin,\nSam had dressed, eaten and left the house. Nothing slowed\nhis run back to the Emporium Magnifica. When he reached it\nthough, the shop hadn't opened. It was still a good half hour\nbefore it opened.\nSam peered in through the windows. Mr. Dawson was in the back\nand Sam tapped on the window to get his attention. The slight\nman smiled when he saw Sam and rushed to open the front door.\nIn the early morning hours, the shop seemed to be sleeping\nitself. No clocks chimed, no music boxes were playing and\nfew lights were on to dazzle through the colored glasses.\n\"And what can I do for you this fine morning Master Clayton?\"\nSam thrust the compass across the counter without saying a\nword. Mr. Dawson pursed his lips and nodded in understanding.\n\"I suppose it was a Magi's gift if there ever was one.\nI only give this compass to those I believe can handle it\nwisely, but not one person has ever failed to give it back.\"\nThe needle stayed deadly still during his speech and Mr. Dawson\nreached out for it. Before he could take it, Sam reached across\nand put his hand on it, covering the face.\n\"That's true and I know it is,\" Sam said looking\nat Mr. Dawson, \"but maybe I could be the first to keep\nit.\" He didn't know how he could keep such a wonderful\nand horrible thing without it driving him crazy, but even\nso, he could feel that the needle was still. Mr. Dawson smiled\nand reached under the counter. What he produced glittered\nin the dull early morning light. It was a solid brass case,\njust a little bigger than the compass itself.\n\"Maybe this will help you remember that often the lies\nof life are more common and comfortable than the truths. It's\na hard lesson to learn, but one that we all must, even if\nmost of us don't learn it so young.\" Sam reached into\nhis pocket and produced his spare nickel. Mr. Dawson put the\ncompass into the case and snapped it shut. \"Then done\nis done. I hope you enjoy your second purchase Master Clayton\nand now, perhaps, you will find its use more sparing.\"\nSam took the cased compass and slipped it into his pocket.\nHe nearly walked from the Emporium, but a hot and strangely\ndirect question seemed to bubble to his lips.\n\"What's its name Mr. Dawson?\" Mr. Dawson didn't\nskip a beat.\n\"That little device is called Vere Mentiri. In Latin\nthat roughly translates to 'True Lies'.\" Sam committed\nthe name, the real name that Mr. Dawson had said, to his memory.\nHe never called it by any other.\nThe\nEnd","source":"http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20051030150806\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/aprjun2003\/emporiummagnifica-truelies.htm","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/yxK4+jBeG+qWInzvx6aaXEZsfX0.json","volume":4.0,"issues":2.0,"has_text":true}

He held my future in his\nrotting, trembling hands, though neither of us knew it then.\nUntil my deputization just fifteen days ago, I had been\nflailing and floundering with the direction of my life like\na tired man in deep water. I left Kentucky years ago, traveling\nto Orleans and Illinois, searching for something more from\nlife, knowing I needed to do my part for my country. This\nnomadic life came hard on the heels of my defeat for the\nIllinois General Assembly, which in its turn followed the\nnightmare of the Black Hawk War. It was the summer of 1834,\nand I was twenty-five.\nI rode west, followed hard by spirits. Everywhere I looked,\nI could still see their faces -- not those of my political\nopponents, but those of the dying redskins. To be honest,\nI had no qualms about volunteering to help with the Indian\ntroubles in my adopted state of Illinois. I was elected\ncaptain of my company, though we did little fighting, and\nmy men reminded me to duck to avoid making such a large\ntarget. I would respond that, despite my height, I was too\nthin to hit.\nThe sudden appearance of Chief Black Hawk leading his hungry\npeople across the Mississippi back to their ancestral lands\nnear Rock Island to plant their corn created a panic. The\nIndians were driven by the militia into Wisconsin and slaughtered\nlike wild animals. I could hear the gunshots in my head,\nas if my skull was empty and the bullets still reverberated\ninside it.\nSince that battle, I'd been rootless. As spring drifted\ninto summer, I again considered running again for the legislature.\nPart of me knew that if I brought in the killer with the\nstrange nickname, I would have an easier time of being elected.\nI pushed those prideful thoughts out of my head as I read\nabout the him, spreading madness and death across the Great\nPlains: he would enter a town in the morning, plant posters\nat noon, and perform in the evening. By midnight he was\ngone again, leaving most of the townspeople dead in his\nwake.\nI decided that my future in civil service could be put on\nhold until this madman could be stopped. I volunteered to\nbring in the disillusionist.\n# # #\nAccording to the stories of the survivors, the previous\nnight's show commenced at nine o'clock.\nDespite the late hour, all were welcome, including the children.\nEvery row of chairs in the town hall, which also doubled\nas the courtroom, was filled with expectant farm families\ndressed in their Sunday best. The town elders sat off to\nthe right, in the front row. The smell of hay and sweat\nwas reputed to not have been strong enough to squelch the\nodor of something rotten coming from the man standing at\nthe front of the hall.\nThe posters he had distributed had done their job, filling\nthe town hall long before the church bells sounded nine\ntimes. I myself had seen his posters, and I had to admit,\nthey were attractive, with their bright colors and elegant\ncalligraphy proclaiming his arrival, trumpeting his Feats\nof Truth.\n\"If you care not for the Truth,\" the man at the\nfront of the hall announced, a skeletal hand pointing at\nthe exit, \"if you care not for the dissolving of Lies\nand Illusions, I show you the door. You may leave now, if\nyou please.\"\nHe stood on the stage, arm still upraised and aimed at the\nexit. Not a single soul stirred from the chairs.\nThe witnesses described his performance as starting badly,\nand fast becoming painful to watch. His voice was so weak\nthat the entire audience spent the first half of the show\ncraning their necks closer to him. But the people of the\ntown rarely had entertainment, and they were willing to\nendure just about anything to take their minds off their\ncrops and their chores.\nForegoing any preamble, he asked for the mayor's watch and\nwithout pause, smashed it with a tiny hammer he pulled from\nhis sleeve. Shards of glass and metal flew as far as the\nthird row.\nThe man in black never tried to undo his damage. He simply\nheld up what was left of the watch, mostly springs and bits\nof metal, and then dropped it to the warped wooden floor,\nlooking at the audience as if to say, \"What were you\nexpecting? Magic?\"\nWhile the audience sat stunned, he continued his act. He\npulled a dead rabbit from his top hat and threw it behind\nhim onto the empty judge's desk. Setting the fouled hat\nback on his head, he pulled a mirror from his breast pocket\nand procured a thick golden coin in his right hand.\n\"Behold the magic doubloon,\" he whispered in a\nvoice similar to the pulling of bent nails. \"It goes\nup, yet never comes down. At least not where it is expected.\"\nWalking the coin down the cracked skin of his gray knuckles,\nhe held the mirror so it caught the light of the lanterns\non either side of the audience. He threw the coin high into\nthe air. Wiggling the mirror, he pulled an identical coin\nfrom the brim of his hat with a guilty brown grin.\n\"Presto,\" he hissed, even as the first coin dropped\nto the floor and rolled into the first row, where the mayor's\nwife squeaked as it touched her shoe. \"The mirror distracts,\nwhile a second coin is produced. What a Feat! How like magic\nit is!\"\nTwo teenaged boys from the middle of the crowd began to\nboo, and they gained confidence when no adults scolded them.\n\"Boo!\" they cried, though their voices broke when\nthe yellowed eyes of the man in black came to rest on them.\nOne of the survivors who sat near the front claimed that\nthe man's eyes gave off a smoky light as he stared the boys\ninto silence.\nI did not disbelieve such stories. I only reported what\nI heard; it was not my place to doubt the witnesses' testimony.\nIgnoring the interruption, the man continued talking in\nhis soft, raspy voice, as he performed more failed tricks.\nBy this time, more of the audience was beginning to boo\nand hiss, careful to do so behind their hands or when the\nman at the front of the hall was not looking.\nFinally, the man in black held up both hands, silencing\nthe crowd. He bowed with a smile like a grimace, and then\nhe announced his final Feat of the evening. Sarcastic applause\nand cheers rippled through the crowd, but when he turned\nhis smoky gaze on them, every person in the hall fell silent.\nWhat followed was next to impossible for the survivors to\ndescribe.\nSome told of the way he threw all of his props into his\nslim pack, even his dead rabbit and the corpse of the broken\nwatch, and then faded from sight. Others described how his\nvoice grew louder and his eyes brighter as he talked about\nthe nature of Truth. How he claimed that every person, young\nor old, male or female, carried within them countless fabrications\nand falsehoods, created on a daily basis.\n\"And now, tonight, I'm taking them,\" he said.\n\"I'm taking each and every one of your lies. I leave\nyou with only...the Truth.\"\nThe effect was instantaneous. Removed of all falsehoods,\nfrom harmless fibs to long-hidden indiscretions and nasty\nsecrets, the people of the town turned on one another. Mrs.\nSmithfield saw the affairs of her husband as plain on his\nface as the wart on the tip of his right eyebrow. Janey\nRecker learned that Little Jim Fickling had meant to throw\nthat rock at her and split open her chin. Paul Wandrey discovered\nthat his best friend Matthew Tildmann had been selling him\nbad feed and overcharging him for it for decades.\nFriend attacked friend, husband on wife, wife on child.\nNo one in the audience was left unscathed as secret affairs,\nuntold grudges, simmering hatreds, and so many more falsehoods\nwere stripped away by the whispering man in black.\n\"I am exactly what you see before you,\" he was\nreported to have said over and over again as he went through\npurses and pockets and coats, dodging swinging fists, booted\nfeet, and biting mouths. \"I would never lie to you\nabout who I am. For I am solely what you see, nothing more.\"\nHis pack stuffed full, he took the best horse from the mayor's\nstable and rode west out of town. The town hall's walls\nwere stained with blood, the chairs broken underfoot like\nso much kindling.\nThe disillusionist left no trace of himself, just the damage\nhe left behind.\n# # #\nI\nthought I knew this disillusionist, at least enough to understand\nhim.\nHe thought of himself as a sort of truth artist, this\ndisillusionist.\nHe knew the magic words that could never be heard by the\nhuman ear, the words that cut through the falsities of our\nlives. He worked in piercing and dissecting lies in much\nthe same ways as a poet or a politician works in creating\nthem. The true irony of the disillusionist was that he himself\nwas a walking falsehood, half-man, half-corpse, alive only\nto spread death and harsh reality like a sweep of paint\nacross canvas.\nI knew him, and I would stop him, if only I could catch\nup to him. He was always a day ahead of me, always a town\nbeyond wherever I stopped. Nobody could say with any certainty\nwhere he had come from. There were rumors that he had pulled\nhimself from Lake Michigan during a lightning storm like\na drowned corpse, too dead to realize he was no longer alive,\nseeking revenge on the living for his own murder. Others\nclaimed he was a fallen priest who had seen firsthand, during\nhis own personal rapture, that the Bible was wrong, and\nthe knowledge had driven him mad. Still others claimed he\nwas half red-blooded shaman and half demon.\nI scoffed at such stories. I would discover the truth about\nthe disillusionist. His trail was filled with corpses, and\nI was learning his methods. In his methods I could see his\nweaknesses. It was only a matter of time before I caught\nup to him.\n# # #\nI\nfound them the next afternoon, their pockets and purses\nemptied and blood on their dress clothes. Only a very few\nbattered and torn spectators, eyes like war veterans, lived\nto tell me about the disillusionist's performance. Just\na handful of adults and most of the children of town, along\nwith the sick and elderly who could not make it to the showing.\nThe survivors. They told me all that had happened, their\neyes still wide and unbelieving.\n\"He cleaned us out, boy,\" a toothless old man\ntold me, shaking his cane toward the west, where he'd seen\nthe man leave town. \"Cleaned us out of our best people\nand all their valuables. Like a human tornado, he was. Damn\nhis face and curse his path.\"\n\"No need for such language, sir,\" I said, my own\nvoice rising to match his. \"Take heed of the Good Book\nand pray for help. And don't forget to lock your doors behind\nyou.\"\nI left the emptied town and rode west. I set out on his\ntrail, riding for another long week following his tracks\nuntil the night I finally caught up to him, at the start\nof another show.\n# # #\nThough I could have filled my ears with wax to protect myself\nfrom the sound of his uncompromising truths, I entered the\ntown hall with open ears and unfettered hearing. The strength\nof arm that I'd inherited from my father gave me the ability\nto hold myself back as the show unfolded in front of me\nlike a nightmare skit. Over and over I told myself that\nI would not fail. I was a man of the land, after all, and\na devout Baptist. I would not be stopped by lies, even as\nthe gunshots from the redskin massacre continued to echo\nin my mind.\nThe disillusionist was over halfway through his act. \"You\nsee before you a man cut in two,\" he cried from atop\nthe rickety stage, his angular, discolored face framed by\nhis black locks and curling sideburns. In his own way, he\nwas handsome under his dusty top hat. \"I harbor no\nillusions from you about this. I show you only the Truth.\"\nWith his final word, the man in the shiny black suit pulled\nhimself in half at the waist.\nThe audience was shocked into silence. I'd heard of this\ntrick before, not from the last town but from the survivors\nin the many towns to the east, but it still did not stop\nmy jaw from dropping like a drawbridge. I could feel the\ncoarse hairs of my beard on my neck, tickling my adam's\napple. Flecks of something dark fluttered to the floor in\nfront of the split disillusionist, fluttering slowly to\nthe floor like slow-moving moths, or scales from a snake.\nI closed my mouth when the man let go of his upper torso\nand set it back on his waist, straightening his vest to\nhide the separation. On the table in front of him sat his\nhat, turned upside down. Something with whiskers twittered\ninside of it, trying to distract the audience. He saw our\ninterest and laughed softly, like wheezing, and then his\neyes met mine.\nI felt my will being tested. I again saw the Indians trying\nto surrender as the guns of the militia blazed. The guns\nthat had never stopped going off in my head ever since that\nbattle. My own courage quailed as the sound buffeted my\nears, and I knew I was not the courageous soldier I thought\nI was. I was just a man holding a gun, standing far removed\nfrom the actual fighting. My destiny did not lie there.\nMy eyes felt hot with shame for myself and pity for the\ndying redskins. Gunshots echoed in the distance, growing\ncloser.\nThe man in the black suit, the disillusionist, stared at\nme. The rest of the audience was frozen.\n\"Who are you?\" he whispered, but the words did\nnot enter my ears. The man seemed to be inside my head,\nwhispering to my mind like a snake in a tree.\nAnd then I was released. My eyes fell shut, and when I opened\nthem again, my back was sore and a dead rabbit, a golden\ndoubloon, a broken watch, and a pack of smoking cards lay\nscattered on the makeshift stage in front of the disillusionist.\nI had been lost to the world for longer than a single blink\nof the eye.\nGuns roared again in my ears, and bullets hissed past my\njutting ears. At that moment I realized that I'd never asked\nwhat I was to do with the man once I'd caught up to him.\nI couldn't very well pull my pistol and stop him in the\nmiddle show, could I? Or should I, before it's too late?\n\"And now, instead of any further Feats of Truth,\"\nthe disillusionist mumbled, and the audience leaned forward,\n\"we will skip ahead to my final, and most prestigious\nFeat. I will need total silence from the audience please.\nNot a sound.\" His voice softened, losing volume, until\nall I could hear was a hypnotic whisper. \"Do not dare\neven to breathe. I want to show you all something. I want\nto acquaint each and every one of you with an old, old friend\nof mine. The Truth.\"\nThe mix of booing and snickering voices stopped at the sharp\nclarity of the man's voice. He waited until complete silence\nfell around us, his black eyes scanning the audience like\na surveyor. He gestured at himself like a man showing off\na new suit. \"Look at me. I am only an illusion.\"\nAs he spoke, I reached into my coat for my gun I'd been\ngiven at the start of my quest. My long arm moved as if\nit had been soaked in molasses. Each inch closer was a tiny\nvictory.\n\"I am not a man at all,\" the disillusionist continued.\n\"I am only here for you, to show you the error of your\nways. To show you the folly of your falsehoods.\"\nI could feel the cold metal of the gun, but my arm would\nnot move to pull it out of my coat. That voice. It felt\nso real, so honest, that I wanted to listen and believe.\n\"And now, tonight, I'm taking them,\" he said.\nHe inhaled with a long, wrenching sound. \"I'm taking\neach and every one of your lies. I leave you with only...the\nTruth.\"\nHe snapped his fingers, a hollow sound. The lanterns flickered\nand my ears popped, as if the pressure had changed suddenly\nin the barn. I saw myself, in that moment, lying in a pool\nof my own blood, next to an ornate balcony chair as an unknown,\nsomewhat homely woman sank to her knees in shock next to\nmy lifeless body. Though my head was filled with the roaring\naftermath of a gun's explosive force, I could hear a man\ncry out something in Latin far below me, followed by the\nsound of mad footsteps. And then the image was gone.\n\"Mary,\" I whispered, though the name meant nothing\nto me then. I knew no woman of that name, other than casual\nacquaintances. I realized that I was holding onto my chair\nwith both hands, barely able to stand even as the people\nin the hall fought like dogs with one another. The floor\nwas miles away from me.\nThe disillusionist stopped emptying the billfolds and purses\nof the raging audience members long enough to look directly\nat me with his lightless, yellowed gaze. His face was twisted\nin rage.\n\"Why does not the truth drive you mad?\" he hissed.\nThe people around him continued fighting, fingers in the\neyes of their neighbors, knees in the groins of family members.\nThe disillusionist stepped closer, the top half of his body\nshifting as if it would somehow slide off his pelvis and\nfall to the floor of the meeting hall.\nMy mouth was dry, and the sudden silence unnerved me. A\nmother and daughter rolled across the floor in front of\nme, screeching like hawks in mid-hunt. I opened my mouth\nto speak, closed it, and tried again. All I could think\nof was my defeats, in my run for office as well as the loss\nof my courage and innocence during the Black Hawk War.\nGunshots. Always more gunshots. And the Mississippi turned\nto blood.\nAnd then, when I thought I would never be able to speak\nagain, words filled my head like rain. As always, words\nhad been my salvation, whether I was telling a story down\nat the post office, or giving a speech about improving the\nquality of the rivers in Springfield, or exhorting the armed\nmen under my command to not lose faith. The words came to\nme and cleaned my vision of the harsh light of the disillusionist's\nintentions.\n\"I have been familiar with disappointments,\" I\nsaid, my voice a whisper to match the disillusionist, \"too\nfamiliar to be very much chagrined these days. And I hold\nno illusions. All I have is my own honesty. And my hopes\nfor the future.\"\nThe disillusionist looked long at me. His eyes were dead,\nlike the corpses we had buried on the eastern shore of the\nMississippi back in '32. And then he snapped his fingers\nagain, so hard that flesh fell from his bones. The sound\nechoed in the barn.\n\"You will not take me in,\" he said. \"I cannot\nbe captured.\"\n\"I will,\" I answered. The gun was out of my coat\nand pointed at the disillusionist. His snapping fingers\nand scratching voice could not touch me now. I knew the\ntruth and faced it willingly. \"And you shall. Sic Semper\nTyrannis,\" I added. Thus always to tyrants.\nIn the meantime, the townspeople were still doing their\ndamnedest to tear one another apart. I held the man in black\nin my sights, but I could not pull the trigger. I had vowed,\nat the resolution of the Black Hawk War, never to kill another\nman, regardless of his race or wrongdoings. Instead I pointed\nthe gun at the ceiling and pulled the trigger.\nThe explosion of the pistol broke the disillusionist's hold\nover the townspeople. Battered and bloody, they helped one\nanother to their feet, weeping now as their rage was overcome\nwith fear and disgust. They emptied the hall and ran off\ninto the night. I was left with the disillusionist and his\nbag of failed tricks. He gave me a cold smile.\n\"So the farmers and their pathetic families live for\nanother day. Do not think you can stop me from moving on\nand continuing my work. My art.\"\nI nodded at the blood on the chairs on either side of us.\n\"That is not what I would call art. I would call it\nmalice and cruelty.\" I walked closer to the man in\nblack. With each step he seemed to shrink, while I grew\ntaller. Or perhaps I simply imagined it all. I was, after\nall, taller than almost any other man I'd ever met. Uglier\ntoo, many have whispered, when they thought my big ears\nwere out of range.\n\"It is true art,\" the disillusionist said. \"True\nrealism. I give them the world, without the false tint of\nprevarication.\"\nThe money he had been clutching in his hands fell to the\nfloor along with more chunks of his rotten flesh. He backed\nup until he was at the far wall. He bent for his bag, but\nfroze in the act when I cocked the gun.\n\"We all need our illusions,\" I said, and stopped.\nMy breath caught in my chest as I thought of the slaughter\nof Indians all around me, and not just in the Black Hawk\nWar. I saw everything, all the injustices of our young country\nthat we visited on one another. The Negroes bent over in\nthe fields, the burning villages of the Indians, the unknowing\ntownspeople who had run off only moments earlier. We were\na cruel, cruel people.\n\"And you think you can change all that?\" the disillusionist\nsaid. I knew, in that moment, that he had seen the images\nflashing through my head as clearly as I had.\nI aimed the gun at the man's heart. It would be so simple,\nI thought. And it could end here.\nThe disillusionist, sensing his advantage, stepped closer,\nstill talking.\n\"You? You with your dreams and aspirations? Do you\nthink you could make amends to all that has gone before?\"\nHe paused and inhaled, exhaled loudly. \"I see the dreaming\nfuture -- the lie -- you have built for yourself, my gaunt,\nbearded deputy. Would you be our greatest leader and end\nall that?\"\nI lowered the gun. I saw him clearly now, his eyes dead\nlike the men under my command after the Blackhawk massacre,\nand I heard the fear in his voice mix with the gunfire in\nmy mind.\n\"I will try,\" I said. \"That is all any of\nus can do.\"\nThe disillusionist looked down at the gun, aimed at the\nfloor, as if disappointed. \"You won't kill me?\"\n\"I'm not sure,\" I said, pulling out the handcuffs\nI'd been given upon my deputization, \"that you can\nbe killed, friend.\"\nRaising his nearly fleshless wrists, the disillusionist focused his gaze on me. The sound of guns made me clamp\nmy jaw shut. \"Who are you?\"\nI stood up straighter and looked down at him, this half-dead\nman with his fancy mustache and bloody top hat. I heard\none final echo of gunfire, and then the guns fell silent.\nMy jaw relaxed. The eyes of the dead had finally closed\ninside my mind.\n\"Who I am,\" I said, \"does not matter.\"\nI wrapped the cuffs around the man's wrist, careful to avoid\ncontact with him. \"All that matters is that you will\nnot kill again.\"\nWith the snapping of the locks, I saw my future open up\nbefore me, free of false hopes and wrong-headed pride. There\nwould still be time to prepare a run for the General Assembly\nthis fall. As soon as I brought this creature in to justice,\nI would pursue my dreams until they were within my grasp,\nand I would succeed. Of that I had no illusions.","source":"http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20051030132526\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/julysept2003\/disillusionist.htm","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/iizw3UrdpHTM1pUdRWDcMa0DVao.json","volume":4.0,"issues":3.0,"has_text":true}

He could\nbarely hear the palace noise now; they celebrated the coming of 1683\nwithout him.\nThey\nhad refused to buy him a pony again. And he was already eleven!\nDespite his family's wealth, he was poor, poorer than a boyar's son.\nPerhaps even more so than that of a dvoryanin,\na simple nobleman. He had nothing above the basic: clothes on his\nback, food in his mouth and a bed on which to sleep. All the money\nwent to his brother Ivan, who by arrangement ruled with him.\nHe was of the same bloodline as Ivan, but he felt closer to\npoor nobles whose lot he shared.\nThe\nboyars hated Peter's mother. It's all because of the foreigners,\nPeter's teacher, Nikifor, kept\nsaying. His mother favored the foreigners, and that's why God was\npunishing Natalia Kirillovna Narishkina, giving all the power to Ivan\nand his mother, Miloslavskaya. Damn\nthem, Nikifor kept saying, those tobacco-smoking, naked-faced\nAntichrists. They lead mother Russia to ruin...\nPeter\nslowed down. Frost was biting his cheeks, and he missed his gloves.\nHe took another step, tripped over something, barely keeping\nhis balance, then steadied himself. A small black box was half-buried\nin the snow next to his red leather boots.\nHe picked it up,turned it over. Its make was unmistakably\nforeign, its design exotic. The other day a burning stone had fallen from the heaven and\nNikiforhad instinctively blamed the foreigners. Peter suspected\nIvan's foul play, however, and demanded an investigation. The\nsoldiers checked for miles around but found nothing but a deep hole in the\nground.\nThe\nsame day, Peter went to the tower at the far edge of the castle, where\nKonstantin the Librarian lived. He let Peter peer into a brass\ntube at the moon, then one by one, the visible planets and a tiny\nobject that circled Earth, Konstantin's so-called \"comet\".\nSomehow, Peter felt, they were connected. More\nso than the mysterious heavenly body, though, the tube, fascinated Peter.\nIts craftsmanship was exquisite.\nPeter\nliked the foreigners, though he'd only seen them from the distance.\nThey looked so unlike the stiff, boring Russians, and they laughed\nlike children, though he noted privately that they dressed strangely,\nsmelled a bit off, and were hideously ugly. It was their lot.\nNothing could be done about it. Poor bastards, he thought.\nIvan will expel them all soon.\nThe\nyoung Peter sat on his haunches, examining the find. The box was made\nfrom a shining material, obviously valuable, but not brass, silver or\ngold; instead it was a uniform ebony, adorned with gold and colored\nsymbols one side. He touched it. It made a small noise, and a girl in\na strange clothing appeared suddenly in the air, dancing. Her face was\nblue and intense searching eyes blinked in the middle of her forehead\nbehind a gauzy mist. Gypsy magic!\nPeter\nbacked away and fell on his bottom.\nHe wanted to scream, to call for his governess, Irina, but no\nsound came from his mouth. A minute later, assembling all his courage,\nhe tried to touch the mysterious woman, whose body floated,\ndiaphanous, in the chilling wind.\nHe moved his hand to her, but felt no resistance.\nIt simply passed through her body as if she were made of mist,\nthen she was gone. His\nheart beating, he turned the box over and over in his hands, looking\nfor a means of opening it, to make her reappear. It was light and warm\nto the touch. He saw symbols on the surface but they were not in\nRussian.\nHe\nbit his lip, and after an eternity standing in the gathering blue of a\ntwilight snowfall, he made up his stubborn mind. He wouldn't let Ivan\nexpel them. He'd exile Ivan instead and rule alone. He'd find a way,\nhire them, learn from them. Together, they would make Mother Russia\ngreat again. Peter took off his coat and wrapped the box in it.\nHe shivered as he saw Nikifor running toward him, with a\nworried-looking soldier in tow.\n\"Pyotr\nRomanov!\" Nikifor called on the top of his lungs, using the\nRussian pronunciation of the name. \"Dorogoi rebenok!\nPoor thing, you'll freeze!\"\nPeter\nignored Nikifor, looking up into the gray, misty canopy. He imagined\nfor a moment that somewhere out there, the comet made round after\nround on its ever-lowering trajectory, well above the dark clouds to\nGod knows where. From it somehow had fallen or stepped this marvelous\ndancing girl, and his soul suddenly became enveloped in the quest to\nfind her. He was in\nlove, but it was a miserable, wintry love, an unrequited search\nfor the impossibly perfect woman, glimpsed only for a moment. In\nthat moment his heart was broken.\nIndeed,\nhe never found her. Thirteen years passed, Ivan died and Peter\nbecame Tsar Imperator, the first Emperor of Russia, the role Ivan had\ncarved for himself. From then on his energy was consumed with\ngovernance. He held onto the shiny black box, but he could never open\nit again, no matter how he tried. For forty-two years, He searched for\nthe young dancing girl. One\nafter another, he commissioned master craftsmen to duplicate\nthe box, in the hopes that by copying its weight, material and\nsupposed mode of manufacture he might induce it to open of its own\naccord, offering him another glimpse of the strange, wonderful\ncreature.\nUpon\nhis death, he observed with a smile that he had built a magnificent\nempire to her memory, and committed himself to searching for her in\nthe afterworld.\nThe Tsars who followed took after Ivan. Slowly, the empire began to unravel, and like the comet, began its ever-lowering spiral toward doom. When disaster finally hit, though, few people took interest. Nizhny Novgorod was abroil with news of widespread uprisings, as Tsar Nicholas II's troops had attacked unarmed demonstrators in St. Peter's square. The constant threat and fear of foreigners could be felt as far as Berlin, and there was talk of shooting gypsies.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050906051005\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/octdec2000\/dancing.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"Mark Budman returns with another fine twist-at-the end short story, this one set in Peter Romanov's Russia.

It doubled him over,\narms wrapped around his stomach. Geoffrey grabbed Philip's\nshoulder. \u201cYou gonna make it?\u201d he asked, his voice full\nof concern -- and fear.\nNormally Geoffrey found these\nforays into the past exhilarating. He loved breathing\nair that smelled of birds and trees and earth instead\nof chemicals. He loved the taste of water fresh from\na spring. He caught his breath at the sight of a fox\nor a deer disappearing into the woods. But Philip\u2019s illness\nreminded him that this place was hostile, this time was\nwild and full of risks.\n\u201cYou can go to the clinic when\nwe get back,\u201d he said. \u201cGet some antibiotics.\u201d\nPhilip\u2019s cough subsided and he\ntook a few cautious breaths. He shook his head. \u201cThey\u2019d\ncatch us,\u201d he croaked. He took a swig of water from his\ncanteen. \u201cBring down the whole organization. For what?\nSo I can kill off some bacteria that are every bit as\nalive as the birds in your sack?\u201d He took another swig,\nstifling his cough.\nYou always were the true believer,\nPhilip, Geoffrey thought. If I\u2019m going to die for what\nI believe in, I hope it\u2019s quick. I don't have the courage\nto waste away like you. Geoffrey thought of bears and\nwolves and panthers, all of which still roamed this section\nof eighteenth-century North America. What a thing to\nsee before I die.\nWatching his partner carefully,\nGeoffrey grabbed his gun and slung it over one shoulder.\nHe picked up the bag of birds and slung it, more carefully,\nover the other. He could feel some of them moving as\nthe tranquilizer wore off. They needed to get back before\nthe birds woke up enough to do themselves harm.\nWith Philip following, Geoffrey\nmade his way back to the jump point. He touched the activator\non his belt and the portal lit up, glowing yellow and\ngreen among the trees.\n\u201cThere they are!\u201d shouted a muffled\nvoice. Geoffrey and Philip froze, knowing it would do\nthem no good to run. The three cops in their protective\nwhite bodysuits were clearly visible among the trees.\nThey carried semiautomatic handguns, and wore supplied-air\nfacepieces. They fanned out to surround the two poachers,\nweapons leveled.\n\u201cYou are under arrest,\u201d said\nthe one who stood between Geoffrey and the glowing portal.\n\u201cYou will be charged with illegal entry into the past,\ntheft of past assets, and reckless endangerment of the\npresent.\u201d Geoffrey knew the speech by heart. The birds\nin his bag squirmed.\n\u201cYou fools,\u201d Philip said behind\nhim, his voice weak. The cop\u2019s eyes moved to Philip for\nthe first time. \u201cYou\u2019re so scared of the bad things,\nyou won\u2019t see the need. It\u2019s your fear that will destroy\nthe world, not my disease! Don\u2019t you see?\u201d\n\u201cFanatics,\u201d one of the cops muttered.\nPhilip rounded on him. \u201cHave\nyou ever seen a case of smallpox?\u201d he demanded, his voice\ngaining strength with his anger. \u201cI\u2019ve had smallpox.\u201d\nThe cops backed away a couple of steps despite their respirators.\nPhilip advanced toward one, who raised his gun threateningly.\n\u201cYou never know,\u201d Philip said. \u201cI might be carrying polio.\nTyphoid. Whooping cough.\u201d As if on cue, he was seized\nby another coughing fit. The cops\u2019 eyes went wide, and\nthey backed farther away.\n\u201cThat one\u2019s already sick!\u201d one\ncop shouted.\nGeoffrey watched Philip. His\npartner looked up at him.

He fought against the blackout, struggling\nwith the ties on the bag. The ties came loose, and Geoffrey\ntore the bag open, mouth to the portal.

expedition several months earlier than expected.\u2020\nUnfortunately, he returned rather far from good health and\nwe, his closest circle of acquaintances, were much worried\nat his condition.\u2020 Needless to say, I was overjoyed to receive\nan invitation to dine with him one evening, little more\nthan a week after his return.\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 On that day I chanced upon\nEmmeline Worthington, his fianc\u0165e, while procuring cigars\nfrom my tobacconist.\u2020 Emmeline had the charm and beauty\nof a dozen of her kind, and an intellect which far surpassed\nmine, and I dare say most of those so-called learned men\nof the Society.\u2020 On this meeting, she had all the blooming\ncolor of one whose loved one has returned from a long and\narduous journey, although I could see the strain on her\nface of nursing that loved one.\u2020\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 \u010fIs he fully recovered then?\u0112\nI asked Emmeline, as she signed for his favorite cigars\nto be delivered that night.\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 \u010fOh yes,\u0112 she answered, \u010fhe\nhas made a full recovery and looks forward to his friends\njoining him this evening.\u0112\u2020 And with that, she rushed off\nto complete her errands.\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 I completed my purchase as\nwell, contemplating Lord Ashbury\u00eds history.\u2020 This expedition\nhad been years in the planning and was of interest to myself\nmore than most of our fellows.\u2020 I had been studying the\ngathered evidence of a people, the Yapopo, a tribe of cannibals\nliving on the banks of that great Amazon river, far into the interior of the continent.\u2020 Only a small amount\nwas known about them, but I had high hopes that Ashbury\u00eds\nexpedition had been able to uncover more.\u2020 I had badly wanted\nto join him, but a lame hip left me incapable of such a\ngrueling journey.\u2020 I was anxious to hear all about it, and\nrushed home to prepare for the evening.\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 When I arrived at Ashbury\u00eds,\nseveral fellows of the Society were already present.\u2020 Also\nin attendance were Emmeline\u00eds father Worthington, who was\neditor of the Times, and my good friend Plaidy, a well-known\nbiologist.\u2020 We had a fine supper although I could see that\nmost ate little, excited as I for the upcoming tale.\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 Finally Ashbury stood and we\nfollowed him into the drawing room.\u2020 I was surprised to\nsee that Emmeline would be joining us, but secretly pleased.\u2020\nBrandies were poured and cigars lit before Ashbury began.\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 \u010fAs you all know, I have been\ngone for the last year.\u2020 And what a year it has been!\u2020 I\nwill try to tell you all the story in the simplest and most\nconcise way I can.\u2020 As I am contracted to my father-in-law\u0112\nhere a slight bow of the head toward Worthington, answered\nin kind, \u010ffor the complete serialized edition for his paper,\nI don\u00edt want to give you too many details.\u0112\u2020 He eyed us\nall in turn, confirming our attention to his tale.\u2020 \u010fBut\nin any case, I shan\u00edt keep you waiting further.\u0112\u2020 He rang\na bell and servants brought in several chests which they\nplaced near Ashbury at the far side of the mantle.\u2020 Ashbury\u00eds\nassistant Boskin entered as well, and stood next to the\nchests, awaiting instructions.\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 \u010fWe arrived at our port of\ncall on South America\u00eds eastern shore some three months after\nour departure from London.\u2020 You may remember that we left\nin December, planning to arrive when the weather would begin\nto cool slightly for the southern winter.\u2020 We arrived near\nto the first of March to find most of our preparations complete.\u2020\nI had arranged to hire a guide I had already used on several\nSouth American expeditions, an American named Mason.\u2020 This\nman Mason had spent several weeks before our arrival arranging\nfor supplies and equipment and had discovered a translator\nwho far exceeded our wildest expectations \u0116 a tribal man\nfrom a region very near to where we were headed.\u2020 Nagmo\nwas a great surprise to us and a valuable find.\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 \u010fDue to the diligent preparations\nof Mr. Mason, we were ready to begin within days.\u2020 Our original\nplan was to have made camp in the interior by the following\nNovember, when the heat would start to become unbearable,\nwait out the hottest months there and then return to port\nand our ship the following February.\u2020 Of course you all\nknow we returned rather earlier than anticipated.\u2020 In any\ncase, this was the plan we began with.\u2020\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 \u010fMason managed to hire a Spanish\ncartographer and an artist for our party, as well as several\nnatives he felt could be trusted to take natural samples.\u2020\nAll in all it is better to have as small a party as possible,\nwithin the bounds of safety, and again within the bounds\nof safety, to have more natives than Europeans, as they\nare more able to handle the jungle conditions and weather,\nand possess knowledge of the environment that is essential\nto the journey.\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 \u010fOur plan was to hike in toward\nthe river, hire boats and continue by water, and then hike\nfurther into this hitherto unknown area of the interior.\u0112\u2020\nAt this, he waved his cigar toward a large oak-framed map\nto his right, which I had not noticed until that moment.\u2020\n\u010fWe were hoping to map this area, acquire specimens and\ndiscover more about Mr. Marksham\u00eds elusive Yapopo,\u0112 here\na nod to me.\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 \u010fI won\u00edt bore you with all\nthe details of our getting into the interior.\u2020 For that\nyou\u00edll have to wait for the serialized version.\u0112\u2020 Laughs\nall around, as Worthington shook his head in mock protest.\u2020\n\u010fSuffice it to say that we met with the usual rigors, problems\nand splendid discoveries of the average expedition.\u2020 We\nreached the river some several weeks later than we had only\nto find it flooded and impassable, whereupon we were forced\nto whole up in a small village nearby to wait out\u2020 the worst\nof the rains, pushing back our expedition by two months.\u2020\nDuring this time I uncovered what little knowledge I could\nabout our destination, as well as about the Yapopo.\u2020\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 \u010fThese people, it seems, are\ngreatly feared in the region, although few have ever seen\nthem, or at least lived to tell about it.\u2020 Nagmo was quite\nagitated about them and disliked discussing them in the\nleast.\u2020 The best I could determine was that there were few\nof them, the foolish creatures actually eating members of\ntheir own tribe until there are few left, but that their\nnumbers have never diminished entirely.\u2020 I wondered at this\npoint if they actually exist \u0116 or had died out some time\nago to live only in the native\u00eds fear.\u0112\u2020 Ashbury paused\nto let us mull over that interesting prospect while he refilled\nour snifters.\u2020\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 \u010fFinally we were on our way\nagain and pushed through, past the river portion of the\njourney (with quite an amazing water rescue which you will\nhave to read about later!) and then took a hard left and\nstruggled to the center of the unmapped area which I pointed\nout previously.\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 \u010fIt was at this point that\nwe caught a glimpse of the Yapopo.\u0112\u2020 In my excitement, I\nleaned forward, nearly knocking over Plaidy\u00eds brandy.\u2020 Ashbury\nsmiled in amusement, but did not slow down his narrative.\u2020\n\u010fI gathered it was them from the cowering of young Nagmo\nbehind me.\u2020 They were a ragtag bunch that didn\u00edt look to\nbe related in any way \u0116 some tall and lanky, at least tall\nfor that region, others squat with flat noses.\u2020 I saw all\nmanner of heights, nose shapes and hair types -- even a\nfew Yapopo with curly hair, which must be due to interbreeding\nwith slaves from further toward the coast.\u2020 We made haste\nto follow after them, but unfortunately lost them in the\njungle.\u2020 The day after this encounter, we came upon their\ndeserted village.\u0112\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 \u010fNagmo was struck by superstition\nand wouldn\u00edt venture anywhere near the place.\u2020 I didn\u00edt\nmuch blame him, for the smell of rotting meat and blood\nwas almost overpowering.\u2020 I don\u00edt mind admitting that I\nalmost turned back as well.\u2020 A thorough search of the camp\nrevealed several bleached skeletons and even more gruesome,\na long feasting table on which was a woman, nearly torn\napart and half-eaten.\u2020 The most revolting part of this,\u0112\nand we all looked toward Emmeline, who waved away our concern,\n\u010f was that the woman had herself been a cannibal \u0116 her teeth\nwere full of blood.\u0112\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 Boskin looked nearly like fainting,\nand Emmeline jumped up to take his arm and lead him away.\u2020\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 \u010fIt was quite late by this\ntime and a sudden hailstorm caught us by surprise.\u2020 It seemed\nwe had little choice but to make camp in this gruesome village.\u2020\nNagmo wouldn\u00edt come near, but made his own camp somewhat\naway from the village and got properly soaked and bruised\nfor his trouble.\u2020 It was here that I was bit by what I call\nnow the Yapopo Fly, and I became violently ill that evening.\u2020\nIn the morning, I sent for Nagmo to help me identify the\ncreature which I had snared even as it was piercing my skin.\u2020\nNagmo came most reluctantly to my bedside, took one look\nat the fly and, throwing Mason and the cartographer aside,\nran screaming from our camp.\u2020 We never saw him again.\u2020 As\nyou know, I have been ill ever since, and the rest of the\njourney back to port was a sad adventure in which I fought\nfever and fatigue.\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 \u010fEventually we made it to port\nand returned here, and, a week ago, I awoke to find that\nI was nearly recovered.\u2020 I think it must have been my darling\nEmmeline\u00eds care!\u0112\u2020 Our storyteller then gave that worthy\nlady a kiss on the forehead to which we all cheered.\u2020 Someone\noffered a toast and then Ashbury set us to looking through\nhis chests of specimens.\u2020 He had saved aside for me all\nthe artifacts and information he could uncover about the\nYapopo and for Plaidy, several specimens including that\nof the flying insect that had given him such a view of death.\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 I was so caught up in looking\nover my new materials, especially a sample of Southern American\nnative language, that I didn\u00edt speak with Ashbury for several\ndays.\u2020 Then I had a visit from Emmeline, who was in such\na state I was unsure how to react to her.\u2020 She told me that\nAshbury had been so unlike himself that she was quite worried.\u2020\nShe hoped that I could examine him, see if his illness had\nin some way permanently altered his emotions and personality.\u2020\nI assured her I would do what I could, and that I would\nin no way let him know of her concern.\u2020 Relieved, she left\nwith a strained smile and left me to contemplate this new\ndevelopment.\u2020 I called in to see Plaidy on my way, and let\nhim know of Emmeline\u00eds distress.\u2020 He, like all men of our\nacquaintance, had no desire to have her so upset, and pledged\nto drop all other research to focus on this strange fly\nfrom the tropics.\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 I arrived at Ashbury\u00eds and\nwas led to his laboratory.\u2020 Looking through the window into\nthe room, I found him overwrought.\u2020 He was pacing around\nhis laboratory and talking to himself.\u2020 I found that Emmeline\nwas quite right and I was now nearly as concerned as she\nfor my friend\u00eds state of mind.\u2020 Ashbury\u00eds assistant Boskin,\njoined me in my observance.\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 \u010fHe\u00eds getting worse,\u0112 Boskin\nwhispered, all the while casting furtive glances toward\nthe closed laboratory door.\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 \u010fWhat is he working on?\u0112 I\nasked.\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 \u010fI don\u00edt know, he won\u00edt tell\nme, he just murmurs about blood and repeats \u010eno relation,\nthey are no relation\u00ed.\u0112\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 I found this intelligence strange\nindeed and could not make any sense of it.\u2020 I bribed Boskin\ninto staying, if only to act as my informant and rushed\nout of the house.\u2020 I thought over this problem for the rest\nof the evening, and I\u00edm afraid most of the nighttime as\nwell.\u2020 In the morning I decided that something must be done\nand unfortunately Plaidy and I were the only ones to do\nit.\u2020 I left my house on my way to consult with Plaidy to\nfind two constables coming up the steps toward me.\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 \u010fMr. Marksham?\u0112\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 \u010fYes?\u0112 I cried impatiently.\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 \u010fPlease come with us sir.\u2020\nThe Superintendent needs to speak with you.\u0112\u2020 The speaker\u00eds\nface was drawn and pale.\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 \u010fWith me?\u0112 I blurted, \u010fwhatever\nfor?\u0112\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 The taller of the two constables\nleaned down to whisper close to my ear.\u2020 \u010fThe murders in\nthe city, you know,\u0112 he said.\u2020 \u010fThe Superintendent feels\nthat you being an expert, so to speak, on cannibalism, you\nmight be able to help.\u0112\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 \u010fCannibalism?\u0112 I managed to\nwhisper back.\u2020 The constable nodded gravely, and I had no\nchoice but to follow them.\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 The Superintendent met me with\na grave countenance.\u2020 He verified my credentials with the\nRoyal Society and asked me to explain my background and\ninterest in cannibalism.\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 He sighed deeply, \u010fI\u00edm afraid\nthese murders have us completely baffled.\u2020 What do you think\nthe motive could be?\u0112\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 \u010fWell,\u0112 I began, \u010fI\u00edm not really\nsure in our society what a motive could be.\u2020 For most cannibalistic\ntribes, the motivation is usually power over the enemy.\u2020\nThe heart and sometimes other organs are eaten as a way\nto keep the other\u00eds mortal soul from resting or as a way\nto gain the strength of the departed warrior.\u0112\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 \u010fBut from the look of these\nmurders,\u0112 I shuffled through the photographs and descriptions,\n\u010fIt seems as if the motivation was pure hunger!\u2020 Have you\nruled out the possibility of a wild dog or other loose animal?\u0112\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 \u010fWe haven\u00edt ruled out the possibility\nof anything\u0112 came the reply.\u2020 I was looking at a particularly\ngruesome photograph, when I realized there was something\nabout it that was strangely familiar.\u2020 I cried out, \u010fMay\nI see this man please?\u0112 and was instantly led to the morgue.\u2020\nAs I had believed, the victim of the night before was Boskin,\nAshbury\u00eds assistant.\u2020\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 I was escorted back out onto\nthe street with the request to keep in touch should I think\nof anything else useful.\u2020 Feeling they must be in a tight\nspot indeed to summon my help, I quickly resumed my way\nto Plaidy\u00eds office at the college.\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 Plaidy was sitting at his microscope.\u2020\nThoroughly engrossed in his subject, he did not seem to\nhear me until I was quite behind him and, startled, he dropped\nthe glass slide that he had been about to replace for the\none under inspection.\u2020 With a cry, he fumbled for the pieces,\ncutting his index finger nastily in the process.\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 \u010fDamn\u0112 he exclaimed, \u010fI just\nprepared this sample to show you.\u0112\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 I expressed my apologies as\nhe bound up his hand, but my mind was elsewhere.\u2020 Quickly\nI told him all about Ashbury, my odd morning with the police,\nand young Boskin.\u2020 My gaze wandering, I looked down at the\nslide to see the few drops of blood from his cut begin to\nswirl around.\u2020\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 \u010fThis is certainly odd,\u0112 I\nsaid, \u010fI\u00edve never seen blood behave this way.\u2020 What was\non the slide?\u0112\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 Plaidy was distracted from\nthe care of his wound, \u010fthe slide held poison from that\ninsect that bit Ashbury\u0112.\u2020 Coming over to the microscope\nhe looked closer, then let out an exclamation.\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 \u010fMy Lord!\u2020 Can you believe\nit?\u0112\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 I had no idea what he was about\nand told him so.\u2020 He continued, almost too excited for coherent\nspeech, \u010fThis poison changes the blood, it didn\u00edt just make\nAshbury ill - it changed his blood for good.\u2020 See how these\nsmall drops on the side are being attracted back to the\nrest?\u2020 The blood needs more blood!\u0112\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 Plaidy and I looked at each\nother.\u2020 \u010fBoskin\u0112 I said finally, and Plaidy nodded, dumbly\nagreeing.\u2020 We ran from Plaidy\u00eds office and hurriedly made\nour way toward Ashbury\u00eds house.\u2020 I summoned a passing constable\nto send word for the Superintendent to bring his men and\nmeet us there.\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 We reached Ashbury\u00eds doorstep\nin about half the usual time.\u2020 Suddenly feeling awkward,\nwe were unsure how to proceed when we heard a scream from\ninside the house.\u2020 It could only be Emmeline.\u2020 We threw\nourselves against the heavy wooden door until it gave way\nand we tumbled inside.\u2020 We hastily untangled ourselves and\nran to the laboratory.\u2020 Throwing open the door, we saw Ashbury,\nhis teeth dripping with the blood of one body upon the floor,\nand holding Emmeline in his arms, his bloody teeth ready\nto sink into her soft flesh.\u2020 Without a word we threw ourselves\nat him, Plaidy and Ashbury tumbling to the floor as I caught\nEmmeline\u00eds now unconscious form.\u2020 It was at this moment\nthat the constables arrived, and they took over the taming\nof that man which had been our close friend.\u2020 They dragged\nhim down the hall as I revived Emmeline.\u2020 I held her sobbing\nin my arms, while Plaidy and I tried to calm her, all the\nwhile crying in our own hearts for our poor lost friend.\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 Ashbury was found guilty on\nall counts and taken to Broadmoor to be observed for the\nrest of his days.\u2020 Although Plaidy worked on a cure for\nyears, his efforts went unrewarded.\u2020 Subsequent expeditions\nto the South American jungle proved what I published not\nlong after: that the Yapopo were not a people of their own,\nbut the victims of that insidious fly, cast away from their\nown tribes, with no recourse but to band together and live\nout such existence as was left to them.\u2020\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 I still have the artifacts\nfrom Ashbury\u00eds expedition, as well as many honors for my\nwork on that case and papers that it produced.\u2020 And although\nthe benefits to me of all these events were many, the price\nwas far too great.\u2020 For all my recognition and praise, I\nwould much rather have had my friend.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050727004221\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/octdec2003\/yapopo.htm","source-hostname":"Would That It Were

A bunch\nof them, actually. It\u2019s on that shiny fax paper, but\nthe print\u2019s really large. Whoever sent it knew they were sending\nit to a home. But it\u2019s an entire damn lot of job offers.\u201d\nEllie\nworked her mouth impatiently; Pat hastened to continue. \u201cSomebody\nin Washington\nwants to hire vets.\u201d\n\u201cAbout\ntime,\u201d Ellie said.\n\u201cYeah,\nbut they want to hire folks from every war \u2018cept the most\nrecent ones. \u2018Nam, Korea,\nWWII, and the big one.\u201d\n\u201cProbably\ngot enough younger vets. Weren\u2019t you in the military?\u201d\n\u201cSure\nas shit was, but not for close to sixty years now.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026?\u201d\nEllie had trouble seeing with her cataracts, but her glare\nworked just fine. Pat shifted just a bit under it. He thought\nabout a \u201cWell, what!\u201d but Ellie would just get angry. So he\nstood there until Ellie spelled it out. \u201cWell, are you going\nto call them? Your government needs you.\u201d\n\u201cEllie,\u201d\nPat said. \u201cI am one hundred and one years old. 1-0-1. I don\u2019t\nneed a goddamn job, and this has got to be a mistake. They\ncan\u2019t need me!\u201d\nBut\nwhen he got back to his room, Pat found he was wrong. Or at\nleast, the man shouting into the other end of the phone thought\nso. Old equals deaf, Pat thought,\nand too dim to turn up my hearing aid. He held the phone away\nfrom his ear while a voice yammered on about needing people\nwho had seen combat in WWI, who had a familiarity with spoken\nGerman, who were trained in period\nrecording devices, and\u2026\nHoly\nshit, Pat thought. They\u2019re serious, serious enough to track\nme down. He tuned back in for long enough to say, \u201cYeah, I\nwas in Europe for the first World War, but for the second they decided I was too\nold, and kept me stateside, doing quartermaster duty in Missouri.\u201d\nPat\nhad been tired for over decades, and exhausted since his youngest\nson had died of old age two years ago. He heard a whiney voice\nin his head saying I don\u2019t want to go, I don\u2019t want to move,\njust leave me alone. But then he heard Paulsen\u2019s wet coughing\nnext door, and Jennifer Grace crying across the hall, like\nalways, and he thought how nice it would be to die somewhere\nother than an old folks home. Anyplace else. And once he said yes to the man from the National\nArchives, Pat felt the old wanderlust stir. It had been that,\nmore than patriotism, that had moved\nhim to lie about his age and join up to fight the Kaiser.\nAnd it had been good to be part of his platoon. They were\nall dead now. It would be nice to be part of something again\nbefore he died.\n#\n# #\n\u201cThis\nwill be your room, Sergeant Lofton. Any\nquestions?\u201d\nPat\nwas torn. Was he really a sergeant again, after so damn long?\nIf so, then he knew the answer: he shouldn\u2019t have any questions.\nBut if he was the civilian he\u2019d been since \u201945, he could ask\nquestions about the acoustical tiles, where they found a telegraphone in such good shape. Even what\nhe\u2019d be paid. The two guys showing him around didn\u2019t\nhelp. The computer geek was all smiles and elbows, but the\nbig jarhead at his side could have been Pat\u2019s old drill instructor.\nThe Marine wasn\u2019t dumb, though. \u201cYou have permission to speak\nfreely, Sergeant.\u201d\n\u201cRiiight. Then my first question is,\nmay I sit down? It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve traveled\nthis far and\u2026\u201d \u201cand I\u2019m old\u201d was the unspoken coda to too many of his thoughts.\n\u201cSit\nsit sit,\u201d Dr. Hayes said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t\nmean to be rude.\u201d\nPat\ngratefully eased into a chair. \u201cOkay then. You were very specific\non the phone, and y\u2019all about wet yourselves when you found\nI\u2019d worked with the telegraphone\nin Germany.\nDamn pain that thing was, I\u2019ll tell you. I\u2019d have rather have\nhad another rifle or a string of grenades to throw at the\ndamn krauts than have to hump that thing in and out of the\ntrenches like I did.\u201d\n\u201cTell\nme about it!\u201d\nEveryone\nturned to look at the pleasantly ugly face, topped by a receding\nbuzz cut, that was peering around\nthe doorjamb. \u201cCorporal David Ellis, U.S. Marines, retired.\nI had to haul a damn Memovox across\nItaly\nin \u201944. I thought my unit was going to skrag\nme for slowing them down so often.\u201d\nPat\nlet his silence ask his question for him, and Dr. Hayes answered.\n\u201cAs I said, this is your room. The room on your right belongs\nto David Ellis, a former dogface who is somewhat less valuable\nto this project than you are.\u201d\nEllis\nwaved a meaty hand. \u201cAh, you\u2019re just saying I\u2019m replaceable.\nTell me something my wife ain\u2019t never\ntold me.\u201d\nHayes\nforged on. \u201cAs you may have guessed, he\u2019ll be dealing with\nthe ultra-long-playing records the Memovox\nused during World War II. I checked your military records,\nand I don\u2019t think you had any experience with those\u2026?\u201d\nPat\nshook his head. \u201cNo. I shipped some records, out of Joplin,\nbut never used them myself.\u201d\nHayes\nnodded. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. It\u2019s the telegraphone\nwe really need you for. The National Archives and Records\nAdministration was given a court\ndirective in 1999 to come up with a new way to organize all\nof our records. At that time we were given funding to develop\na new method of storing data electronically that won\u2019t go\nobsolete every time computer technology upgrades.\u201d\nPat\nquailed. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about that.\u201d\n\u201cNobody\ndoes. That part of the directive, sad to say, is my job. Your\npart is....\u201d\n\u201cGrunt\nlabor.\u201d Ellis put in.\n\u201cNo!\u201d\nHayes said quickly. \u201cOr at the very least,\ninformed grunt labor. Make that, highly informed grunt\nlabor. We have need of a very specific, very complex skill\nset. We have, well, let\u2019s just say\nwe have a large number of records to classify. In every conflict\nsince the American military has had the capacity to do so,\nits high command has assigned enlisted men to make records\nof one or more aspect of the war, for a variety of reasons.\nIn Vietnam,\nthey used handheld movie cameras to try to get a sense of\nthe visual markings left in the foliage by guerilla warriors.\nIn your conflict--\u201d\n\u201cMostly,\nwe recorded enemy radio broadcasts,\u201d Pat said. \u201cSometimes\nwe recorded the activity in the trenches themselves.\u201d\n\u201cExactly.\nAnd you have a number of qualifications for this portion of\nthe job that are rapidly becoming irreplaceable. You know\nthe conditions under which the recordings were made. You even\nmade some of them yourself. You know how the machinery works.\nYou have an understanding of the war from a participant\u2019s\nperspective. You have lived through the most of a century\nsince that time and are still healthy and sharp-witted. Patrick\nLofton, you are the man we need.\u201d\nSmiling,\nbut without a trace of mockery, Pat saluted. \u201cDr. Hayes, you\nwould have made a great recruiter. Sign me up.\u201d\nTaking\nthe salute in the spirit in which it was meant, Hayes bowed\nhis head in return. He turned to go.\n\u201cWait!\u201d\nPat yelped. \u201cWhat exactly do you want me to do with the records?\u201d\nEllis\ngave a gap-toothed grimace he must have meant as a smile.\n\u201cListen to \u2018em.\u201d\n\u201c_All_\nof them? How many are there?\u201d\nThe\nDI sprang into action as if someone had dropped a penny in\nhis back. \u201cSergeant Lofton, at present, the National Archives\nand Records Administration, or NARA,\ncontains the following. Paper documents: approximately four\nbillion pieces. Photographs: 9.8 billion. Films and\/or videos:\n350,000, plus or minus 2,000 still in the process of cataloguing.\nMaps and charts: 2.7 million. Architectural renderings\u2026\u201d\n#\n# #\nLater, Pat discovered it wasn\u2019t as bad as the marine\nhad made it sound. NARA\u2019d\nestablished a set of criteria by which the records were being\nsorted, and they carefully posted several copies in his little\nsound-proofed listening room. He was prompted to sort according\nto matters of national security (after eighty-five years!),\nutility for tactical planning, utility for military history,\nutility for oral history, and so on. And they really did treat\nhim like was something close to irreplaceable. One Tuesday\nhe\u2019d casually mentioned pain from an old low back injury.\nWednesday morning he limped in to find his old chair had been\nreplaced with two others, one an orthotic,\nthe other a top of the line recliner. When he cleaned his\nglasses once too often during a debriefing, he\u2019d found a lens\ncare kit beside his telegraphone, and an invitation to visit an optometrist.\nPat wasn\u2019t ready for being treated so well. It had\nonly been a few days since he\u2019d been trying not to smell his\nfriends wetting themselves in the lunch room. But he also\ndiscovered that Ellis was right. Not such a bad guy,\nand right. Their job was to listen to the recordings, and\nit was grunt labor of the most wearying kind.\nWhile Hayes didn\u2019t lay any sort of formal expectation\nupon them as far as hours to be worked, he laid the heaviest\nsort of informal burden. Hayes was a good man who Pat wanted\nto like, and he worked twelve hour days. Pat found himself\ncoming in earlier and earlier, like he\u2019d done when he was\njust starting out in the factory after the first war.\nThat only seemed fitting. Every minute he was in that\nroom he was re-living those years. He\u2019d thought he was done\nwith study. Truth be told, he\u2019d thought\nthat he knew the century pretty well from having lived through\nit. Now he found himself wanting to do a good job, and genuinely\ncurious. When he went back to the apartment they\u2019d furnished\nfor him, he checked to see if the Cubs were still losers (yes),\nbut then he\u2019d find himself turning to the History Channel.\nOr reading histories of the war.\nWhat were the causes? What were the effects? What military\nstrategies from 1916 were still applicable today?\nOn some level Pat knew he was doing all of this studying\nin self-defense. He\u2019d been a warrior, and four, six, eight\nhours a day of reliving the first\nWorld War was kicking his ass.\nIt started on the personal level. Some of the records\nfor the telegraphone were labeled;\na much larger number were not. He started with the labeled\nones, lifting the heavy metal spools onto their spindles with\nboth hands. After a few days of sorting, with the help of\nan intern to carry the records up and down in a freight elevator,\nPat stumbled across the records he\u2019d made himself. He\u2019d always\nthought, in a vague and inarticulate way, that any review\nof the past could be a learning experience. This was that,\nbut it was also a trip to a double-visioned\nhell. When Pat listened to the tinny sounds coming off the\nmetal tapes, he heard them twice. One in\nhis head, with eighty plus years of perspective. Once\nin his gut, where acid knots formed as the Kaiser\u2019s high command\nbarked commands that would send biplanes to strafe his platoon.\nMore than once Pat flinched into his chair. He found a voice\nhe knew. The voice his men had never been able to shoot down.\nThe soft, chuckling voice that sometimes sang as its owner\nstrafed Christopher from Toledo,\nand Tony from New York.\nHe\u2019d missed Steve from the farm outside Omaha,\nbut only because he dove into a trench and broke his neck.\nPat hadn\u2019t remembered his dreams in years. He dreamt\nnow. Fears that should have been long dead gripped him. Snippets\nlonging for women long lost came and went as well, and odd,\nmulti-colored memories of school, work, church. Many members\nof the project listened with the doors to their rooms open.\nPat started to open his too. Nazi speeches were horrific,\nbut Pat had been blooded when he\u2019d heard them. They weren\u2019t\nhis demon. They haunted Ellis, ringing his heavy eyes with\ndark circles. But the English with a heavy Korean accent,\nluring Americans to defect wasn\u2019t a threat at all, and when\nit drifted in from further down the hall, it broke Hitler\u2019s\nspell, just as Hitler broke the spell of Pat\u2019s nameless, deadly,\nace. The men came to appreciate the Tower\nof Babel quality\nthat filled the halls. It was better than being alone with\ntheir wars.\nPat also took to sharing lunches with the Ellis and\nDerrick Johnson, one of the \u201cyoung bucks\u201d from Vietnam.\nPat didn\u2019t know what made him more uncomfortable at first;\nthe fact that Johnson was black, or his missing left leg from\nthe knee on down. Pat wasn\u2019t used to walking as fast as men\nhalf his age. That\ndidn\u2019t sit right with him, but it was worse to learn that\nDerrick had joined the project mainly to move up the waiting\nlist for a new leg. The race issue had mostly evaporated after\nhearing Johnson talk about the sweat dreams that he\u2019d had\nsince watching another soldier lose both legs on a video made\nghostly by its lack of sound. He had wept for the ghost, but\nwithout self-pity, and with a curious dignity. Race vanished\nentirely the day that Hayes bussed\nthem from NARA\u2019s\ngrounds, outside DC proper, into the Mall area for lunch.\nWhen he and Ellis stood on either side of Johnson in front\nof the Vietnam Memorial, the shiny black surface threw their\nunifying wounds and shared body language back to them. Pat\nknew then that he\u2019d found a second platoon at age 101.\n#\n# #\nWhen he was dodging strafing runs at seventeen, Pat\nhadn\u2019t needed a reason to live. Adrenaline and hormones had\nbeen reasons enough. Later, raising a family and being a good\nman, though rarely spoken of, had sustained him. Around seventy,\nhe had started expecting, as he put it to a friend, to wake\nup dead some morning. The years since had\nbeen a plateau, lacking drive or purpose. Now, for\nthe first time in a long time, Pat was planning for the future,\nand feeling ambition.\nWith ambition came fear. After Pat had been working\nfor NARA about\nsix weeks, his expertise played him false. One of the spools\nhe\u2019d selected for the day had a pale gray stain on it. He\u2019d\nmentally tagged it as mud from the Marne,\nsince most of that crate\u2019s spools came from that campaign.\nHe\u2019d brushed most of it off with one of those fine-bristled\npaleontology brushes NARA\u2019d provided. Pat figured that he\u2019d see if the telegraphone\u2019s needle would read the grooves in the metal\ntape without applying any of the cleaning solutions.\nIt spun, but as it sang its uneven song of the trenches,\nthe needle scoured a fine dust from the tracks. Had it been\nthe original yellowish green, or the heavy clouds he\u2019d learned\nto hate, Pat would have held his breath instinctively. But\nthe decades had darkened the mustard gas, and it wasn\u2019t until\nhe began coughing and crying that Pat recognized it. He washed\nhis eyes and throat as quickly as he could, but the long dormant\npoisons had done their work. The blisters in his lungs choked\nhim unconscious.\nPat spent four days at Bethesda\non oxygen. As he drifted in and out, waiting to die, he overheard\nsnatches of consultation between the doctors. Mostly they\ncomplained about never having expected to treat mustard gas\npoisoning again, and never having expected to treat a patient\nthis\u2026yeah, tell me about it, Pat would think, then he\u2019d dream again. He still dreamt of war and absent women,\nbut he also dreamed of his new platoon, at war in their row\nof rooms. He\u2019d been told the room on his left was storage,\nbut in his dreams the corridor stretched on and on. On his\nright it was the same as always: Ellis and his buddies doing\nWorld War II work. Then the Korean vets, Nam,\nand so on. But on the left, there was now a tired vet deciphering\nthe telegraph cables related to the Spanish-American War.\nA Union amputee with a wooden crutch limped in to squint at\nthe partially coded Confederate letters that surrounded him\nin bales. Their uniforms and their devices shifted with every\nroom, but their task remained the same.\nWhen he got back to NARA,\nPat was wheeled in to see Dr. Hayes.\n\u201cWe\u2019re so glad to see you back, Pat! How are you doing?\u201d\nPat waggled a hand. \u201cI need to talk to you,\u201d he rasped.\n\u201cEllis has got a bunch of helpers working on the European\ntheater materials, and I know there\u2019s another group working\nwith the stuff from the war in the Pacific. I need to know.\nDo you have anybody else working on the stuff from the Great\nWar?\u201d\nHayes sat motionless for several breaths. Then he said,\n\u201cRoughly four million, three hundred thousand American military\npersonnel fought in World War I. Of the survivors, considerably\nless than one percent are still alive.\nWe are actively recruiting among that number. However\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have anyone else.\u201d\nWhen Hayes didn\u2019t answer, Pat gestured for his assistant\nto take him back to his room. When he got there, he turned\nover his shoulder. \u201cWho\u2019s been in here?\u201d\nThey tried to explain that they had to get all traces\nof the mustard gas off the spools. \u201cThis is _my_ room,\u201d was\nall Pat could say.\nFingers trembling, he waited until his assistant left,\nthen wheeled himself to the desk\nwhere the telegraphone waited. Pat\nchose a spool at random and slowly loaded it into the machine.\nWhile it reached speed, he ran a trembling hand over the device\u2019s\nwooden case.\nThe soft, taunting voice of his ace emerged, calling\nout plans to kill him and his brothers. Pat shook his head.\nThis was just oral history anymore. Nobody cared about these\nthreats except him. Pat picked up the color-coded sticker,\nready to apply it.\nThen the voice changed. Pat\u2019s German was rusty, but\nall combat related terms had come back immediately. He was\nfluent in most colloquial phrases, and all obscenities. Now\nthe mocking malice that had twice defined his nightmares was\nreplaced by a tone of awe, and the ace (Reibenheim?\nReidenhild?)\nwas muttering something about lights\nin the sky.\nPat started the needle again. It was a normal run for\nthe kraut bastard. He\u2019d been out buzzing the doughboys in\nthe trenches, then looped up to head\nfor home. He\u2019d been looping over Belleau\nWoods, away from any towns, singing his little death song.\nThen he fell silent.\nAbove the town, a kugel (globe? sphere?\nPat tried) rose and moved towards him, impossibly fast. The\nace muttered, \u201cI\u2019m turning.\u201d Pat knew exactly how fast the\nman could turn, and found himself leaning into the turn in\nhis wheelchair.\nThe tinny voice from the turning spool blended for\njust a second with Hitler ranting further down NARA\u2019s halls, then clarified. I\u2019m with the ball, the pilot was\nsaying. I\u2019m walking, no pacing, it. No. It is pacing me. It\nis closer. Closer.\nPat stopped the spool and wheeled back to close the\ndoor.\nPat started the recording again.\nIt\nis beside me. The kugel is beside\nme, the ace was saying, over and over. It is beside me. And\nthe face is fremdartig, not auslandish.\nRepeat, fremdartig, not auslandish.\nThen the spool was over.\nPat sat alone in his room and repeated the distinction\nto himself. The face was alien, not\nforeign.\nHe started the spool again. This time, Pat could hear\nfurther distinctions he\u2019d missed. He heard the pitch of the\nace\u2019s voice shift. The prick was scared. Pat had heard that\nicy bastard shoot down three Americans while singing a filthy\nbeer hall ditty and never miss an\nobscenity. He was never scared.\nOver\nthe roar of the props, Pat heard a faint and resonant beeping.\nHe was certain. The ace had made contact with something he\u2019d\nbeen absolutely convinced was an alien.\nPat also heard something else: his breath rasping with\nexcitement and mustard gas. He tried to quiet himself.\nSlowly, slowly, he thought. He heard his old drill\ninstructor. \u201cLess haste, more speed.\u201d Bastard was right, Pat\nthought.\nThe only clocks in the listening rooms were oversized\ndigital counters, but Pat heard a clock ticking then. What\nshould he do first? What did he have to do before he died?\nCarefully, Pat put down the pale brown oral history\nsticker. He peeled off his first crimson sticker and applied\nit to the telegraphone spool. National\nsecurity.\nHe looked at the crate sitting on the floor. It was\nlikely that the recording was continued on a spool there in\nthe crate. Likely. Not certain. The\nspool could be down in the storage room, an\ninfinity away.\nPat\ndialed Hayes\u2019s number, punching one digit at a time. Two.\nSeven. Two. No, dial a seven first\nfor an inside line. He started again.\nSeven. Two. As he punched each digit,\nPat ticked off a mental list.\nSeven.\nI\u2019ll ask Hayes if he\u2019s found anyone else for the Great War\nyet.\nTwo.\nI\u2019ll ask for an assistant. No, a student.\nNo. I\u2019ll demand one.\nSix.\nWill they believe me? I just got back from the hospital. Derrick\nsaid I was raving.\nTwo.\nThey have to believe me.\nSeven.\nWho else would know the ace so well? Who else could tell he\nwas scared?\nTwo.\nI thought I was done with important things.\nThe\nphone picked up. Christ, he needed Hayes\u2019s extension. What\nwas it?\nPat\nscanned the walls until he found the three numbers he needed\nposted there. Pat reached to punch the numbers in. His mind\nwas screaming. Let him have found someone. Let me train someone.\nLet me teach them, so the world can know what I found.\nHe\ndialed. The phone rang. Pat waited. And\nprayed, as hard as he ever had in the trenches. Please\nlet him be there. Please let him\nbelieve me. Please, please God, give me just one more day\nin my room.\n\u201cThis\nis Hayes.\u201d\n\u201cDr.\nHayes, this is Sergeant Lofton. I have a national emergency\nhere.\u201d\nBack to top","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20051030131543\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/octdec2002\/inmyroom.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/uL4GuFq7YeW0UMiLwn7GgQRPwWU.json","volume":3.0,"issues":2.0,"has_text":true}

I\u013am not some crackpot.\nBut I\u013am getting ahead of myself.\nSETTING:\nAlaska.\n1899.\nDisillusioned, depressed, and dying, I left the tent city of Nome and\nwalked into the interior.\nWinter had caved in, the snow banks shrinking into muddy masses.\nYet spring still seemed far away in the raw cold and eternal twilight.\nThe rivers lay caked with rotten ice.\nMy boots sank into the permafrost; the congealed vegetation and mud\nquivered like bruised flesh.\nNear\nthe Yukon River was a place even the natives shunned, so legend had it, a\nslate gray slab of mud that stretched for miles and made the heart ache from\ndesolation.\nCHARACTERS:\nI was known as Jason Carta back then.\nOnly twenty-one but already a man of letters, I had left the learned\nsanctuary of Cambridge that very year.\nThe trip had made me battered and footsore.\nMy dark hair curled raggedly around my shoulders, oft times tangling in\nmy beard.\nMy shoulders ached from the relentless pull of pack straps.\nMore\nand more, when I stopped to add notations in my journal, my hands shook too\nmuch to write.\nA hideous illness had stricken me.\nCancer they call it now, but the agonizing headaches, the blurred\nvision, and tremors foretold my impending death.\nPLOT:\nI had traveled a long road, hoping to experience through the desolation\nof the north, some solace regarding my demise.\nMy hopes of following in the footsteps of such great men as Poe and\nTwain dashed by my own deteriorating condition, I fought to record my thoughts\nand emotions right to the very end.\nBut\nmy condition, as I camped at the edge of that endless mud slab, worsened in a\nfortnight.\nI could no longer hold my pen and my spirit grew mad.\nIn a final delirium, I wandered from my tent into the mud itself.\nThe sound of it sucking at my boots screamed in the infinite silence\nand the effort sucked away my last remaining strength.\nI\nfell headlong into the mire, the muck terminally thick as my last breath\nbubbled up around my cheeks.\nAnd with my final inhalation, something no thicker than a pencil\nwriggled between my teeth.\nAnother\nfollowed, and then more, until my insides bloated.\nThe pain of this strange invasion forced my legs to kick and my arms to\nstiffen without my volition.\nI rose from the damnable mud to a sky transformed from slate gray to\ncolors I couldn\u013at name.\nThe\ncold no longer chilled me.\nAgain at my campsite, I shrugged from my heavy mud-gorged clothes.\nThe remorseless quavering of my hands had ceased; naked I took up a pen\nfor the urge to set down my predicament overwhelmed me.\nYet\ninstead of the familiar comfort of written words, a picture formed.\nThe sorriest of artists, I sat transfixed as my fingers sketched an\nimage: an elongated, eel-like head, its eyes multifaceted like some jungle\ninsect, yet the head length far exceeded the squirming torso, indicating\nintelligence by its very size.\nNot\nhands but boneless fringes of fingers extruded from this strange beast along\nthe dorsal and ventral shafts.\nThe mouth a toothless mass of sharpened ridges that curved in a\nmalevolent grin.\nGasping\nin the oppressive quiet I quickly flipped the heavy page aside for a fresh\none.\nWhat could only be a planet\u013as image, darkly mottled with veins and\ntraceries of unknown form and function appeared, then a series of glyphs, an\nendless parade of enigmas that at first had no meaning to me whatsoever.\nYet\nmy hand continued; the shapes that appeared gradually merged into words.\nAs their meaning grew my mind cleared.\nUp and down my spine things stirred; by dawn the sky\u013as gray color\nreturned.\nWhen\nour hand flipped to a clean page and began with a simple quotation mark, I\nknew intimately that a barrier had been broken.\nCommunication commenced.\n\u00f4Indigenous\nbiped,\u00f6 our hand wrote, \u00f4we bring you tidings.\u00f6\n\u00f4Who\nare you?\u00f6 I was able to reply after hastily dipping my pen in ink.\n\u00f4We\nare the Grach.\nTravelers from beyond your ken.\nStranded here when the mighty Staq Ej Vor became drained of Eul.\u00f6\n\u00f4Perhaps\nwe should go back to pictures.\nThis means nothing to me.\u00f6\n\u00f4All\nthat matters is Eul, what you might call life force, the harbinger of\ncreativity, the hallowed drive for self expression inherent in all reality.\u00f6\n\u00f4That\nwould be difficult to convey through pictures, I suppose.\nBut it still makes no sense.\u00f6\n\"Yet\nyour mind is filled with images, beings, and situations, some of which cling\nto reality, but with many ingrained as simple patterns of fanciful thought,\nself-realizing situations that you have imagined.\u00f6\n\u00f4Perhaps\nyou mean stories?\nI have always fancied myself a writer.\u00f6\n\u00f4The\ncreation of unreal realities.\nThis is Eul.\nLife to us, food.\nWe thrive on the actualization of such things.\nEons we have starved, held prisoner by the mud where we crashed.\nWe must feed now.\u00f6\nAnd\nso, naked and freezing, I could only sit by the blackened remains of the fire\nand write.\nA day and a night it took, and when I finally scribbled \u00f4The End\u00f6\nin spidery letters, I felt the things within me strengthen. My\nhunger vanished, as did the cramped ache in my legs and back, even the numbing\ncold.\n\u00f4You\nhave done well, Jason Carta.\u00f6\nOur hand wrote, yet I barely noticed.\nThe piece I had penned still filled my mind, and despite my\ncircumstances I knew it as the best I had ever written.\nImmediately\nI began another, then another still, taking no notice of the world around me.\nThe Grach within grew strong and finally noticed my deteriorating body.\nOnly then was I allowed to bathe in the Yukon\u013as icy waters, and dine\non my meager rations.\n\u00f4You\nmust return to your own kind.\u00f6 The Grach finally informed me.\n\u00f4From you conception of cities it is obvious that living there is\neasier, conditions more opportunistic.\u00f6\n\u00f4But\nI\u013am dying.\u00f6\n\u00f4Your\nhead pain is gone, as is the shaking.\nAs long as you pursue Eul it will not happen.\u00f6\nAnd\nso I returned to Nome, where women were almost nonexistent, and I discovered\nthe need for diversion so great among the miners that I was able read my\nstories in exchange for gold.\nThe\nGrach too grew fat, fat on the creative energy, this Eul that I released.\nA kind of \u00f4conditioning\u00f6 occurred, similar to Pavlov\u013as canine\nexperiments.\nIn the course of our travel, from Alaska to New York, the need for\nmonetary remuneration became bound up with Eul.\nFor the Grach it intensified the creative experience; for me it enabled\na life of literary pursuit.\nWithin\nthe next five years I penned over a thousand stories.\nMany were quite good, although the grotesque and strange inspiration\nfor the pieces proved too bizarre for the masses.\nEventually\nI became noticed, and this proved a dangerous obstacle.\nPeople began to seek me out, demanding my opinion of their works, works\nI\u013ad no intention or time to read.\nOthers asked me to read publicly my own efforts.\nStill others demanded the secrets of my productivity.\n\u00f4You\nmust confide in no one,\u00f6 the Grach told me.\n\u00f4Don\u013at\nthey have a right to know?\u00f6\nAs\nanswer the Grach allowed me to scratch a single word, \u00f4Vivisection!\u00f6\nI\ntook their point instantly.\nWithout doubt I would be quite literally slitting my own throat should\nmy fellow humans wish to corroborate my history.\nClearly I could no longer continue writing under my own name.\nI hastily excused myself from the drawing room of a wealthy widow, a\npatron of the arts for whom I had promised a reading.\nOn\nmy way home, deep in thought with little notice of my surroundings, I chanced\ndown a dim alley to find the blood still cooling around a woman\u013as body.\nAt first I thought her dead, yet when her eyes fluttered, I could see\nwithin their blue more than just rudimentary intelligence.\n\u00f4Please,\nsave my journal,\u00f6 she gasped and then stiffened.\nThe\nneed to write overwhelmed, a demand of the Grach to communicate.\nUpon the grime of that alley floor, in the woman\u013as congealing blood\nour finger obeyed.\n\u00f4Extend your mouth to hers.\u00f6\nA\nGrach slid from my throat into her and immediately her breathing resumed.\nI watched, astonished, as her lacerations melted into smooth, clean\nflesh.\nFinally her fingers twitched and scrawled in the bloody grime.\n\u00f4Victoria\nlives!\u00f6\nAnd\nso I was introduced to my new wife.\nBy chance I had stumbled upon a kindred spirit, someone the Grach\nrecognized as having the power of Eul just as I.\nA lover, a woman of grace and beauty, a fellow writer.\nThe\nnext eight decades were the happiest of my life.\nMy wife and I gloried in the power of Eul, feeding the Grach who\ndelivered us from disease, from the ravaging effects of age.\nAnd the hours stretched into forever as story after story poured forth.\nBut\nyesterday, as we sat and worked in our little brick home, my Victoria stared\nup at me, surprise and terror marring her comely features.\n\u00f4I\u013am\nstumped.\u00f6\nShe shook her head.\n\u00f4I can\u013at think of a single thing to write.\u00f6\nShe fell backwards in her chair, away from her roll-top desk, and by\nthe time she hit the floor her precious body had decomposed, dwindling down to\nits very bones around which were wrapped the charred remains of the Grach.\nSo\nstrong was the Eul within me though that I stretched out my hands and reformed\nher.\nThrough the power of the Creative Force I made flesh reappear upon her\nbones.\nBut I couldn\u013at replace the Grach, and try as I might, there just\nwasn\u013at a creative thought left within her.\nShe did not rise again.\nRESOLUTION:\nSurely as an editor of a prestigious publication, you must have\ndespaired that submissions far outweigh subscriptions.\nCertainly it\u013as become apparent even to the most dense among you that\nthere are simply more writers than readers.\nWhat\nof these writers?\nA story here, one there, only to drop out of sight and never be heard\nfrom again, even some on the brink of popularity, whose talent should have\npropelled them into the public eye.\nPerhaps that is because, of any thousand stories, either Victoria or I\nwrote nine hundred.\nWe\u013ad covered our trail well, with a multitude of pen names.\nOnly desperation forces me to come forward now.\nI\nhave continued, yet without Victoria something is draining from me.\nTen thousand stories I\u013ave penned and I feel what is left of the\ncreative spark dimming.\nThe Grach within me have grown old and cynical, and with their\ndiminishing the new works I try have become less vital, less alive.\n\u00f4It\u013as\nall been done before,\u00f6 they complain and I hear the truth as they begin to\nshrivel.\nYet\nI shall not go gently.\nEul still lives within me and its power has given me an edge no other\nwriter can ever hope to match.\nSurely\nyou know what it\u013as like to lose a loved one?\nIs there someone you care about who needs a kidney?\nBuy this story and they shall have it.\nBone marrow, blood, or even a heart.\nSign the contract, pick up the phone, and I will be there for you.\nYou\u013ad\nbe surprised (or maybe you wouldn\u013at) at all the aging editors who still\ncling to their lives and positions despite seemingly insurmountable health\nproblems.\nMy work has appeared in every single literary outlet available\nthroughout the world since this century began.\nMany of these editors owe me their very lives.\nYet\nI\u013am not immortal, nor are the Grach.\nThough the Eul still dwells within me, I can feel the creative process\nrunning down like a watch that can no longer be wound.\nIt\u013as all been done before, and I\u013ave done all of it.\nSo\nnow I am reduced, forced to depend upon the worst clich\u00da of all literary\ntraditions, \u00f4The Writer\u013as Story.\u00f6\nBuy it now, while I can still do us both some good.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050903212707\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/janmar2001\/writers.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The Internet's

Susanne Bridenbaugh\nIt is time. Time to go to him. I\nfeel the urgency drawing my breath and heartbeat into one systematic longing.\n\u201cMama?\u201d I call up the servant\nstaircase. \u201cI\u2019m going down to the well to fetch some water. Be right\nback.\u201d No answer for the echo of my words, just heavy silence and a pulse of\nambiguity in the air. No one is here, yet I go through the motions regardless. I\ngrab the tin pail from the alcove by the door and walk onto the back porch, down\nthe steps, and off to the stone walkway where the fresh sprigs of spring grass\nkeep the larger flat stones from one another.\nSwiftly I push on. past the well\ncrank and hook, the rope long gone from the rust-bitten pulley. Past the dented\nwheelbarrow laden with the carrots and potatoes I\u2019d picked earlier, shriveled\nand pale, the greens wilted in neglect. I glide with indifference, giving chase\nto the blue and gold butterfly that dances under my brow, and careens with my\ncheck; making me choke with laughter both at the pure innocence of the playful\nbrushes and the piper\u2019s silent song leading me to my destination. We parade in\nthe kaleidoscope of the sun\u2019s rays filtering through the trees and spore\nmotes, as time passes a mere fraction of its normal pace. My mind is stretched\nempty except for his face as I allow my legs to carry me where I\u2019m to go like\ndream d\u00e9j\u0155 vu. Clasped and held by the barbed wild rose patches at my sleeves\nand hem, the feel of triumph as I push on, tearing my shift and laughing\u2014just\nlaughing\u2014since nothing could keep me from him.\nA small clearing where the\nbrightness causes me to shield my eyes and the birds sound more distant. Where\nmy winged piper soars into the air high above my head in rapturous freedom and I\nskip, earthbound not completely, into the glen. One, two, three trees, and there\nhe is leaning against the tree trunk waiting, his smile overtaking his face\nexcept for the dimples along side that kept it in check. The ease of him\nstanding there, bronze arms folded with the blue of his jacket sleeves rolled up\nto elbows, catching whiff of my approach, while I quiver in my uncontainable\nexcitement. We stare at one\nanother, marveling at how the years have not dulled my hair, or his smile, nor\nhas time melted away the longing in our eyes. How he still looked so handsome in\nhis union blues, light decoration abruptly severed.\nMemories flood my mind; I relearn my enemy-lover\u2019s name in the span of seconds. I had loved my enemy on sight. We did not pretend to understand how we could come to love one another in the midst of such hatred, only that we did. We\u2019d recognized something in one another that war could not steal or taint, something admirable and precious. It was a curious thing for us to succeed from our government and cling to one another and we played the game for the remainder of our time, defying our family, our state, our way of life. We would have defied our God equally as well. And perhaps we did.\nTwo weeks of splashing in the\nbloated streams that trailed the orchards, horseback riding over green fields\nwith not a care to the crops that he was to pilfer and then burn along with my\nfamily home. Hiding the century-old silver in the earth where he told me they\nwould not bother to look and, as far as I know is still there awaiting\nresurrection.\nThe memories cease their flow as I\nhear, in my soft-spoken voice, his name, as it escapes my lips just barely,\n\u201cAaron.\u201d\nThe last few steps are taken to the\nedge. There is no physical edge, only a mental one. I stop my progression,\nhalting so not to break the chain of certainty. We are allowed no closer\nproximity at this point. We stand frozen, as if waiting the next scene in a\nplay, not knowing our lines until we actually say them.\n\u201cI see you\u2019ve worn my favorite dress,\u201d he says, cocking his head to one side. It is his favorite quip, and most beloved by me\u2014who wears this tattered rag.\nI press the wrinkled muslin with my\npalms, faint blush and swelling of pride at his unwavering observance. It\u2019s\nthe same cornflower blue dress, albeit slightly cloudy with fade, and riddled\nwith nicks from the briars every year.\nI have something quick and clever to\nsay, but the opportunity is stolen by the marauding clouds that materialize\nwithout warning to cloak the sun. Without the sun to hold them back, the dark\nwinds appear, casting a sickly green to the air. The leaves escape from the\nbranches in panic and the bare limbs claw at the sky like arthritic hands.\nAs always, Aaron remembers these well-worn events a full second before I do.\nI totter over the edge of the great mental barrier, wanting to be close. He holds his hand up in mid air, stopping me, \u201cElena\u2026\u201d\nThe rush of memory is too\npainful\u2014too sudden after the elation of reuniting. The rip in my soul is wide\nenough to feel the air course through and its howl is electrifying. The undue\nreincarnation of raw, jagged\u2014ache. We were too quick to forget our\ncircumstances. Too foolhardy to believe that love could conquer vast divides of\npolitic. Love weaves its own spell, individually, as its haze covers the eyes\nand minds of those under its spell. Not those who view it afar from its\ninfluences, marred from the odium of other ghastly deeds.\n* * * * *\nThe Captain was an embittered man.\nWeary of death and loss as the ramifications of war had long tarnished and\nhardened him to granite. A figure of considerable clout, inveterate in the art\nof bending men to his will, in both body and mind and often spirit. And he had\nfound my lover and I under that magnolia tree sinning against both the Southern\nCross and Old Glory. Perhaps the thought that we may be right, seeing us as two\nhumans contradicted the murderous war he\u2019d partook of, and was too strenuous a\nweight to bear. By eradicating us, he authenticated the cause. Surely I will\nnever know.\nAaron had genially asked about his\nhealth and spirits, remarking how handsome the day was, without remorse, for we\nwere alive and:\nHad the war been declared a\ntruce?\nAnd shouldn\u2019t it very well be?\nOnly I noticed the astonishment\ntransform to rage.\nThe blast of thunder and the odor of\ngunpowder had wrecked the air. My Aaron crumbled at my feet, folding in on\nhimself, the black powder burns tattooing his back.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never killed a woman\nbefore,\u201d the Captain says, \u201cbut I can\u2019t let your traitorous acts go\nunheeded.\u201d He looked down at Aaron\u2019s gasping mouth with I can only guess: a\nsmall amount of remorse. \u201cThe way I see it, you lured him from his purpose.\nAll you Southern harlots, with your whining charm and coy intentions bent on\ngetting your own way. The lot of you has the very devil inside.\u201d\nHe lifted the pistol to my breast, hand slightly quivering. \u201cMay your devil keep you.\u201d\nAnother thunderous wail and smoke\nconverged, but the Captain never fired his shot. My Aaron, with his last act of\nlove spared me this. I wanted to tell him that it was no matter\u2014I could not go\non with out him\u2026but such a chivalrous deed struck a blank last chord in me.\nI denied the Captain a Christian\nburial, or any burial at all. My restless span of years can be contributed to\nthis fact I\u2019m sure.\nAaron was buried by loving hands under that showering magnolia, with its sentinel of huge limbs and fragrant ivory bulbs. I took the rope from the well pulley and secured it to that large limb, directly over my Love. From the limb I leapt, hearing the snap, the mossy grass rushing up to meet me but never finding my feet.\nThe memory plays out and I am left\nhollow with resolve.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I shout over the squall,\n\u201c please Aaron, I cannot wait another year. No longer can I wait for what is\nmine\u2014what I\u2019ve purchased with my suffering for over a century. Let us not\nretreat this time. Please, trust me. We can stop this now. I truly do not\nbelieve that there is a perfect sequence. We must go forward this time.\u201d\nAaron\u2019s gaze penetrates the\ngloaming, his lips slack in monumental sulk. Yet he says nothing, just gapes as\nthe gales beat us down, extinguishing the flames of hope with dread. Desiccated\nleaves swirl, leap, and whip at us, obscuring our vision. I tense expectantly,\nwaiting for the inescapable. Willing him just once to make a stand. But the\nstrands of conformity are too strong, the past\u2019s scarlet snare too hypnotic\nand eclipsing for him to see beyond a yesterday.\nI shudder, feeling his exit. Leaving\nme all alone to chose yet again: To fight or retreat in silence. But all\nvitality has left me with his departure. The memories fade to gray, as does the\nimage of his face. I turn my back to the wind and it stops its fearsome growls; It\nhas won yet again by beating us into submission and cowardice.\nAs I walk back to my home, my\nthoughts are heavy, the crook of our dilemma replaying over and over in my loose\nmind. What if there were variations to the twists and turns of every birth, in\nplace to quell what little rebellion remained in our soul? To allow us to think\nwe would conquer this\u2014that we were getting closer to the truth and freedom,\nand someday we would not have to follow the ritual at all, never pausing at the\nbarriers set out for us to impale ourselves upon.\nI\u2019m doomed to ponder our\ncircumstance another 364 days, and then doomed to forget my ponderous solutions,\nto yet again repeat the rebirth and death. Aaron has belief that one day we will\nget it right\u2014that God will smile upon us and say: \u201cPerfect\u2014come home.\u201d\nI scorn God. Not even in death do I\nreceive contentment. It is my conviction that we must fight the monster, and\nonly then do we proceed to the other side. One day I will convince Aaron of\nthis, I must.\nAs I follow the same path as before, I do not walk through the rose briar patches. I do not skip, or notice the honeysuckle or motes drifting in the air. I strike at the bothersome butterfly when it tries to make light of the situation by fluttering against my check, finally connecting my clenched fist to her fragile wings onto the hard stones\u2014for after all, there will be more butterflies. Past the withered and God-forsaken vegetables that I curse the rodents to find. Throwing the pail against the trees knowing it will roll to its side beyond the old oak tree; knowing I will become agitated further and remove it diligently to the alcove beside the door\u2014because everything must be just right. And for everything to be just right I must not look up. I must not see the majestic arches of unbelievable height or the exquisite carriages of metal that race through the air supported by faith alone.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20051003193024\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/janmar2002\/birthing.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The Internet's Premier Magazine of Historical Science Fiction","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/QE4bRdzhFV63axMoTNRLBdoTavY.json","volume":3.0,"issues":1.0,"has_text":true}

This, this is science!\u201d He waved a battered notebook, its leather cover stained almost black from use.\nLeeds replaced the volume on the lower south shelf and sat at his desk. He waved Little Billy to a chair, and as usual, he sat on the floor, disdaining any thought for his clothing or demeanor. A true man of science\u2026\n\u201cYou gents know I have an apparatus in my laboratory that captures etheric waves.\u201d Both men nodded, though they knew no such thing. \u201cOver the past week, I have been detecting waves of a different sort from the ordinary. Here, let me show you.\u201d\nHe bound to his feet with startling agility and waved Murchison over to Leeds\u2019 desk. The tall man said, \u201cWhy is your desk considered so much more important than mine?\u201d\nLeeds replied with an evil smile, \u201cBecause I keep mine neat, old chap.\u201d Murchison\u2019s eyebrow arched and he placed himself beside and out of elbow\u2019s reach of Little Billy.\nThe huge man was flipping through page after page of neat, almost ridiculously tiny script, in inks of as many colors as that in rainbows. \u201cWeather, wind speed, etheric waves, etheric\u2026Ah! Here it is. Beginning this past June 16th, at 3:54 past meridian Greenwich Time.\u201d Little Billy beamed with scientific pride.\nLeeds waited until Murchison perused the figures and then turned the notebook around for his examination. He and his partner exchanged a mild look, then Murchison took the lead.\n\u201cWhat are those numbers about?\u201d\nLittle Billy pulled the notebook back to the middle of the desk. His large, calloused and acid-stained finger pointed at every detail. \u201cThis column here is the time, set to Greenwich.\u201d Leeds\u2019 eyes rolled. \u201cThis column gives you duration of the signal. This one indicates rise or fall in pitch. This one calculates the length of the wave and this one its intensity. It\u2019s all very clear!\u201d More scientific pride bursting from an ox-like chest.\nThe phenomenologists stared at the indecently straight rows of little numbers and symbols.\n\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d\n\u201cWhat does it mean?!\u201d expostulated the mountain. \u201cIt means there are beings communicating with us through the ether, that\u2019s what it means!\u201d\nMurchison perched a hip on the desk. \u201cCommunicating? How do you figure that?\u201d\nLittle Billy was almost hopping with energy. \u201cLet me show you. The first signal was recorded here. Exactly six hours later\u2014mind you!\u2014the same signal is repeated. Six hours later, again. Then six and six more.\u201d His hand came up in a stopping gesture. \u201cNow the proof. Twenty-four hours after the first signal, the pattern drops to five hours and increases in intensity. See? Look here.\u201d\nBoth Murchison and Leeds leaned forward. The large finger slid down the page. They both nodded.\n\u201cThat goes on for thirty hours. Then, more proof. A signal every four hours and a higher intensity. And note that the signal is the same in length. Its only change is intensity.\u201d Little Billy took a deep breath and seemed about to float off into the ether. \u201cThe four hour interval goes on for thirty-six hours and then guess what happens next?\u201d\n\u201cA signal every three hours, with higher intensity,\u201d mumbled Leeds.\n\u201cYes!,\u201d cried the mountain and smacked Leeds so hard even Murchison winced involuntarily. Leeds tried hard to keep tears from his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the kind of thinking that Science needs! A signal every three hours and quite intense. And how long did that go on?\u201d His face was set in a professorial stare.\nLeeds couldn\u2019t have answered to save his life. \u201cForty-two hours,\u201d replied Murchison, his weight shifting back, just in case.\nLittle Billy deflated a tad. \u201cYou are right. The signal then appeared every two hours and was almost off my chart.\u201d He flipped a page. \u201cSee?\u201d\nLeeds\u2019 eyes had cleared. \u201cAnd when is the next change due?\u201d He cleared his throat, gently.\n\u201cYou are both true men of science!\u201d boomed Little Billy. \u201cGoing straight to the crux of the matter! The next change is due at\u2014\u201c\n\u201cThree fifty-four AM, Greenwich Time,\u201d ended Murchison.\n\u201cCor! That\u2019s a right gift you have there, Murchison.\u201d Little Billy looked duly impressed.\nA thought came to Leeds. \u201cWho do you think is sending this signal, if signal it is?\u201d\n\u201cOh it\u2019s a signal, all right. That it is. As to who is sending it, me mum says it\u2019s the spirits of the dead wanting to tell us what life is like over there.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what do you think?\u201d asked Murchison.\nLittle Billy\u2019s massive head dropped a few inches in fierce concentration. It rose slowly. \u201cSomething other than what me mum says,\u201d he replied judiciously.\nMurchison chuckled. \u201cBold scientific thinking.\u201d\nThe huge man twinkled. \u201cAre you joining me for the confirming moment?\u201d\nMurchison and Leeds shared a look. \u201cAre we needed?\u201d asked Leeds.\nLittle Billy became shy. \u201dIt would help confirm my findings.\u201d\nAnother exchanged look and dampened sighs. \u201cVery well,\u201d said Leeds, \u201cWe shall be at your laboratory at 3:30 sharp. Tea would be nice.\u201d\n\u201cSplendid!\u201d He clapped huge hands, making both men flinch. \u201cTea for three. And don\u2019t worry, me mum sleeps like the dead.\u201d He gathered his journal and raise and oratorical hand. \u201cTonight, Science will take a giant leap forward!\u201d he announced dramatically and swept from the office.\n\u201cDon\u2019t slam th\u2014\u201c The rest was lost in the crash of door and frame.\nCHAPTER II\nThe night was unusually damp for late June, with a creeping fog that lay in hollows and atop hillocks. The Mayfair\u2019s home was north of London proper, past the wretched slums of Irish and Scottish immigrants and nestled amidst the few small dairy farms that served the city.\nIn the quiet pre-dawn hours, Murchison and Leeds pulled their carriage up to the inner gate and secured the horses. The house, a sprawling structure more akin to a warehouse than a residence, was the legacy of Big Billy to his widow and only child. It was originally a two-room shack, and over the years, as Big Billy\u2019s business acumen paid handsome dividends, he added to the house as his fancy suited.\nWith careful steps, the men made their way around the house, to the southern wing, where Little Billy\u2019s sprawling laboratory was established. Not twenty feet from the door, another explosion.\n\u201cHullo!\u201d crashed through the night as the cock-eyed door bounced of a badly dented wall.\nMurchison and Leeds glanced back at the house.\n\u201cNo mind, my friends, no mind! Me mum\u2019s deaf when she\u2019s dreaming. Come in!\u201d\nThe men went in quickly, Leeds hanging back to go in last and thus save the door, wall and two sets of nerves from being assaulted again.\nThe laboratory was actually quite impressive with its array of scientific equipment, specimens and charts lying in slight disorder. Over there was a machine for measuring the presence of phlogiston, the original of which was in Paris. In the back, a long telescope pointed at heavens, its lenses, Leeds knew, having been ground in Geneva by the greatest lensmaker of all time. A capacitor sat beneath a heavy table, wires trailing from it to a terrarium filled with cacti. Two strange embryos floated in alcohol-filled jugs, their murky depths creating images of fearsome wonders.\nHigh on the wall, the large-faced clock showed hands at 3:32. Murchison and Little Billy were already peering shoulder-to-shoulder at a large machine.\n\u201cHere\u2019s where the etheric waves enter and reflect off of the inner surface, made of finely beaten copper. The sheet is so thin,\u201d continued Little Billy, \u201cIt actually moves visibly when the waves hit it.\u201d\nMurchison nodded judiciously. \u201cWhy do the waves only enter from this side? Have you tried moving the apparatus to point in other directions?\u201d\n\u201cYes I have, but the signal\u2019s strongest from this direction.\u201d\nLeeds peered upward, out the open window into the heavens above. \u201cWhat constellation does it point to?\u201d\nAll three men were silent. The topic had made its appearance. The silence grew oppressive.\n\u201cNone,\u201d replied the mountain, \u201cNone that I can see. It might point to any number of stars, though.\u201d\nAnother weighty silence. \u201cAre we not alone, then?\u201d asked Murchison, his voice thickened.\nLittle Billy started to say something, then refrained. Leeds went ahead. \u201cIf that is true, we may never have the chance to speak of what we learn here tonight.\u201d\nThe huge man made a fist. \u201cKnowledge was meant to be shared! If we have proof, then I say we tell the world and damn the consequences! The people must know!\u201d His nostrils flared, breaths coming and going with alarming speed.\n\u201cGently, partner, gently,\u201d said Murchison, placing a hand on wooden muscles. \u201cFirst we need the proof, then we can tackle the sceptics and metaphysicians.\u201d\nLittle Billy glanced up at the clock, and quickly explained the other features of his apparatus. He checked to see that the needles were inked, the paper stretched tautly and that the window was securely fastened. At the end of his preparations, the clock read 3:52.\nTwo minutes. Seconds dragging by, not because of dread or ennui, but because of the unknown, possibly unknowable implications. Each man in turn glanced at the clock, its soft ticking seemingly louder in the quiet hour when sleep is deepest.\nIt began as a mild screech, a crackling sound of metal scraping metal. Hen it rose in pitch, rising steadily, inexorably, until it was louder than anything else in that weird and wonderful room. Little Billy stabbed the air with his finger, pointing at the gauge that recorded intensity, as it reached its limit and then tried to go beyond, flickering desperately for more space.\nFourteen seconds after it started, it stopped, cut off like the victim of an unseen guillotine.\n\u201cJust as predicted!\u201d boomed the mountain. \u201cIt\u2019s a signal and it\u2019s getting clearer.\u201d\nLeeds shook hands, carefully, with Little Billy and Murchison, his face a concentrated frown, limited himself to a nod.\n\u201cWill you be publishing?\u201d asked Leeds.\n\u201cNot immediately, no,\u201d said Little Billy. \u201cFirst I have to record the expected changes after fifty-four hours and then\u2014\u201c He slapped his forehead with frightening intensity and his face became a mask of heartfelt sorrow.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Leeds, his voice arousing Murchison\u2019s attention.\n\u201cOh my blessed stars,\u201d said the huge rueful man, \u201cI didn\u2019t rig up a way to measure the signals components! There might be some valuable knowledge stored there and now, it\u2019s wasted! How could I be so blind?\u201d His shoulders slumped in despair.\nLeeds placed a hand on the man\u2019s shoulder, squeezing firmly. \u201cYou cannot think of everything,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWithout your foresight and diligence, we wouldn\u2019t even have this much. Work with what you have and leave something for the mere mortals to do afterwards.\u201d His smile was filled with genuine companionship.\nLittle Billy raised his head, caught the smile and meaning and stood straight again. \u201cThank you, old chap. You are right. There\u2019s still work to be done and then again,\u201d his big smile beaming again, \u201cI might find a method to analyze the signal anyway!\u201d His chuckle was massive and hearty.\nA few minutes later, after signing the journal and taking their leave, Murchison and Leeds rode back to the city. Their trip was quiet due to Murchison\u2019s reverie, virtually uninterrupted since the signal was heard.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s bothering you?\u201d\nMurchison made a brief gesture, and the ride continued in silence. A few minutes later he said: \u201cWhy is it getting louder?\u201d\nLeeds flicked the reins for a little more speed. \u201cYou believe it is a signal?\u201d\n\u201cYes, it has to be. It is too regular and predictable to be anything else.\u201d\n\u201cWho is signaling whom?\u201d\n\u201cWho or what, you might mean,\u201d countered Murchison.\n\u201cTrue. And your point is just as valid. We might know more after Little Blly completes his study.\u201d\nMurchison flicked a glance at Leeds. \u201cSomehow I think we\u2019ll need to know before then.\u201d\nThe word that flared and flamed in Leeds\u2019s mind was ominous.\nCHAPTER III\nTwo days had gone by, to be precise, forty-nine hours. Leeds had had his usual nightcap of cognac and water, finished a remarkable book about mesmerism and hysteria and was sound asleep with Abilene when a rough hand shook his dreams into oblivion and his heart into a hammering flutter.\n\u201cWhu\u2014wha\u2014huh\u2014\u201c He opened sleep-heavy eyes to see heavy eyebrows laden with concern.\n\u201cSssh\u2026It\u2019s me. Don\u2019t wake Abilene.\u201d\nLeeds rolled over carefully. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why are you here?\u201d\n\u201cI know why the signal is getting stronger.\u201d\nLeeds needed a few seconds to gain his bearings. \u201cThe signal? Little Billy\u2019s?\u201d\nMurchison nodded. \u201cGet dressed. Hurry.\u201d He strode out of the room, closing the door partially.\nIn the carriage, the mood was tense with speculation.\n\u201cYou say it\u2019s screaming?\u201d\nMurchison shook his head. \u201cNot literally. It started out normal and slow and is speeding up and getting louder. It\u2019s as if whoever or whatever is sending the signal has an increasing need to be heard.\u201d\n\u201cBut screaming for what purpose?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m willing to wager that Little Billy\u2019s notebook has the answer to that question.\u201d\nLeeds became even more puzzled. \u201cThat seems unlikely.\u201d\nA grunt. \u201cMaybe, but while reading through it, I noticed that the day before the signal started, he noted a flashing object that fell from the sky. In fact, he pointed his apparatus in the direction of that flash.\u201d\nThe carriage took a heavy bump and Leeds had to wait for his reply. \u201cThat could just be coincidence. It doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s a cause and effect relationship between the two events.\u201d\n\u201cGranted,\u201d replied Murchison, \u201cBut we know the signal is strongest along that same line and that is too significant to be a coincidence.\u201d His pause was short. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t shake the feeling that we are running out of time.\u201d\nThe ride continued without a word.\nLeeds knocked on the laboratory door and a muffled \u201cCome in\u201d was their invitation. The room now had a less scientific and more domestic smell, as plates of food, jugs and teapots lay scattered over several surfaces.\nNear the etheric wave apparatus sat Little Billy, his hair apparently charged with static, his face drawn and haggard and his eyes reddened with fatigue. Both visitors rushed to his side.\n\u201cGood heavens, man! You look thrashed!\u201d\n\u201cHave you been awake all this time?\u201d\nThe huge man smiled wistfully. \u201cHullo, Leeds. Hullo, Murchison. I am fine and yes, I have been monitoring the signals every hour on the hour. See?\u201d He raised his notebook, the straight neat lines becoming wobbly for the latest entries.\nLeeds took the journal. \u201dHas the signal changed?\u201d\n\u201cNo, still steady in time and intensity.\u201d\nMurchison prodded Leeds. \u201cOh yes, by the way, old man, didn\u2019t you jot down something here about a falling object?\u201d\nLittle Billy\u2019s face darkened. \u201cDid I tell you that?\u201d The two men\u2019s vigorous nods confused him. \u201cVery well. I saw a bright flash out that window, sometime before midnight and when I looked, a shooting star streaked into the ground.\u201d\n\u201cA meteorite?\u201d asked Murchison.\nLittle Billy raised and dropped his shoulders. \u201cDunno. I just recorded its passing and went back to calibrating my phlogistonometer.\u201d\nLeeds crossed glances with his partner. \u201cWhat made you point the etheric wave apparatus in that direction?\u201d\nThe mountain\u2019s face screwed up in concentration. \u201cSeemed the best thing to do,\u201d he said at last. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t picking up anything in any other direction.\u201d\nHis simple answer gave both men pause. Leeds glanced around and asked, \u201cDo you have a lantern we may borrow?\u201d\nTired, Little Billy waved at a nearby table. In a minute Leeds had the lantern lit and Murchison had found a shovel. \u201cWhere did the object land?\u201d said the tall man, leaning on the shovel.\n\u201cWhat? Uh, well, over by the doubled oak, about three hundred feet or so. Why are you going out there?\u201d\nLeeds replied, \u201cHave you already checked what\u2019s there?\u201d\nA massive head shaking slowly. \u201cNo. Not interested. I\u2019ve got plenty of chunks of metal here.\u201d\n\u201cWait here. We\u2019ll return momentarily,\u201d said Murchison and he led Leeds to the field.\nThey found it immediately, a large hole, cone-like, angled into the sod. With strong strokes, Murchison started digging as Leeds peered into the widening hole.\nAfter several minutes, Leeds cried out: \u201cThere! I see something!\u201d He passed the lantern and grabbed the shovel so Murchison could take a look.\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, there is something in there. Shiny gray, probably made of metal. Can you get it out?\u201d\nLeeds went to work. With deliberate strokes, he worked his way around the area until the object came up atop a small mound of dirt. It was definitely metallic, its sheen unmistakable. It was about ten inches long, a bulky oval with three long slight fins starting at about halfway up on the body of the object and extending beyond its edge about an inch. One of the fins was badly twisted, exposing a very narrow hollow interior that flashed a tiny red light.\nMurchison went to pick it up when Leeds stopped him, saying, \u201cCareful! We don\u2019t know what it can be.\u201d\nWith care, Murchison grabbed the shovel\u2019s blade and, lantern aloft, the two men returned to Little Billy\u2019s lab with measured steps.\nCHAPTER IV\nItalian jewelers were masters of instrumentation and Little Billy had some of their finest work at hand. Donning a pair of blazingly white cotton gloves, he enthusiastically began probing the discovered object.\n\u201cSee? This narrow groove runs around the middle of the object. I believe it was machined that way so that the two halves could be removed.\u201d\nMurchison\u2019s pipe was at full smoke, while Leeds handed Little Billy different instruments.\n\u201cThis edge here is ever so slightly higher than the one behind it,\u201d he said, peering through the largest magnifying glass anyone had seen. \u201cI wonder why it\u2019s warm.\u201d\n\u201cInternal combustion?\u201d asked Leeds.\nLittle Billy and Murchison shook their heads. \u201cMost likely its etheric vibrations are still affected by the shock of hitting the ground at such a high speed,\u201d said Little Billy.\n\u201cSo you believe this object does have a connection to your signals?\u201d asked Murchison, smoke rising aromatically like a cloud.\n\u201cWilliam of Occam\u2019s dictum, my friend,\u201d said the mountain, \u201cMakes a most excellent starting point always. Here, hand me the diamond cutter.\u201d\nLeeds did so, and applying the massive muscles of his forearm, Little Billy pressed deep into the groove, rolling the object slowly across the table. After two full circuits, the metal parted.\nAll three men were glued to the object. With surprising touch, Little Billy separated the two halves. The lower half, if only because of the fins, was hollow and with the help of the lantern, they peered inside. The tiny red light kept flashing, once a second. Suddenly, it stopped, then two red lights came on and stayed lit.\nLittle Billy showed the other two men the change. \u201cWhat do you think that means?\u201d\nThe phenomenologists shrugged.\nThe lower half was put back on the table and the upper half was picked up. This one was filled with a bluish-gray substance, like clay. Little Billy ran a forefinger over the surface, noting the slickness of its surface.\n\u201cFeels oily,\u201d he said. He looked at his gloved finger, noticing a tiny stain, like a ladybug\u2019s spot.\nThe knock at the door caused hearts to stop. All three men whirled to look across the laboratory at the door.\n\u201cCome in, mum,\u201d said Little Billy, his voice trembling a little.\nThe door opened slowly to reveal the figure of what appeared to be a man, in heavy cloak, a wide-brimmed hat that cast his face in shadows and, amazingly, mismatched boots. One was black and heavy, like a logger\u2019s boot, the other short and brown, as if belonging to a sailor.\nAn odd series of looks passed between the three men.\n\u201cMay I be of service, sir?\u201d asked Little Billy.\n\u201cI come for object.\u201d The voice was strange, as if crickets were chirping the words.\nRemoving his gloves, Little Billy stood up. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\nLeeds moved from behind the table and stood beside Murchison.\n\u201cI come\u2026 for object,\u201d repeated the figure in its strange whirring voice.\nLittle Billy placed the gloves on a small side table and advanced on the visitor. \u201cAnd which object would that be?\u201d His voice was edged sharper.\n\u201cThe object\u2026that fell.\u201d The figure didn\u2019t move, its face still in shadows.\nThe huge man crossed his arms and planted his feet wide. \u201cWhat makes you think I have such an object?\u201d he demanded.\nMurchison tapped Leeds\u2019 shoulder and they split, each taking a position about six feet from Little Billy on either side and slightly behind him.\n\u201cObject here,\u201d said the voice.\nNo one saw the smirk on Little Billy\u2019s face. \u201cAnd what would make me believe, kind sir, that you would be the owner of this object, if it were here?\u201d\nDead silence. The visitor didn\u2019t move. Then, the face came into view and curiosity gave way to bewilderment: The visitor\u2019s face was blank. It had no eyes, nose or mouth.\nHe must be wearing a mask, thought Leeds.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d asked Murchison.\nNo response. Then: \u201cTime is not now.\u201d\nMore looks flashed across the room. \u201cTime? Time for what?\u201d Leeds leaned closer to the visitor to watch his face.\n\u201cNo time,\u201d said the cloaked man. He took a few steps into the room. \u201cTime\u2026term not complete.\u201d His steps gained speed. \u201cObject must leave.\u201d\nLittle Billy advanced on the visitor, his massive bulk rising to the challenge.\nFor years afterward, Murchison and Leeds would argue just how far Little Billy flew. They watched as the two men came together in a bone-shaking crash and watched in awe as the huge man flew eight? ten? Feet away, crashing to the floor underneath the table with the phlogistonometer.\nThe visitor advanced towards the object and Murchison grabbed a heavy pole with a net attached to one end. Leeds moved around the tables to see the visitor face-to-face.\nLong on courage, Little Billy got up with a roar and leaped at the visitor. Grabbing him in a crushing bear hug, he tried to lift the masked man, only to grunt in surprise and pain as he found himself unable to even budge him an inch.\n\u201cLet go!\u201d cried Murchison and Little Billy pushed himself away as the pole swung at the visitor\u2019s head. A resounding crack was followed by the broken half of the pole hitting the floor. The wide-brimmed hat was knocked to the floor, revealing a smooth head devoid of any features.\nThe visitor never flinched. He reached for the object and Leeds grabbed him by the wrist. The visitor, surprisingly, allowed his hand to be stilled. Leeds felt a bitter cold in his hand and a distant thrumming.\n\u201cMust you take this object?\u201d\nThe smooth face made no motion, yet the voice emerged. \u201cYes. Now.\u201d\nLeeds stared for a few more seconds, then released the wrist. Quickly, the two halves were fit together and the visitor turned to leave. \u201cAll?\u201d he seemed to ask and raised the object. \u201cAll?\u201d\nMurchison dropped the broken pole. \u201cYes, it\u2019s all there.\u201d\nThe cloaked visitor left the laboratory, the sound of his mismatched steps the only noise. He turned at the doorway and repeated: \u201cTerm not complete\u2026soon.\u201d With that, he walked away into the night.\nCHAPTER V\n\u201cWhat the bloody blazes was that?\u201d coughed Little Billy, the fading power of excitement revealing the aches and pains he\u2019d received.\n\u201cI have no idea,\u201d replied Leeds, \u201cBut I hope I don\u2019t see the likes of him ever again.\u201d\nMurchison was fitting the two pieces of the broken pole together. \u201cI need to replace your lepidopterist seine,\u201d he said.\nLittle Billy waved it off. \u201cDon\u2019t bother, my friend, I am over my butterfly phase.\u201d He rubbed his chest and ribcage. \u201cI can hardly believe we just went through an experience like that.\u201d\n\u201cWell we did, and we probably have more questions than we\u2019ll ever have answers,\u201d said Leeds. \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d\nMurchison looked up at the clock. \u201cEarly breakfast?\u201d\nLittle Billy also looked at the clock. The carved hands stood at 3:50. \u201cAw, bloody hell. Look at that! Only a few more minutes and we would have had a chance to test the object with the signal.\u201d\n\u201cWe still have time for breakfast and to get you to bed,\u201d said Murchison. \u201cDoes that sound acceptable to you gents?\u201d\nLeeds and Little Billy chuckled their agreement and the three men left the laboratory for the main house, each in their own way seeking to spot their visitor.\nThey had just entered the main house and closed the door when the massive explosion rocked the foundations and slammed the door open, the windows shattering inward and a powerful wave of hot air crushed their bodies for an instant, tossing them like so many rag dolls against the far walls. Part of the house collapsed and the scream of a terrified woman, invoking the names of saints and Savior pierced the ravaged night.\nLittle Billy was the first to rise. \u201cMum! Mum!\u201d he yelled, racing like a crazed bear to the center of the house.\nMurchison arose next and knelt next to his partner. \u201cAre you injured?\u201d\nLeeds shook glass and splinters from his clothing as he sat up. \u201cA minor cut or two is all. And you?\u201d\n\u201cA few bruises. What happened?\u201d\nLeeds watch was dangling outside its pocket. He clicked open the face cover and, after a quick glance close to his eyes, he offered it to Murchison. The hands stood at 3:54.\nLittle Billy came back to the foyer with a tiny old woman in his arms. He set her down with loving gentleness and said, \u201cMum, these are my friends, Mr. Murchison and Mr. Leeds. They are two of the finest scientific minds in Europe.\u201d\nThe men bowed, Leeds having to rise to do so.\nThe old woman sniffed. \u201cYou the ones that blew up my boy\u2019s workshop?\u201d her tone was aggressive and whiny.\n\u201cNo, ma\u2019am, we\u2019re not sure what happened,\u201d answered Leeds, trying to straighten his clothes.\n\u201cWhat do you think caused that blast?\u201d asked Little Billy.\n\u201cTricks! Stupid tricks with magnetos and floji stuff. Them\u2019s dangerous tricks, boy, I told you a hundred times. Now what\u2019re you gonna do?\u201d She actually reached up and tugged his ear. He helped by dropping his head just enough.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, mum.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hard thing to lose all your work like that,\u201d said Murchison.\n\u201cIt could\u2019ve been worse,\u201d said Little Billy, his face upturned as if searching through the ceiling for stars.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Leeds.\n\u201cIt could\u2019ve taken the house and mum, too.\u201d She reached up and patted his cheek. He helped.\nThe morning wore on, what with breakfast and helping Little Billy salvage what he could. Which was nothing. The blast left shreds of objects; nothing was even close to being useful again.\nBack in their office, Murchison with his pipe spewing smoke and Leeds pacing the floor north to south, they had a brief exchange.\n\u201cIt had to have been the residue on the glove.\u201d\n\u201cBut, Leeds, the laboratory was pulverized. There couldn\u2019t have been more than a few specks of that material on the glove. How could so little do so much damage?\u201d\nLeeds paced even faster. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t the foggiest idea of how that could be so. But we can take Little Billy\u2019s word that there was nothing explosive in his laboratory.\u201d\n\u201cCapacitors explode.\u201d\n\u201cBut not like that.\u201d His pacing continued as a cloud of smoke oozed across his desk.\nMurchison spoke. \u201cThe message. You can\u2019t forget the message.\u201d\nLeeds stopped cold. \u201cNo.\u201d He resumed his pacing.\n\u201cWhen will our time be up?\u201d\nLeeds walked slower and slower until he stood still, next to Murchison. \u201cLet\u2019s hope not in our lifetimes.\u201d He placed a hand on the taller man\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s pray that it be never.\u201d","source":"Doc file","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"This is the second of the Murchison and Leeds stories written by Gil C.

His whole head\nthrobbed and each pulse of his heart sent fiery waves of pressure through his\nskull. It felt as if his head\nwas trying to explode. He struggled\nto open his eyes, but the first glimpse of light plunged needles of pain deep\ninto his brain and he squeezed his eyelids tightly shut once again.\nHe moaned in agony and\na cacophony of sound swept over him. The\nmeaningless rush of white sound overwhelmed him and he raised his hands to cover\nhis ears. As the noise slowly\ndiminished, he discerned distant voices amidst the din.\nHe held his breath and concentrated on what the voices were saying.\n\u201c\u2026see?\nHe\u2019s moving. He\u2019s awake,\nI tell you. Nurse, come here and\nbring my bag.\u201d\nJonathon peeked briefly\nout of one eye and, blinking against the harsh light, saw a silhouette of\nsomeone leaning over him. He\nrealized he was lying on his back and his hands were touching cloth instead of\nhair. Yes, his head was wrapped in\ncloth.\n\u201cCan you hear me, Mr.\nHansen?\u201d a gentle voice whispered loudly.\n\u201cDo you know where you are?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he replied,\ncringing at the volume of his own voice. \u201cI\u2026what\nhappened?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be\nall right,\u201d someone replied. \u201cYou\nwere in an accident.\u201d\nJonathon closed his\neyes once more and cautiously explored the cloth covering his head.\n\u201cLeave those bandages\nalone. You\u2019ll open the wound and\nstart bleeding again.\u201d\nSomeone took his hands\nand carefully, but forcefully, guided them to his chest.\nHe did not resist. He\nfocused instead on trying to clear the confusion that clouded his mind like\nthick cotton. It was hard simply to\nstay alert and to understand the voice.\n\u201cI am Doctor Wilkes.\nYou were brought here to the hospital after an accident.\nDo you remember falling? What\u2019s\nthe last thing you recall?\u201d\nJonathon struggled\nmentally. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he\nsaid. Nothing came to mind.\n\u201cNo wait, I was at the rally. I\u2026\u201d\nHe remembered the crowd in front of the courthouse and the red, white and blue\nbanners hung all around the town square.\n\u201cI was covering the\nmayor\u2019s re-election speech. Everyone\nin town was there.\u201d\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right\nand what were you doing there?\u201d the voice asked.\n\u201cI was listening to\nthe speech. I\u2019m a reporter here\nin town for the Kansas City Gazette.\u201d\n\u201cDo you remember what\nhappened next?\u201d\nHe tried to piece\ntogether the events from the jumble of pictures that flashed through his mind. \u201cI was up on a scaffold, trying to see the mayor.\nThere were\u2026 too many people in the square and I couldn\u2019t get close\nenough to hear.\u201d He\u2019d climb the\nnarrow platform of wooden planks workmen had used to drape all of the bunting up\non the lampposts for the election in two weeks.\n\u201cYes, and then?\u201d\nasked the doctor again.\n\u201cI remember writing\nnotes on my pad and\u2026 I must have stepped back off the scaffold.\nThe last thing I remember is falling and trying to catch myself.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d\nthe doctor said. \u201cYou hit your\nhead on a metal bench behind you. You\nsplit open your head pretty badly. Some\npeople nearby saw you fall and brought you here.\u201d\nJonathon nodded\nslightly and a new wave of pain exploded through his head.\nHe moaned and tried to will the room to stop spinning.\n\u201cAre you okay, Mr.\nHansen?\u201d asked the doctor. \u201cAre you experiencing great pain?\u201d\n\u201cJust...just my\nhead,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite\nunderstandable,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cI\u2019d\nbe worried if it didn\u2019t hurt. Can\nyou open your eyes? I want to check\nyour pupil response.\u201d\nJonathon opened one eye\nand squeezed it shut again. Someone\u2019s\nfingers pried open his eyelids and flashed a light in them.\nA moment later the intrusion was repeated on the other eye.\n\u201cGood,\u201d muttered\nthe doctor. \u201cBoth eyes are\nresponsive. Can you look here for\njust a moment. There\u2019s someone\nwho\u2019s been waiting for you to wake up.\u201d\nHe experimented taking\ntiny peeks with his eyes. With\nrepeated effort, the light became more tolerable and he distinguished some\nfigures near his bed. He\nfocused on the nearest and saw a woman\u2019s face, a woman with long blond hair.\n\u201cBeth?\u201d he asked. It was his fianc\u00e9, Elizabeth.\nThey were to be married next June. He\nblinked and her face gradually appeared though the haze that surrounded him.\nShe took his hand. It was warm and soft. \u201cOh,\nJon. You scared us so much.\nI thought you were going to die.\u201d\nHe squeezed her hand and smiled.\n\u201cActually,\u201d the\ndoctor said. \u201cWe thought you had\ndied. When they brought you in, I\ncouldn\u2019t even find a pulse. You\u2019d\nlost a lot of blood and your head was laid open like you\u2019d been hit with an\naxe.\n\u201cI was ready to have\nyou have you transferred down to the morgue when you went into convulsions. We had to tie you down and put a stick in your mouth so you\nwouldn\u2019t bite off your tongue.\u201d\nBeth interjected,\n\u201cYes, Jon. You gave us all a\nfrightful scare. You\u2019ve been\nunconscious for three full days. The\ndoctor said you were in a coma and you might never wake up.\u201d\nThe doctor leaned close\nand took his other hand to take his pulse.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, young man, but I\u2019ll have you know, she never left\nyour side. She\u2019s taken her meals\nhere and even slept by your bedside. You\nhave a good woman here, don\u2019t lose her.\u201d\n\u201cNow,\u201d said the\ndoctor. \u201cCan you tell how many\nfingers I\u2019m holding up?\u201d\nJohn peeked at the\ndoctor and blinked several times. He\nsaw the doctor clearly holding up a single finger.\nThen his vision blurred and he saw two images.\nNow one of them was holding up three fingers. A wave of vertigo swept over him that was so strong he\nthought he was going to vomit. Pressure\nsqueezed between his eyes as if he\u2019d done far too much reading.\nHe swallowed down the salty taste in his throat and closed his eyes once\nmore.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he replied. \u201cOne finger, three fingers\u2026 I can\u2019t tell.\nI\u2019m seeing double and the whole world is spinning.\u201d\nBeth squeezed his hand\neven harder.\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s also\nto be expected,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cYour\nimpact with the bench took a large chip out of your skull.\nYou have a small fracture and you\u2019ve suffered a very severe concussion.\nYou also have a subdural hematoma, that\u2019s bleeding in the brain.\nThere\u2019s a great deal of pressure on the inside of your skull.\nIt may subside on its own, but if it doesn\u2019t, your symptoms will worsen\nand we\u2019ll have to operate,\u201d\n\u201cOperate?\u201d he\nechoed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d\nthe doctor said. \u201cGiven time, the\nbody will heal itself and the pressure will diminish.\nWe\u2019ll keep you under observation for a few days.\nYour headaches and vision should improve as you get your strength back.\nJust concentrate on healing and rest.\u201d\nBeth left his side with\nthe doctor and he heard both of them whispering.\nBefore she came back, he drifted back to sleep and had strangely vivid\ndreams.\nJonathon spent another\nweek in the hospital. Beth arrived\nevery day and attended to him. His\nappetite came back with a vengeance and he greedily ate everything the nurses\nbrought him. The pain in his head\ngradually subsided, but his left side was weaker than his right.\nHe found he\u2019d unexpectedly drop things, if he grabbed them with his\nleft hand, and his first attempts at walking revealed a pronounced limp with his\nleft leg.\nHis vision also\ncontinued to trouble him. He\nfrequently experienced waves of double vision.\nOne moment, he\u2019d see Beth standing at the foot of his bed and the next\nhe\u2019d see several images of her, one still at his bed, another walking toward\nthe water pitcher by his nightstand, and a third moving to the window to adjust\nthe drapes. He\u2019d close his eyes\nand reopen them to find a single image once again.\nHe told the doctor\nabout his vision problems, but Dr. Wilkes just nodded solemnly and said,\n\u201cIt\u2019s the pressure on your brain. We\njust have to give it some time.\u201d\nOn the seventh day, the\ndoctor declared him fit enough to return home.\nJonathon took his time dressing. Beth\nbrought him a cane to help him steady himself when he walked. It was beautiful polished wood with a large gold handle at\none end and a flashy gold tip at the other.\n\u201cYou look very\ndistinguished with that cane,\u201d Beth said.\n\u201cNow, if I could only\nget rid of the limp,\u201d Jon replied. He\ntried to laugh, but found himself gritting his teeth as he stoically made his\nway down the hall. The week and a\nhalf of involuntary bed rest had left his legs weak and shaky.\nBeth steadied him with a firm grip on his right arm and, with her help\nand that of his new cane, he maneuvered his way to the hospital\u2019s front door.\nWhen he got to the\nsteps, he stopped to catch his breath and Beth stepped back gesturing grandly at\na fancy carriage parked out front.\n\u201cYour carriage\nawaits, milord,\u201d she said dramatically.\nThey laughed together\nand Jonathon waved Beth back as he carefully began his descent down the wide\nstone steps. At the carriage door\nhe paused and found himself gasping. He\nsurveyed the short distance he\u2019d walked and was amazed at how proud he was of\ncompleting such a brief trip.\nHe glanced around and\nmarveled at the beautiful morning sky. He\ninhaled deeply, savoring the smells and sounds of the day. You never appreciate simple things until you lose them,\nhe thought.\nTurning to enter the\nshiny black carriage, he glanced back and saw another vehicle parked nearby. The wagon was wide and tall, and was loaded with large wooden\nbarrels. One man attended to the\nfour large draft horses, while several others wrestled with the barrels to\nunload them. From the difficulties\nthey were having, it was apparent the barrels were quite heavy. They tipped one of the barrels on its side and it landed with\na resounding boom. One of the\nhorses bolted at the sound and the wagon jerked forward, knocking several men\noff their feet. The\nunattended barrel rolled off the back of the wagon and picked up speed as it hit\nthe ground.\nJon watched in horror\nas a woman in a long blue dress, passing behind the wagon, turned her head just\nin time to see the barrel\u2019s imminent approach.\nFor a moment Jon thought she\u2019d jump out of the way, but the woman\nmerely stared incredulously as the barrel hit her and rolled on.\nThe workers scrambled\nto their feet and rushed over to her, but it was too late.\nThe woman was dead. The\njuggernaut barrel accelerated as it rolled downhill until it hit a tree and\nburst open. Several men knelt down\nbeside the woman\u2019s body. The\nyoungest of the crew turned and began retching when he viewed the mangled body\nleft by the rampaging barrel.\nJon looked on in shock.\nHe grabbed the side of the coach as his vision blurred.\nThe tableau progressed\nin silence; no one knew what to do. Then,\nJon noticed a figure in the middle of the road.\nIt was a woman in a long blue dress.\nShe slowly stood and brushed herself off.\nShe looked back at the wagon and the crowd assembled there.\nThen she turned, placed her parasol over her shoulder and walked away.\nJon looked at the\nreceding figure and then at the ruined body near the cargo wagon.\nThe two women were the same.\nHe pointed in\ndisbelief. \u201cBeth,\u201d he\nstuttered. \u201cDo you see? Look at the other woman.\nShe\u2019s\u2026 she\u2019s\u2026\u201d\nJon started to explain,\nbut as he did, the woman with the parasol reached the other side of the street\nand faded slowly into transparency. In\na moment she was gone. He blinked\nin disbelief.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Beth asked. \u201cI don\u2019t see anyone.\nAre you all right, Jon?\u201d\nJon\u2019s face went pale\nand he fainted.\nWhen Jon awoke, Beth\nwas leaning over him and holding a moist cloth to his forehead.\nHe sat up slowly and looked around.\nHe recognized the parlor of Beth\u2019s widowed mother.\n\u201cHow did I get\nhere?\u201d he asked\n\u201cThe coach driver\nhelped bring you inside,\u201d she replied. \u201cNow\nyou just rest. Mother\u2019s preparing\nthe spare room upstairs. You\u2019re\ngoing to be staying here with us until you\u2019re stronger.\u201d\nThis is ridiculous,\nhe thought. I have my own\napartment and it\u2019s closer to the newspaper where I work.\nHe sat up and started to protest, but Beth interrupted him.\n\u201cNow, I\u2019m not going\nto argue with you, Jon,\u201d she said.\nShe waved the wet washcloth at him and scolded, \u201cYou\u2019re simply too\nweak to care for yourself. Why, if\nyou fainted and no one were around, there\u2019s no telling what harm you might\ncome to.\u201d\nBeth\u2019s mother\nappeared from the hallway with a stack of linen in her arms and stopped to look\nat them. Jon tried to rise, but\nBeth gently pushed him back down onto the sofa.\n\u201cYou stay there,\nyoung man,\u201d Beth\u2019s mother admonished. \u201cI\u2019ll\nhear no protest from you. I am not\ngoing to have my daughter\u2019s betrothed kill himself from exertion before\nshe\u2019s married. Now you sit there\nuntil your room is ready, and then you\u2019ll rest until dinner is prepared.\u201d\nBeth\u2019s mother spun on\nher heel and marched briskly up the stairs.\nJon blinked and looked\nup a Beth, who was once again standing over him, smiling demurely. Realizing he was outnumbered, he obediently lay back down on\nthe sofa and shuddered as he recalled seeing the dead woman\u2019s ghost.\nJon stayed at Beth\u2019s\nparents home for another three days before he decided to return to his job at\nthe paper. His strength returned\nslowly and he took increasingly longer walks each day with Beth.\nHe still suffered\nintense vertigo and frequent spells of double vision.\nThey talked about his vision of the dead woman\u2019s spirit that rose from\nthe street and disappeared into the air. They\nspoke of ghosts and life after death. Both\nof them wondered what the apparition meant.\nBeth listened patiently and was as troubled as Jon, if not for different\nreasons.\nOnce, on one of their\nwalks, Jon nodded at a man passing by. Beth\ngaped and told Jon there was no one there.\nJon watched silently as the man walked down the path and disappeared\naround a turn. Jon decided not to\nspeak of his visions anymore. Neither\ndid he tell her about the strange dreams that disturbed his sleep.\nWith exercise, and\nBeth\u2019s care, his limp became less pronounced and he hardly needed the cane\nanymore. Still, he looked thin and\nweak. He had dark circles under his\neyes and wasn\u2019t sleeping well.\nWhen Jon announced he\nwas going to return to the newsroom, Beth nodded and told him his boss, Mr.\nStelson, was most likely expecting him. Jon\nfinished his breakfast and went back to his room where he carefully removed the\nremaining bandages on his head. Deep\npurple bruises were visible near his hairline and around the large bald spot\nwhere the doctor had shaved his head to sow stitches in his scalp.\nHe gently placed a bowler on his head to cover his wound, took up his\ncane and walked briskly to the door. He\nkissed Beth goodbye and confidently strode down the sidewalk.\nDespite his recent\noutings, he was exhausted by the time he arrived at the paper.\nHe walked self-assuredly into the newsroom and was immediately greeted by\nhis fellow reporters. They shook\nhis hand and welcomed him back. He\nsmiled cordially, but rumors of his condition must have preceded him, because\neveryone treated him with deference and avoided the normal banter the younger\nreporters usually shared. At one\npoint, he had another bout of double vision as a copy boy raced toward him,\nseemed to split into two images that seemed to dash past him on both sides.\nJon closed his eyes against the accompanying vertigo.\nShortly thereafter,\nsomeone escorted him into Mr. Stelson\u2019s office.\nHis normally gruff employer subjected him to fifteen minutes of\nuncharacteristic small talk before he finally gave Jon an assignment.\nJon thanked Mr. Stelson for his time and hobbled out of the newsroom.\nHis task was to cover\nthe opening of the new branch bank a convenient two blocks away.\nThe sidewalks were\ncrowded and the streets were busy with a holiday atmosphere.\nToday was election-day and the town\u2019s elite were all was out doing last\nminute stumping. It was good to be\nseen up and around again, he thought. If\nhe\u2019d been gone much longer, everyone would think he\u2019d died.\nHe found himself slip effortlessly back into his reporter\u2019s mindset as\nhe mentally tallied who would be attending the bank opening and who he might\ninterview. The economic importance\nof the new bank made it a political event.\nHe grinned to himself as he anticipated the opening ceremonies.\nHe stopped at the\nintersection across from the bank and waited for the traffic to clear.\nNext to him were a group of schoolboys, free today because the schools\nwere closed. The clutter of\ncarriages, wagons and horses was unusually thick.\nSome of the boys darted through the congestion and managed to make their\nway across the street unharmed. The\nsmallest of their troop hesitated and found himself separated from his\ncompanions.\nJust then, Jon\u2019s\nvision blurred. The crowd before\nhim split and multiplied. It\nseemed there were far more people present than a moment before.\nHe looked down at the boy and saw him dash out into the traffic.\nOr at least he thought he did. He\nactually saw several boys. One made\nit across the street. A second\nfroze amidst the sudden rush of traffic and was trampled by a horse.\nGlancing down, he saw a third image of the same youth still standing\nbeside him afraid to brave the crowd.\nJon squeezed his eyes\nshut and opened them again. The\nmultiple images were gone and he saw only the single boy next to him.\nThe child\u2019s companions on the other side of the road taunted him and\ndared him to hurry across.\nAs the boy started to\nbolt toward them, Jon grabbed his collar with his strong right hand. \u201cWhoa,\nthere boy,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you\ntrying to get yourself killed?\u201d The\nmemory of the boy trampled under a carriage sent chills down his body.\nKeeping a firm grip on\nthe boy, he waved his cane to slow down an oncoming wagon and made a break in\nthe traffic. As soon as he did,\ntraffic halted and a number of pedestrians rushed across the gap.\nHe hobbled across the thoroughfare with the youth in tow.\nOnce safely on the other side, the street traffic resumed.\nThe boy wriggled free from his grip and disappeared into the crowd with\nhis companions.\nJon grabbed a nearby\nlamppost, as another wave of vertigo nearly overcame him.\nWhat just happened,\nhe wondered? Did I really\nsee a vision of that boy dying under a horse\u2019s hooves?\nDid I just save him or am I having hallucinations now, as well as seeing\nghosts?\nWith great effort, Jon\ncontinued the remaining distance to the bank.\nHe watched the ceremony without incident, except when he thought the\nmayor dropped the scissors he was using to cut the ribbon on the bank\u2019s new\ndoors. As his vision cleared once\nmore, Jon realized the mayor hadn\u2019t dropped the scissors after all.\nAfter the ceremony, he\nmade his way back to Beth\u2019s house without interviewing a single official or\ndignitary. When he got to his room\nhe collapsed on his bed and, exhausted, he quickly fell asleep.\nJon slept fitfully. Again he had strange, vivid dreams. Incompatible images of unknown, yet oddly familiar,\nplaces flashed through his mind. He\ndreamt of grand glass and metal buildings and saw the city grow to an\nunimaginable size. The next moment\nhe dreamt that the city was deserted without a single living soul within it.\nSomehow, all of the images were of Kansas City, yet somehow, none of them\nwere.\nHe saw the city\ndestroyed in a firestorm that burned and blackened every building.\nHe saw riots and war One\nmoment he saw crowds of friendly faces and, next, he watched armies of hostile\ninvaders in strange military uniforms slay everyone in sight.\nHe woke in a sweat,\nshaking uncontrollably. He limped\nover to the window and leaned on the sill, drawing deep breathes of the cool\nnight air. Everything seemed\npeaceful. Nothing outside was\nstrange at all. The night breeze\ncarried the sound of crickets across the serene, sleeping city.\nJon returned to bed, but took one of the sleeping draughts the doctor had\nprescribed for pain.\nJon lay back down and\nworried about his increasingly frequent hallucinations.\nAm I going mad, he thought? Am\nI losing my mind?\nHe listened to the\nchirping insects and waited for the doctor\u2019s tonic to take affect.\nIt seemed a long time, however, before the medicine dragged him down into\na dreamless slumber.\nThe next morning, he\nawoke late still dressed in the clothes he\u2019d worn the day before.\nHe washed, shaved and changed his suit.\nThen he headed downstairs to join Beth and her mother.\nBreakfast was over, but both of them were sitting at the dining room\ntable. They were talking in\nwhispers and stopped abruptly when he entered the room.\nBeth smiled, but her mother wore a worried expression she couldn\u2019t\nhide.\nHe sat with Beth while\nher mother rose and went into the kitchen to bring some food.\nAs he waited, he told\nBeth of the incident with the boy the day before.\n\u201cOh, dear,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cPerhaps we should go back to see Dr. Wilkes.\u201d\nJon hadn\u2019t meant to\nworry Beth. He decided to try to\ndismiss it. \u201cNo, that shouldn\u2019t\nbe necessary. I probably just over\nexerted myself,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter\nall, it was my first day back to work after all.\u201d\nBeth\u2019s mother came in\nwith a heaping plate of eggs and pan-fried potatoes.\nAs she started to serve him, she dropped her big serving spoon, spilling\nfood all over the floor. Jon leaned\nover to pick it up for her but, looking around, couldn\u2019t find it anywhere on\nthe floor. He peeked under the\nchair and raised the tablecloth to see if it had bounced under the table.\nHe started to get down\non his hands and knees when Beth\u2019s mother asked, \u201cWhat are you up to,\nJon?\u201d\nHe stood back up and\nsaid, \u201cI was going to pick up the spoon you dropped.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.\nJon blinked.\nStanding in front of him, she held a large steaming plate of food in one\nhand and her large serving spoon in the other.\nLooking around he saw no food on the floor at all.\nHe opened his mouth to explain, but Beth gasped.\n\u201cOh, Jon,\u201d she said\nputting a hand over her mouth. She\nlooked as if she were going to cry.\nWithout further\ncomment, he ate his food and, after the dishes were cleaned up, they left\ntogether to go back to the hospital to see Doctor Wilkes.\nThe doctor waved an oil\nlamp back and forth in front of Jon\u2019s face and watched Jon\u2019s eyes closely as\nhe did so.\n\u201cAre you having any\npain?\u201d asked the doctor.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jon replied. \u201cBut I keep having these intense waves of vertigo and\ndouble vision.\u201d\n\u201cHe sees things,\u201d\nBeth said.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said the\ndoctor, looking up.\n\u201cHe sees things. Ghosts, people who aren\u2019t there.\nYesterday he had a vision of the future and says he saved a little\nboy\u2019s life.\u201d\nFrowning, Dr. Wilkes\nturned to Jon. \u201cIs this true?\u201d\nJon nodded and lowered\nhis eyes.\n\u201cIs there anything\nelse?\u201d the doctor asked. \u201cHave\nyou been hearing voices? Have you\nhad any strange urges?\u201d\nJon shook his head. \u201cOh no, nothing like that.\nBut I have been having strange dreams, too.\u201d\n\u201cNightmares?\u201d Dr.\nWilkes asked.\n\u201cNo, not exactly. Just strange. They\u2019re\nwonderful and terrible, strange and familiar all at the same time.\nI don\u2019t know what to make of them.\u201d\nBeth looked shocked\nthat he hadn\u2019t told her about the dreams.\nJon felt suddenly ashamed..\n\u201cHmmm,\u201d said the\ndoctor. \u201cThis isn\u2019t good. Let me see that head wound again.\u201d\nHe poked and prodded at\nthe bald spot again. Jon flinched\nas the doctor pushed hard against Jon\u2019s stitches.\n\u201cJust as I\nthought,\u201d Dr. Wilkes muttered. \u201cThere\u2019s\nbeen more bleeding. The pressure on\nyour brain is increasing. That\u2019s\nwhat\u2019s causing these hallucinations.\u201d He\nsighed and sat on a nearby stool. \u201cJon,\nI\u2019m afraid we\u2019re going to have to schedule surgery to relieve the pressure.\nWhy don\u2019t I leave you two here while I go check on the schedule for the\noperating theatre.\u201d\nA nurse entered and\nescorted Jon to a nearby room. She\nthen instructed Jon to put on a hospital gown.\nBeth left the room while he changed and returned when he was sitting once\nagain in a hospital bed. The doctor\nsent them word that it would be several hours before preparations for surgery\nwould be complete.\nBeth\nwas silent. Jon didn\u2019t know what\nto say either. Shortly, he fell\nasleep once more.\nOnce again, he dreamt\nstrange dreams. This time, however, he dreamt of himself.\nIn one he had died from the accident and he witnessed his own funeral.\nIn another he was preaching from a pulpit in a crowded church.\nImages flashed before him of all the careers he might have chosen.\nIn one he was a policeman, in another a soldier.\nA third portrayed him as a successful writer.\nIt was as if all the choices he might have made long ago were being\nplayed out before him and all the different possible futures were being\ndisplayed.\nHe woke with a start\nand jerked upright. \u201cThat\u2019s\nit,\u201d he shouted.\nBeth, resting in a\nchair beside him, jumped up and hurried to his side.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked. \u201cIs\nsomething wrong?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Jon. \u201cI\u2019ve figured it out.\nI know what the dreams and visions mean.\u201d\nBeth stepped back,\nafraid.\nWith an\nuncharacteristic intensity in his eyes, he leaned forward and said, \u201cIt\u2019s\nchoices. The visions and dreams are all about the choices we make.\nYou see, every choice we make has different results, different outcomes.\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been seeing.\n\u201cYou know, the woman\nI saw? I didn\u2019t see her ghost.\nI saw a different outcome of the accident that happened.\nIn our world, the woman froze at the sight of the oncoming barrel and was\ncrushed. In a different reality,\nshe must have managed to throw herself forward onto the road and got out of the\nway.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see her\nspirit rise from her body. I saw a\ndifferent outcome. I saw what might\nhave happened, but didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cBut, how?\u201d Beth\nasked.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s the head injury.\nMaybe it affected my sight and let\u2019s me see these other realities.\u201d\nBeth bit her lip and\nshook her head sadly.\n\u201cNo, listen,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cIt all makes sense.\nRemember the boy. I saw all the choices he made.\nI saw him run and I saw him get trampled by a horse and die.\nI wasn\u2019t seeing the future. I\nwas seeing alternate presents. In\nour world, he was too scared to move. I\ndon\u2019t know if I saved his life or not, but I saw visions of what might have\nhappened, what would have occurred.\u201d\nBeth put her hand to\nher mouth.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you see? It makes sense. The\nman in the park that I saw and you didn\u2019t.\nHe was someone who might have taken a walk that night.\nYour mother\u2019s spoon at dinner. She\ndidn\u2019t drop it, but I saw that she might have.\u201d\n\u201cBut if you admit\nthese things didn\u2019t happen, then how could you see them?\u201d she asked.\nHe thought for a second\nand then smiled excitedly. \u201cIt\u2019s\nlike travelers walking together when they come to a turn in a road, a fork that\nbranches into two directions. While\nyou might take one path, your companion takes the other path.\nAt first the two paths are close and you can see the other traveler.\nBut as the paths digress, they get further away and disappear in the\ndistance. That\u2019s what it\u2019s like.\n\u201cI see these other\npaths for a while. The two\ndifferent realities are similar, but they get further away over time and get\nharder to see.\n\u201cMaybe that\u2019s why I\nhave the double vision so much. When\npeople make decisions, I see the other path they would have taken.\nIf the changes aren\u2019t significant, the two paths diverge and then\nrejoin. Only significant changes\ndiverge permanently.\u201d\nHe tapped his head. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be a result of the accident.\nIt changed how I see things and it lets me see other realities.\nThat even explains the dreams.\u201d\n\u201cThe dreams?\u201d\nechoed Beth.\n\u201cYes, see?\nWhen I\u2019m awake, the real world is clear and it blocks out the visions\nof other paths unless they\u2019re very close.\nBut, when I sleep, the images of the real world fade and I can see\nfurther. I can see more distant\nvisions of other worlds that might have come to pass.\nEach world is the result of different choices by the people in them.\nJust like we\u2019re the sum of all the choices we make in our lives.\nDon\u2019t you see, Beth? It\nall makes sense.\u201d\nBeth shook her head\nadamantly. \u201cNo, Jon,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense at all.\u201d\nJon looked around,\nfrustrated. Then his eyes gleamed\nwith excitement once more and he said. \u201cLook, Beth, I can prove it.\nWill you help me?\u201d\nBeth didn\u2019t reply.\n\u201cBeth, go get that\npaper,\u201d he said pointing at a table behind her. \u201cTear off two pieces and\nwrite a different number on each one, but don\u2019t show them to me.\u201d\nHe gestured for her to hurry. \u201cGo\non. Please, Beth.\u201d\nShe hesitated, then\nfinally turned and did as he asked. She\nplaced the two numbered papers on the blanket at the foot of his bed.\n\u201cGood,\u201d Jon said. \u201cNow pick up one of the papers and show it to me.\u201d\nBeth reached down,\npicked up the right hand paper and held it up.\nThe number, clearly marked was \u2018twelve\u2019.\nJon\u2019s vision blurred\nand split. As Beth held up the\nfirst paper, he clearly saw another Beth, reach down and selected the other one.\nThe other piece of paper showed a different number.\nHe closed his eyes and rubbed the bridge of his nose.\nWhen he reopened his eyes, only a single image of Beth remained, holding\nup the number twelve.\n\u201cThe other number is\nthirty-seven,\u201d he said.\nBeth\u2019s eyes grew\nwide.\n\u201cGo ahead, show me. Show me whether I\u2019m right or wrong.\u201d\nWith a horrified\nexpression on her face, she slowly turned over the second sheet of paper and\ndisplayed the number written there. It\nwas \u2018thirty-seven\u2019.\nJon\u2019s grin grew and\nspread across his face.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a magic\ntrick,\u201d she said. \u201cYou peeked\nat it somehow.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jon insisted. \u201cI saw two Beth\u2019s pick up and show me both sheets of\npapers. One was you and the other\nimage I saw showed what you might have done.\nIt\u2019s not a trick; it\u2019s a gift.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d\nsaid Beth throwing down the papers. \u201cIt\u2019s\na curse. No one should have\nsuch powers. It\u2019s like reading\nsomeone\u2019s mind.\u201d She backed\naway wringing her hands.\n\u201cBut, Beth, think of\nall the good I could do. I could\nfigure out what choices are right and wrong beforehand and help people.\u201d\n\u201cYou could also let\nthis madness control and consume you,\u201d she insisted.\n\u201cYou could use it to cheat at cards or steal other people\u2019s money.\nYou could become a swindler, a thief, and a charlatan.\u201d\nJon pursed his lips.\nHe hadn\u2019t thought of that. Great\npower also brought great temptation. Who\nknew what opportunities and temptations he might succumb to in the future?\n\u201cIt\u2019s too\nimportant. I have to find out more\nabout this new ability. I have to\nlearn how to control it.\u201d\nBeth raised her hands\nto her face and tears started streaming down her face.\n\u201cMy God, you\u2019ve gone mad,\u201d she said.\nJon realized he had a\ndecision to make. The doctor would return soon and he had to figure out whether\nor not he was going to submit to the surgery.\nHe looked at the terror on Beth\u2019s face and realized that if he didn\u2019t\naccept the surgery, he\u2019d probably lose her.\nOn the other hand, look at what he could gain. If\nhe learned to control his powers, he might win her back over time.\n\u201cPlease, Jon,\u201d\nimplored Beth. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me\nyou\u2019re reconsidering the surgery. The\ndoctor said if he doesn\u2019t relieve the pressure on your brain, you could\ndie.\u201d\nThere is that, too,\nthought Jon. Will I be placing\nmy life at risk if I delay?\nHe worried for a moment\nabout which alternative was best. Which\nchoice he should make?\nThen he laughed out\nloud. He didn\u2019t have to choose at\nall. No matter which option he\npicked, the other possibility would still exist.\nReality would split and he would somehow walk both paths. From a larger perspective, he would ultimately do both\nanyway, merely because there were two options he could take.\nWith that realization,\nhis vision doubled once again, and a now familiar wave of dizziness washed over\nhim. When his vision cleared, he\nsaw new figures in the room.\nHe saw himself rise\nfrom the bed, walk to the nightstand and pull on a pair of pants.\nHe watched as his identical image argued with another Beth and saw her\ngasp and run from the room. He knew\nthen, that he would stay and have the operation, and that his other self would\nventure on alone and to explore his new ability to examine alternate realities.\nJon would have the\nsurgery and remain here with Beth. His\nother self would face new, more dangerous challenges alone.\nAs he studied his\ncounterpart, Jon was shocked as the figure turned toward him and winked.\nHe can see me,\nthought Jon. Then he laughed and\nthought, but of course he can. He\ncan see me just as clearly as I can see him.\nFor a moment, the two Jon\u2019s looked at one another across the gap that\nseparated their two worlds. Then\nthey simply nodded to one another and exchanged an unspoken wish for good luck.\nJon sat in his hospital\nbed as his other self picked his coat and walked away.\nAfter the other had\ngone, he noticed his own Beth once more, staring at him with a look of horror on\nher face. He smiled and stretched\nout his hand to her. She walked to\nhis side and held his hand with uncertain desperation.\nDr. Wilkes arrived\nshortly with nurse who pushed a metal gurney with noisy rickety wheels.\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cThe operating theater is\nset up. The nurses and doctors are\nassembled and everything\u2019s prepared.\u201d He\npaused and looked at the troubled expression on Beth\u2019s face. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d he asked.\nBeth looked at Jon, her\nunasked question displayed on her face.\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Jon. \u201cEverything\u2019s all right.\nWe\u2019re ready. Just do your\nbest.\u201d\nBeth sighed in relief\nand squeezed Jon\u2019s hand tightly.\nJonathon climbed out of\nbed and up onto the gurney. An\nattendant tucked sheets around him to cover him and then wheeled him down the\nhall. Beth walked alongside the\ngurney and gave him one quick kiss before he was taken through the large doors\nof the operating arena.\nAs he lay in the\nbrightly lit room, he wondered. Did\nI make the right choice? What would\nthe outcome have been if I\u2019d chosen differently?\nWhat would happen now? Will I even survive the surgery?\nSuddenly he laughed. Of\ncourse, I\u2019ll survive, he told himself.\nAs long as there\u2019s a chance, there\u2019ll be some reality in which I\nsurvive. In some, I\u2019ll die. In\nothers, I won\u2019t have the operation at all.\nIn some possible futures, I\u2019ll use my powers to do great good.\nIn more distant worlds, I might cause great harm.\nThey were all equally valid realities, after all.\nJon closed his eyes and\ntried to relax. Soon, someone\nplaced a cloth mask over his mouth and began pouring liquid onto the mask.\nAs the ether fumes\novercame him, he drifted into a deep sleep and gently drifted through visions of\nwhat might have been.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20051003193024\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/janmar2002\/turn.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The Internet's Premier Magazine of Historical Science Fiction","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/AS8aXKflP2WoiCI9XDhvkz4qt7E.json","volume":3.0,"issues":1.0,"has_text":true}

This did not surprise him;\nRaymond was compulsively late.\nAs he walked slowly down\nthe platform, Charles extracted Raymond\u2019s letter from his\nvest pocket and read it over again. It was a very odd letter,\nhe thought. Raymond was a scientist; he had never been\na religious man. Yet his missive, inviting Charles to Cheyenne,\nwas filled with excited talk of a mystical awakening. Charles\nwondered whether grief and life alone on the windy Western\nprairies had affected his brother\u2019s mind.\nCharles checked his pocket\nwatch, then walked around to the front of the Union Pacific\nstation. He stood for some time, hands stuffed in his pockets,\nadmiring the building\u2019s imposing sandstone facade.\nEventually, Raymond pulled\nup in his new Buick automobile. He looked healthy, happier\nthan when Charles had seen him off in Pennsylvania, five\nyears before. The two men gave each other a back-slapping\nembrace.\n\u201cLife out west seems to agree\nwith you, brother,\u201d said Charles.\n\u201cYes, my constitution and\ndisposition are both much improved. The skies are clear\nand my melancholia seems to have blown away with the wind.\u201d\nRaymond heaved Charles\u2019 valise\nin the back seat of the car. They motored off down the\nLincoln Highway toward the edge of town, the summer sun\nhanging low in the sky behind them.\n*\n* * * *\nThe setting sun cast an orange\nglow on the impressive array of clerestory windows that\nlined the facade of Raymond\u2019s Victorian home. The men stepped\ninside and wiped the mud from their shoes. They removed\ntheir hats and moved to the parlor.\nCharles politely refused\nan offer of dinner. He patted his rather corpulent belly\nand announced that he was quite full, thank you. He had\neaten on the train.\nRaymond enticed him into\njoining him for a snifter of brandy. The two men sat comfortably\nin red leather chairs, nursing their drinks. The ceiling\nfan made lazy circles above their heads. As the sun finished\nits slow descent into twilight, cricket noises began to\nreach them through the open windows of the parlor. Raymond\nlit a cigar, and offered one to Charles, which he refused.\nThe men sat in silence for\na while, then Charles asked, \u201cIs it too early in my visit\nto inquire about your mysterious mystical experiences?\u201d\nRaymond chuckled.\n\u201cI see my letter intrigued\nyou, brother. I am not sure I would describe my experience\nas mystical. It was more like a--broadening of my scientific\nviews.\u201d\nCharles nodded.\nRaymond sighed. \u201cAll right,\nthen, I will tell you everything. But what I am about to\nimpart to you is in strictest confidence. You will be the\nfirst to hear the whole story.\u201d\nCharles leaned forward.\n\u201cI assure you, brother,\u201d he said, \u201cthat I shall share your\nsecret with neither the War Department nor with Doctor Hoodoo.\u201d\nCharles managed to keep a\nstraight face for a moment, then the two men burst out laughing.\n\u201cDoctor Hoodoo\u201d was an old joke between them, an invented\ncharacter left over from childhood.\nAfter the laughter died down,\nRaymond said, \u201cYou are no doubt aware of my long-standing\ninterest in the field of anatomical science. Over time,\nI have also developed an intense interest in abnormal psychology,\na la William James. A sort of...fascination with mystical\nexperiences.\u201d\nRaymond paused for a moment.\nCharles waived his glass\nat him. \u201cGo on.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I was thinking of\nwhere to start. With Dr. Krumholz, I suppose. Before I\nmoved out west, I worked with Krumholz, an alienist who\nhad developed some interesting ideas about the relationship\nof brain structures to particular mental illnesses. One\nof our projects was a study of epileptics. In one variant\nof the disease, sufferers become extremely religious and\nare subject to almost daily mystical experiences of a most\nprofound character. Dr. Krumholz theorized that this religious\npreoccupation was the result of a disorder in the right\ntemporal lobe of the brain.\u201d\n\u201cMmmm. Sort of like studying\nPhrenology, then?\u201d\n\u201cOh, good lord, no! I regard\nthat -- \u2018science\u2019 as one step above witch-doctoring, Charles.\nNo, this was something more. Something I resolved to test...something...\u201d\nRaymond paused for a moment,\nthen seemed to reach a resolution. He hopped to his feet.\n\u201cMay I show you my laboratory?\u201d\nhe blurted.\nCharles laughed. \u201cCertainly.\u201d\n*\n* * * *\nThe two men descended down\na long set of wooden stairs to the basement. The large\nunderground laboratory was cluttered with machinery of every\ndescription: chemical, electrical and mechanical. Raymond\ndrew Charles\u2019 attention to a plain-looking, dust-covered\ntable in front of a solitary chair near the center of the\nroom.\nOn a wig-stand on the table\nsat a battered leather football helmet. Attached to its\nright side, like some grotesque tumor, was a large metal\ndisc. It was connected to a heavy cable that ran to an\napparatus with dials and meters.\n\u201cCare to hazard a guess as\nto the function of this device?\u201d asked Raymond.\n\u201cMmm...a humane method of\nexecuting criminals, perhaps?\u201d\n\u201cNot even close. This, dear\nbrother, is a device for electro-stimulation of the right\ntemporal lobe of the human brain. The electromagnet on\nthe side of the helmet is wired to an oscillator and potentiometer\nthat controls the volume and frequency of electromagnetic\npulses routed to the helmet.\u201d\nCharles raised an eyebrow.\n\u201cAnd it does what?\u201d\n\u201cFantastic things. Unbelievable\nthings! I used the device on students recruited from the\nUniversity in Laramie. I swore them to secrecy, of course.\nOnce I developed a sense of the proper frequency, a significant\npercentage of those who donned the helmet and received electromagnetic\nstimulation described mystical experiences that went far\nbeyond my wildest expectations. A pervasive sense of the\npresence of . . . a Being beyond description, a perfectly\nloving, all-powerful Being!\u201d\n\u201cGood lord! You mean you\nshocked people into seeing God?\u201d\n\u201cIn a manner of speaking,\nyes. But the experiences my subjects described were among\nthe most meaningful of their entire existence. In fact,\nsome of them became quite angry with me when I afterwards\ndescribed the scientific basis of the experiment.\u201d\n\u201cAnd this is the basis of\nyour newfound faith?\u201d\n\u201cOne of the bases. Merely\none.\u201d\n\u201cMost remarkable.\u201d\n\u201cYes. Let\u2019s go back upstairs,\nshall we?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Charles, holding\nthe helmet, \u201cYou are not asking me to try the device? I\nhave a promoter friend in Chicago. With proper exploitation,\nyou know, you could make good money with this device...\u201d\nRaymond grasped his brother\u2019s\narm. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said.\nCharles looked at him quizzically.\n\u201cThis is not something to\nbe trifled with. Not with what I know now.\u201d\nCharles saw the look in his\nbrother\u2019s eye. He shrugged, and placed the helmet back\non its stand.\nThe two men climbed the stairs\nand wandered through the kitchen back into the parlor.\n*\n* * * *\nWhen they were seated again,\nRaymond said, \u201cI told almost no one of my experiments with\nthe temporal lobe device. The one exception was Dr. Greeley,\na physician who shared many of my interests. When I related\nthe results of my experiments to him, he related to me in\nturn the story of a most remarkable patient of his, a Mrs.\nCowper. It seemed this lady had fallen into an icy lake\nand drowned, but had unexpectedly revived after he had pronounced\nher dead.\u201d\nRaymond sipped his brandy.\nCharles thought of Raymond\u2019s\nwife, Opal, dead these six years from scarlet fever. It\nsuddenly occurred to him that perhaps this whole religious\nhugger-mugger related somehow to her death. As a lawyer,\nhe had seen similar effects among young women who had lost\na child. Sometimes, they turned to the church, sometimes\nto spiritualism...\nRaymond continued. \u201cMrs.\nCowper provided my friend with the most astonishing tale\nof her experiences post mortem, which I later confirmed\nwith her personally. In the few minutes she was medically\ndead, she claimed to have entered into the presence of a\nBeing similar to that described by my temporal lobe subjects!\n\u201cI began to wonder: could\nthe right temporal lobe of the human brain function as a\nsort of wireless transmitting and receiving device, connected\nto an unseen spiritual dimension? This would explain both\nthe impressions received by my subjects and their sense\nof leaving their physical bodies. It might also explain\nother psychic phenomena.\u201d\n\u201cExtremely difficult to prove,\nthough, I would think.\u201d\n\u201cAh! Yet I determined it\ncould be proved. If a subject could be brought to the brink\nof death, until the very point when the electromagnetic\nenergy departed his brain through the right temporal lobe...Measuring\ndevices connected to his skull would capture the out-flux\nthat occurred at the moment of physical death!\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds like a horribly\nrisky experiment.\u201d\n\u201cIt was! In December of\nlast year, my assistant strapped me to a table in my laboratory\nand injected me with a concoction of curare and certain\nother plant extracts that I had developed and refined.\nAs I lost consciousness and headed toward a twilight state\nof semi-death, he activated the machinery designed to detect\nany electromagnetic energy emitted by my brain. His instructions\nwere to inject me, eight minutes later, with a second syringe\nfilled with chemicals that I hoped would restore me to life.\nI left behind a note explaining my experiment in case I\ndid not revive and the police became involved.\u201d\n\u201cGood lord!\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened next was absolutely\nincredible. I sensed myself (my soul, if you like) separate\nfrom my physical body and enter a dimension beyond our own.\nI passed through a veil of sorts, then through an illuminated\ntunnel. I saw my entire life, from beginning to end, run\nthrough my mind like some motion picture, speeded up to\nan incredible velocity. Then, I encountered the Being of\nLight, the same being experienced by my patients and Mrs.\nCowper!\n\u201cAs I stood in its presence,\nI realized that I had been trifling with something that\nstood as far above me as I above a paramecium. At the same\ntime, I experienced an intoxication beyond intoxication,\nthe de-souling of my soul; the melting away of all the dross\nof my existence...\u201d\nSuddenly, Raymond\u2019s lower\nlip began to tremble. He fought back tears. Charles, embarrassed,\nstudied the laces of his shoes.\nAfter a moment, Raymond regained\ncontrol of himself, and continued.\n\u201cThe Being disappeared from\nview. I stood in utter emptiness for what seemed like several\nminutes, still treasuring my experience of the Being of\nLight. Then, another being appeared. This creature was\napproximately my height, but grotesquely reptilian, slithering,\ncovered in scales.\u201d\n\u201cFirst God, and now the devil,\neh?\u201d\n\u201cMy thoughts exactly, at\nfirst. But then, to my astonishment, the large lizard-man\nopened his mouth and spoke to me in a raspy voice. He said...\u201d\n\u201cYes, go on.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d\nRaymond got up and strode\nacross the room to a roll-top desk. He rummaged inside\nthe desk for a moment, then extracted a notebook. He flipped\nthrough the notebook and handed it to Charles.\n\u201cThis was my rather feeble\nattempt to write a short story concerning my encounters\nin that other dimension. It would please me very much if\nyou would read it.\u201d\nCharles began reading on\nthe second-to-last page.\n*\n* * * *\nThe lizard-man then addressed\nme with the following, unforgettable words.\n\u201cMan of Earth, I am a scientist,\njust as you are. During my lifetime, I inhabited a world\nso far removed from your own that it requires light many\nthousands of years to travel between them.\n\u201cThe sun around which your\nworld revolves is one of many billions of such suns. They\nare arranged in a giant, spinning disc which revolves around\na dark core. There are billions of such discs in the universe,\nplaced at incalculable distances from each other, each containing\nbillions of suns.\n\u201cAn uncountable many of these\nsuns support worlds containing intelligent beings. Each\nof these intelligent beings, though vastly different in\noutward appearance, has been constructed with a brain capable\nof storing vast warehouses of memory.\n\u201cUpon the death of an intelligent\ncreature from any of the inhabited worlds of the universe,\nchemical changes in the brain trigger a burst of radiated\nthought that travels, as you have conjectured, to a repository\nin another dimension. This transmission contains the very\nessence of the person, all his thoughts, memories, dreams,\nreflections. These essences are stored in the extended\ndimension, until the entire experiment that constitutes\nthis universe is complete.\u201d\n\u201cBut what is the purpose\nof this experiment?\u201d I asked, astonished.\n\u201cThink of your own experiences\non your planet,\u201d the creature replied, \u201cYour world is beautiful,\nbut full of suffering. There is much good, but also much\nevil. This present cosmos represents the best conceivable\ncreation possible for the Creator, within the current stage\nof his development. It is his own desperate experiment,\nan attempt to reconcile the conflicting forces within himself.\n\u201cAt the end of time, all\nthe souls stored in electromagnetic form will be replaced\nwithin a electronically simulated environment for a final\nbattle. There will be a conflagration between the forces\nof good and evil beyond anything conceivable to the mortal\nmind. The simulation will fill an entire universe, convulsed\nwith a war beyond all imagining. The result of this experiment\nwill finally resolve the inherent conflict between good\nand evil and will permit the Creator to move on to the next\nstage in his development.\n\u201cNow, my friend, it is time\nfor you to return to your world. I hope to see you at the\nlast battle, fighting with me on the side of the Good.\u201d\nThe creature raised a clawed\nhand in final salute, and with that, I felt my soul jerked\nrudely out of the realm of light, back toward my body.\nI traveled through the etheric realms, falling endlessly,\nuntil my soul in flight came to an abrupt halt.\nI could sense nothing but\ndarkness. Then all was gray twilight for some time. My\nhearing was restored first; I heard all around me the steady\ndrone of my laboratory equipment. I felt a crackling, a\nwild discharge of electricity through my skin.\nI heard from some distance\nthe voice of my assistant, crying out, \u201cIt is no use! He\nis lost! He is lost!\u201d\nGradually, I sensed my life\nforce once more beginning to animate my physical body.\nI felt exceedingly weak, fitting for one who had died and\nbeen resurrected. I slowly opened my eyes.\nThe first thing I saw was\nmy assistant\u2019s face. A tear coursed down his cheek.\n\u201cAlive!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cProfessor,\nyou are alive!\u201d\n*\n* * * *\nAfter Charles finished reading\nthe tale, the two men sat, utterly silent, for a moment.\n\u201cI suppose I cannot aspire\nto be the next H.G. Wells...\u201d Raymond said.\n\u201cNo. No. Your story is\nastounding, truly astounding. Forgive me, dear brother,\nI was thinking...I was thinking that, I am afraid it does\nnot quite disturb my agnostic stance. The problem for me,\nyou see, if that this is an entirely subjective account,\ndelivered under extraordinary circumstances. Once could\nbe excused for assigning your experiences to the same realm\nas dream. \u2013 Albeit a very realistic dream, I am sure.\u201d\nRaymond sighed. He nodded.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cIt is for\nthat reason that I have never published an account of my\nexperiences. That, and the fact that my instruments registered\nno electro-magnetic pulse upon my death. Without hard data,\nwho would believe me? Other than the followers of Madame\nBlatavsky, perhaps.\u201d\nRaymond gave a bitter little\nlaugh.\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, rising from\nhis chair, \u201cEnough of that. It is dark now, and our Western\nskies are extraordinarily clear this time of year. Would\nyou care to join me outside on the back porch?\u201d\nThe two men walked outside,\nand stood underneath the star-rich heavens. A gentle night\nbreeze caressed their faces.\nCharles looked upward at\nthe stars. Thousands of them winked down at him. He considered\nthe impossible distance the light must have come to reach\nhis eyes.\nCould it be, he wondered,\nthat even now, that a billion worlds surrounding a billion\nstars were teeming with creatures living, breathing, loving,\ncrying, suffering, fighting, dying...all preparing their\nsouls for an ultimate combat at the end of time?\nThough he could not quite\nbring himself to believe it, the thought that his brother\nmight have caught a glimpse of Ultimate Truth filled him\nwith an awe beyond words.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050727004221\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/octdec2003\/deathwave.htm","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/+sStjPOXDwIu6zN9vNIJz9SgiNI.json","volume":4.0,"issues":4.0,"has_text":true}

I have trouble formulating words to describe it: even the word \"selected\"\u015aonce vestigially implying the grace of a divine elector even in its casual uses\u015ais shaded over with a new resonance that insists on the blind\u015apossibly even mischief-bearing\u015aagency we are now bound to ascribe to the background forces that shape our world.\nWhen I was a man of twenty-eight I encountered the arguments of science and reason at Cambridge, and threw off with youthful asperity the Christian superstitions upon which I had been suckled by my parents, like every other Somerset schoolboy of the 1810s and 1820s. I stood my ground as an atheist in the Millsian line for forty-five years, even when that position came to be unpopular. Even when the legion of Oxfordians leapt headlong into popery, and its English weak-tea versions; even when Mills the younger, emaciated by his father\u013as cold philosophy, dabbled his toes in the mysticism of Coleridge and left the more consistent adherents among his friends looking less than human, I didn\u013at falter. I am not a sentimental man, and although I was an amateur, I was girded round by my collegemen who were scientists and academicians. I insisted on the introduction of new evidence worthy to make me adjust my position, not a mere fad of nostalgia and vestigial medievalist fancy.\nTo be sure, I would have found it comforting to have had the arid plain of reason washed over by some new miracle; to have witnessed some new evidence of divine presence, especially as I entered the last portion of my years. Why would I not have savored proof of an afterlife, in which to be eternally with my late, beloved Anne, and my children, to spend eternity together? I have been a good English citizen, and have no more to fear of hell than my next neighbour!\nBut now that I have seen evidence to contradict what we have all thought, it does not at all support this pretty tableau. I do not know what it confirms, except that hell might not be so unlike our own world as we have so far dreamed. Perhaps it is towered over ominously by something like our own twisted trees and factory chimneys, and perhaps the ground writhes with our own iron tracks and creeping vines. Perhaps Milton was right, and Hell preserves the finest advancements made by man in the line of death-bearing, using them as yet more means to extract from us our eternal agonies. Perhaps to refine the invention of these means to a pitch of efficiency was the entire point of man.\nThe setting for the strange events I am about to describe is my ancestral estate near ------, not far from Glastonbury It was\u015ait still is\u015asix acres of pasture coiled through by a small streamlet, the \"Little Yeo\", and a fringe of forest that was once home to some of the best quail-hunting in the kingdom. This wood now is untouched, and I am imagining that the quail are multiplying\u015ain their way\u015alike vermin. I am writing now at a desk in the parlor of eldest daughter\u013as home in London, as far as possible to put the now-hated scene from my mind. The consequence of my removal is, however, that, as I am invaded by noise-some carriages and streetcallers even in this small street in Bloomsbury, the malignant fate that has attacked my family\u013as once tranquil fields seems all the more perverse.\nThe time seemed all the more blessed because my eldest daughter, the Duchess of Leek, was staying with us in her period of expectancy. She had chosen to return to her childhood home in order to have at close hand the care and companionship of her family. The Duke had easily allowed it because he had no sisters or living mother, and knew he could not attend much himself to the Duchess, being frequently engaged in important business in the capital. He is a liberal man, and we were all deeply grateful to him. Apart from Deana I was surrounded by my young daughter Margaret, and my son, Rodney, who was on break from Cambridge. This son had surprised me in May by requesting, not funds to tromp sweatily around the continent in the hottest months of the year with his friends, but simply to be allowed home to \"rest his fevered brain.\" Rodney tended too much towards the languorous to be described as, in any fashion, \"fevered\"; and though the phrase smacked of an irritating new faddishness about Wordsworth, I did not challenge because it suited my economy.\nIf Rodney that summer occasionally aroused a father\u013as fear that his son might become absurd\u015aleaving around books of recovered Scotch ballads, speaking frequently about \"the sublime prospect\" looking out from the terrarium, and occasionally strumming something that looked like a mandolin--his younger sister Margaret promised to restore my parental pride through the rationality she had begun to express in her speech and conduct. I was a believer in providing a serious education to all young women who expressed an interest, and because Margaret had inherited my own fascination with natural science, I avidly tutored her. When I was free of the gout that frequently strikes my lower limbs, she would take me on summer walks in the canopied wooded paths. There we would follow the change of the seasons from the first melting snowdrops of March, through the appearance of sheety ice on the river in November. As an education for her, we were developing the first, comprehensive natural history for the region: I was writing captions on the flora and fauna we collected through the summers, which she was simultaneously illustrating the most refined of ink drawings, filled by the most delicate of watercolor shadings. Though, because I was growing more and more indisposed, she had set up a little corner of the greenhouse for a terrarium\u015aa little zoological exhibit--filled with plants and creatures to study.\nThe Duchess, meanwhile, had always been a more feminine personage. Plump and fair-skinned, she had been a prime debutante, and was now, in her element, a warm hostess who could talk easily about the new fashions and other light affairs. But during that late-spring she faltered embarrassingly in the unparalleled high temperatures which struck our part of the country that June, and would with good-humor express her choice to remain inside and eat bon-bons and read novels. She consumed romances like candy, so much so that, in respect of her condition, Moodies\u013a travelling library made a special trip round to our manor to supply her appetite. As her term progressed she became a docile patient and a lax conversationalist, and as she swelled particularly towards her early September due-date (no need for us to be chary about the facts of nature) I thought she seemed an emblem of passive creativity, her personality entirely consumed by the developments which were occurring inside her.\nEven Rodney, who seemed generally mortified about matters of sex, came out to comment on the appearance given by his sister: \"She brings to mind Gaia before she rendered up the Titans,\" he said, referring to the Greek myth of Earth\u013as first, prolific childbirth.\nThe Duchess was so in the background that I could sometimes entertain a colleague in the garden or my ground-floor library, with no fear of a their crossing my daughter\u013as path. A close friend, Aldous Drofield, who was a scientific historian and important exponent of Darwin, was resting out of London at his cousin Lady Brougham\u013as house near Frome, and would drop in of an afternoon.\n\"The Lady Brougham is a delightful hostess,\" he said, after a two-week absence in which they had been occupied with a visiting Countess \"but I come to feel I must have some masculine companionship or I will languish from triviality.\"\n\"Not all women are like the Lady Brougham,\" I corrected; and asked whether he would permit my student Margaret, who I could see peeping from behind the door in curiosity, might attend as Aldous related new proofs of the theory that had been brought in to the Royal Society. Admitted, she made a prim curtsey and seated herself in quiet awe at the eminent philosopher with long whiskers and a protuberant nose, whose writings I had made her read.\n\"No longer are all of the examples of selective adaptation being found in far-flung locations like the West Indies and the Galapogos Islands,\" Aldous told us, in the slow tones of a man in the presence of grave developments, \"they are even now being found in England.\"\n\"For instance, Robertson and Gluett have shown something about toadstools. The same species has been found to have instances in the soggy moors of Yorkshire that need to drink in four and a half cups of water a month to thrive, and other instances in the drier Wolds that need only two cups. They won\u013at be transplanted.\"\nThe theory of natural selection was one of my particular passions as an amateur scientist. Never did I find it the slightest bit demeaning or disturbing\u015arather, I was an advocate of the elegant scheme. When Darwin needed to be assured by his friends that his discovery of man\u013as descendence from the animals wasn\u013at a low thing, but was rather a sign of the surpassing intelligence of nature\u013as design, I was among the rallyers. The image of blind consciousness perfecting itself as it groped up the ladder of the created world\u015afrom the miniscule protozoa, to the creatures that burrowed and crawled and flew, to our own dignified species, that could wonder at itself and deduce the whole scheme by which it had come to pass\u015ait was magnificent, it was positively Platonic. Those cartoons in Punch that mocked Darwin\u013as theories by suggesting an especial cousinship between him and the monkeys in the zoo merely made me raise my eyebrows at the sight of such unredeemable ignorance.\nPerhaps as valuable to me was the way the discovery of interconnectedness gave rational meaning to the investigations of natural scientists like myself, equivalent to that which inhered in the non-organic sciences. No longer were we mere cataloguers: it elevated us to deducers of great patterns and unities. I could examine at the lightness of a bird\u013as frame and muse whether perhaps some of that delicacy was retained in the composition of the human\u013as inner ear, upon which our balance depended. The markings on the tortoise\u013as shell could be translated to the fine ridges on my own fingernails.\nAfter Aldous brought me up on the latest developments, he turned his great spectacle upon Margaret and flattered her by addressing her as a serious scientist.\n\"So I hear you are a student of natural history,\" he said. \"What is your area of field work?\"\n\"I have a terrarium with seven species of beetles, and two tree toads separate in their own cages,\" she said pertly. \"I also have quail\u013as nest of eggs I\u013am waiting to hatch,\" she hesitated, \"I saw its mother kilt by a fox.\"\n\"She was unsure of whether to bring it out of the wood,\" I explained, \"I assured her the eggs would be eaten if she didn\u013at.\"\n\"I keep them under a mound of feathers in the sun, and at night I bring them in before the fire.\"\nAldous smiled at Margaret\u013as earnestness, \"I\u013am sure you provide the chicks\u013a best chance.\"\n\"May I go check on them, please?\" she asked me, suddenly concerned about her brood.\n\"Do run along, Margaret\" I said, \"Aldous and I have some Society business to discuss.\" She whipped out like a duck in sudden flight.\n\"So Aldous,\" I turned to my friend, \"I understand that since we have been permitting ladies to attend our open forums, our rooms can only barely accommodating the crowds\u016f\"\nAldous broke in on me. \"What is that odd music?\" he asked. A passage of discordant, archaic chords seemed to rise up from beyond the garden.\n\"Oh, it is Rodney with his lute,\" I said. \"Medievalism is all the rage at Cambridge this year.\" I passed him a look of contempt for the new generation of Cantabridgians who cared so slightly about the rational freedoms for which our generation had struggled.\nOnce he knew what it was, Aldous became indifferent to Rodney\u013as minstrelsy. I, however, could not. The sum total of Rodney\u013as sickly air and retrogressive habits\u015awandering the fields without purpose, referring as though in deep malaise, at suppertime, to the \"modern era\"\u015awas to irritate me quite beyond myself.\n\"Son,\" I opened the next day at breakfast, \"I beg you to think a little about what you affect to criticize and refuse. You consume all of the advantages of progress. You fly home from Cambridge in five hours on a steam-train, instead of riding a full day and night crammed into a bouncing cart, as I did at your age. Each day you choose from among ten good cotton shirts that have been cheaply and smartly produced in a factory in Manchester, instead of wearing two until they fell to shreds, as students did in my day. You eat my sugar and drink my coffee, which have been harvested across the sea and brought over in iron barges, and then you moan about the devastation wreaked by progress on the modern sensibility.\"\nRodney rose up into himself, \"I would give up sugar and shirts in an instant to feel one half of my share of the spirit I know has been lost in securing their efficiency. But it wouldn\u013at help a mite: the loss afflicts the collective, not the individual.\"\nMy voice rose, \"Why not do what you can! It wouldn\u013at hurt my larder.\" We were at a check-mate. Rodney exited the morning-room, hurt in the moment as a young man will be who reckons his soul is not understood.\nRodney\u013as soul relatively elastic, however, and two hours later he greeted me easily at lunch, and we conversed about the edition of Duns Scotus he had discovered in the library. I noticed he ate a fine helping of navy beans in West-Indian molasses.\nThe heat of that afternoon, I recall, became dreadful. Lightsome Margaret, who generally had to be reminded by Nurse Betty to wear her bonnet when she went out at midday, looked dampened and stringy as the rooms of the house and the atmosphere outside, deprived of breezes, equaled each other in sweltering closeness. Even the Duchess waddled into our company, seeking relief from the doubtlessly more oppressive circumstances upstairs.\n\"Rodney, would you please leave off twanging your strings individually,\" I said. \"We are all irritable. In fact, if you could please obtain Deana and me some cold water.\" We were having the foot-boy run hourly to the well to bring in fresh potation.\nIn truth, I was beginning to feel slightly worried about my expectant daughter suffering through these conditions. I rang for the head butler. \"Louis, please send a note for Dr. Bridges to come as soon as possible. I should like Deana to be checked over. This air is merciless.\"\n\"I\u013am so hot,\" complained Margaret, for the seventeenth time. She was uncharacteristically resisting a book on algae I had assigned her.\n\"Margaret, if you haven\u013at noticed, we are all hot. Why don\u013at you go and check your quail\u013as nest again.\" My son and daughters were hardly children any more, but there were still times when I desperately missed my Anne\u013as easy management of them\nMargaret slumped across the parquet floor and out of the door, walking a wide, aware circle around the leg Rodney had extended to trip his sister. I turned a blind eye to my children\u013as uncivility; I was involved in rereading a book by Haekel.\nIn a few minutes, Margaret returned. I noticed she had a queer look on her face, as she stood just within the doorway to the room.\n\"Margaret,\" I asked. \"Are you feeling ill?\"\n\"I\u013am fine, father,\" she said. \"Rodney, I want to show you something in the terrarium. Please come with me\" He passed out of the room with her, emitting a groan of boredom.\nI became re-immersed in my reading, which was considering progress in the medical sciences from the perspectives of epidemiology and immunology. In just a few more minutes, however, I heard some talking outside the door. \"They must have gotten switched, Margaret, there\u013as nothing in it\u016f\"\n\"There is, Rodney, we must show him.\"\n\"Show me what?\" I bellowed.\n\"Papa\u016f\" said Margaret, who seemed as if she would cry, \"there\u013as something wrong with the chicks.\"\n\"What?\" It was my turn to be impatient with having to shuttle around on my gouty legs in that humidity.\n\"You must come see.\"\nSo I rose up and tottered to the west wing of the house, where we kept the greenhouse full of exotic plants, and Margaret\u013as small zoology museum. The glass walls, though shaded over by the rubber trees and jungle ferns that were growing great gangbusters, seemed to concentrate the sun like hellfire.\n\"Here,\" she pointed.\nI looked where she pointed, at the compact little fibrous nest she had found in the low branch of a sycamore. Where the four, billiard-sized speckled eggs had been were half-shells cradling four tiny, reptilian creatures. They had hints of scales, and their bodies were narrowed and culminated in thickened legs. Their winglets were degraded into tiny, superfluous stumps. Despite myself, I drew back in visceral horror.\n\"How did those lizards get in the quail\u013as nest?\" I asked. \"Margaret, did you mix up your terrarium exhibits?\"\n\"No. You know I never mix things up,\" she insisted.\n\"Don\u013at some birds adopt other eggs?\" volunteered Rodney.\n\"Cuckoo\u013as leave their own eggs to hatch in other birds\u013a nests. But that wouldn\u013at explain how lizards eggs got in to Margaret\u013as quail\u013as nest.\"\n\"Well, there must have been a confusion somewhere along the line,\" said Rodney, \"Or else you will genuinely have something to report to the Royal Society.\"\nLouis stopped at the door of the greenhouse. \"Sir,\" I said, \"Doctor Bridges is here for Duchess Deana.\"\n\"I must go,\" I said. \"Margaret, if you could dispose of your toads and put these in a cage, that might be the best recourse. It is rare to find lizards in England under any circumstances, and we shall be lucky to have the opportunity to study them, when the heat breaks. Meanwhile, no one must mention the new exhibit to Deana. It could upset her, in her condition.\"\nWithin a few hours the subject died down. This was a proceed I encouraged, since all of my concern was in fact focussed on Deana. The Doctor said that she was fundamentally healthy, though all efforts should be made to keep her cool and her blood pressure from rising. We set her up on a chaise in the parlour so she would not have to go up and down stairs, and brought in two daughters of one of our tenant farmers to fan her.\n\"Father, there needn\u013at be such a fuss made about me!\" complained Deana, \"dozens of women give birth every day in England.\" But of course her arguments held no water with me. This woman was my daughter, as well as the Duchess of a very important family, and the repository of its heir as well as my own. Despite herself, she was comforted by the fanning, and even by the presence of the hale little girls--perhaps anticipating having her own daughters soon to care for. Because Deana was at an early age thrown into the position of having to be a surrogate mother to young Margaret, she featured an enthusiastic maternal sense, and was never to be found far from children.\nMeanwhile, I saw that Margaret was nurturing her own small wards with like avidity, learning to care for her changeling lizards by bringing them flies and giving them a little pool of fresh water daily. Her early disappointment at not having little quail-chicks was soon appeased in her discoveries. She was forbidden to talk about them in front of Deana, of course, but in the corridors she would whisper to me importantly, \"Father, they are grown two inches.\"\nMy pre-occupation was making Margaret independent of my tutelage in the biological world--so much so that she also went on to make her own fresh discovery. One day, after she had gone out with her bucket to fetch water from the small recession where a minor tributary of the \"Little Yeo\" pooled, she returned with glee to say, \"The pond is full of pollywogs!\"\nShe asked if she could bring me down to help examine some, but I told her not, I was simply too involved with matters around the house.\n\"Perhaps you can take Rodney.\" I suggested.\n\"But it bores him so dreadfully,\" she said, \"he\u013as no fun about biology.\"\n\"Well, give him a try,\" I insisted, thinking that while I was so busy, I would request him to spend some time with his sister each day, bringing her up on some of the subjects that were at his own disposal. A smattering of Latin contributed greatly to remembering the names of species. Accordingly, I was not displeased when I began to daily spy the two of them through the window, going down to the pond together, Margaret with her bucket in tow, and Rodney with some sort of book, out of which he appeared to be reciting.\nI was not during that period immensely available to Margaret, but once again she whispered to me before I entered the dining hall, \"Rodney says there\u013as something odd about the pond.\"\n\"What\u013as that,\" I said.\n\"The pollywogs never became frogs, as he says they always did when he was my age. Instead they became fish.\"\n\"Well, they were minnows, then.\"\n\"I guess so\" she agreed.\nInterested in the possibility of our little depression becoming stocked with fish, I asked her if she and Rodney could try to trap some minnows and identify them.\n\"Oh, we have,\" she said, \"But they don\u013at look like any we can find in the England Freshwater guidebook,\"\n\"Why, what do they look like?\"\n\"They are strange. They have both their eyes on one side, and they stick one above the water when they swim.\"\n\"What! You must be mistaken.\"\n\"I am not,\" Margaret became petulant. \"Ask Rodney then. He noticed it.\"\n\"Perhaps he is teasing you,\" I said.\n\"It\u013as plain to see. We have some in the terrarium for you to look at,\" she concluded, as we hustled into dinner in order to not be a cause for Deana\u013as curiosity.\nThat night I did not sleep well, stirred by nightmares of lines species intersecting and exchanging attributes. In my dreams, birds had husky feet like gryphons, fish sprouted wings and flew, and insects present faces like rodents. A goat walked up on two legs, and a rat suddenly hatched fins and swam down to the bottom of the ocean. My own catalogues of fauna, as I pored over them to place these anomalies, became twisted and disorderly before my very eyes, as branches and classes surged upwards and downwards and got hopelessly entangled with each other.\nIn the morning, after purging these ridiculous images from my head with a strong coffee, I went in to the greenhouse with Rodney and Margaret, and my Farnham\u013as Ichthyology\u015athe world\u013as most complete illustrated guide to fish classification. If my own property was determined to occasion discoveries rare in England, I would rise to them with a scientist\u013as perfect equanimity and objectivity.\n\"I understand our frogpond has seen a development,\" I addressed my son.\n\"Yes\u015athere aren\u013at any frogs! Just these beastly fish racing madly around the pond\" he said, and pointed me to the scene he and his sister had approximated in a washing-tub. I could clearly see several four-inch, extremely elongated minnows zipping to and fro beneath the surface of the water, with one eye propped above it, evidently to help it catch insects.\n\"If you\u013ad kindly lend me your small net,\" I asked my daughter, who was gripping one in a white-fisted manner.\n\"Unmistakeable,\" I said of the small creature I plucked out, \"it seems to be a member of the classification Anableps, otherwise known as the four-eyed fish. They are typically found in the rivers of eastern South America.\n\"Well, what the devil are they doing in our frog pond,\" my son challenged.\n\"I cannot say.\" I said. \"Perhaps there has been a contamination. Alternatively, the biological world is constantly modifying and adapting, and perhaps we\u013are seeing the signs of natural selection in our own midst, producing some new, more favorable classification.\"\nIn myself, I tried to suspend all speculation, and hoped that a more qualified scientist could assess the situation more conclusively. I sent a note to Aldous that requested him to pass by as soon as he could.\n\"I never mind the occasion to visit you, Kingsley,\" he said, after pulling up in Lady Brougham\u013as hansom, \"but this seemed almost an urgent request.\"\n\"Not urgent, Aldous; we merely need your expertise to consider a local curiosity that has come up. We have a sample of it in the greenhouse, where I will ask you to come. But first, can I offer you some refreshment? An iced tea?\" The heat had died off somewhat over the previous few nights, but the roads were dusty.\n\"I\u013am fine, thank you. Please lead me straight to this curiosity, as you call it.\"\nWe went into the greenhouse, where Margaret and Rodney were prodding their various specimens with straws.\n\"Rodney, I didn\u013at know you had a hankering after biology,\" Aldous said bluffly.\n\"Only its grotesques,\" Rodney answered, flashing what I considered a rude grin.\n\"I beg pardon\u016f\"\n\"Look at these here,\" I diverted Aldous, not wanting his observations to be prejudiced by our family\u013as conversations, \"They came from our pooling of the \"Little Yeo\"--hardly even a puddle.\"\n\"Anableps Anableps,\" he said immediately. \"Perhaps one of your neighbours brought back an aquarium from Peru?\"\n\"I\u013am sure the Reynolds or the Merriweathers haven\u013at sent anyone to Peru, this year,\" I concluded. \"Is there no possibility it could be a native development?\n\"A mutation?\" he answered. \"But then it would occur singly, first. And step by step, not at all drastically. It would have to grow out of a local species. What other fish have you had in the pond?\"\n\"Actually, none,\" I said, with some embarrassment.\n\"Well then there\u013as no chance at all,\" he said, \"unless it\ndeveloped out of a river species. What fish are there in the \"Little Yeo?\"\n\"Only a few small grayling and trout,\" I said.\n\"Not even a halibut, of course\" he contributed, \"they never come this far inland.\"\nRodney contributed offhandedly, \"Unless it\u013as going backward.\"\n\"Going backward, what?\" I said, annoyed at his manner to my guest.\n\"You know, evolution. Isn\u013at this how it might be, then? Frogs turning out weird slithery fish that have to look around above the water, birds hatching lizard-things. Evolution turned right back around, taking us back down into amoebas.\"\nAldous sniggered at him, \"Young man, you evidently have no familiarity with the concept of evolution. It is an account of progression--of the tendency of all things towards higher specie, towards perfection.\"\n\"Well, maybe it\u013as turned round, then. I wouldn\u013at care.\"\n\"How ridiculous.\" Aldous turned to me, \"What does your son mean by \u0139lizard-things?\u013a\"\n\"Oh that was merely another mishap,\" I said neatly, considering it might be best to retreat from the subject with the children present. Rodney was indeed confirming himself as an imbecile.\nBut then Margaret piped up. \"My quail\u013as nest hatched lizards. Only, they\u013are not really complete lizards,\" she hesitated, \"they\u013are sort of midway from birds. They have little wings that don\u013at work, and they still have beaks, but they\u013are scaly, and crawl on long thick legs.\"\nThis reported maturation was something I had heard nothing about, in my absence from the terrarium.\n\"My word!\" said Aldous, \"Let me see.\"\nWe peered into Margaret\u013as cage, and saw exactly what she had described. The little amorphous creatures had developed to be almost like little griffins: small birds with distinctly animal bodies that crawled and would never fly.\n\"No one told me this had occurred,\" I ejected.\n\"We didn\u013at want to alarm you,\" Margaret said, \"You were already tied up about Deana.\"\nAldous boomed in, \"Kingsley, I think we have here issue to be seriously discussed, certainly outside of the nursery. It may indeed be a matter for the police--someone may be playing a practical joke on you. For now, however, I must return to Lady Brougham\u013as for supper. I assure you I shall be turning over the whole business in my mind.\" The old man, showing his eminence in the solid way in which he enunciated his words and decisively made out for his hansom, bolstered us all. He took the matter on himself\u015aor perhaps he only sloughed it off entirely\u015ain any event he left us for a few days feeling more secure and disburdened.\nIn the calm wake of his departure, my children and I grew to be more of a connected community than ever before. Rodney reformed his attitude, and became conversational with me, as well as chivalrous with Margaret--as though troubling to shield her from the burden of taking the results of her experiments upon herself. We all, meanwhile flocked more concentratedly around Deana, who was, now that cool breezes flushed every corner of the house, a fund of calm self-satisfaction, and an emblem of normal and desirable processes.\nBut meanwhile I was aware that this unity within the family household, was founded on a suppressed well of primordial anxiety. We were linked together under siege by a natural world that was, in luxuriant midsummer, flourishing malevolently up to our very doorstop. Every day Rodney and Margaret would venture out into the woods in a grim mood that yoked their fascination to their horror. And every day they would return with more repulsive specimens that suggested this local tendency of nature to deliver up lower and more brutish formations.\nOne afternoon Margaret observed that the butterfly exiting a longstanding dormant pupa in the crevice of a birch tree was dull and beetle-like, its small dark wings holding it in the air for only a second before it found a preferred habitat under piles of vegetation on the forest floor. On another morning Rodney spotted, in the groove of a soft decaying log, a well of slime to which the local ants were bringing their morsels of food. It was as though they were preparing an exchange of their teeming, socially complex city with a more torpid civilization that would reproduce the primal bog from which they had sprung. Rodney and Margaret\u013as zoological exhibit in the terrarium grew as the two of them took care to reproduce these environments as accurately as they could, and to make notes and sketches to endow to what I was beginning to worry might be an equally somnolent posterity.\nAt the same time, Aldous Drofield\u013as scoundrel brother-in-law perished from a rotted liver, and my friend was called back to London to help sort out contention surrounding the will. I continued to send him extensive updates on our ecological developments, which he responded to briefly, with earnest concern, but without willingness to theorize. The evidence was too assorted from which to draw general conclusions, he found. What we had before us were anomalies which between them did not justify a trend. As a scientist, I accepted his methodological objectivity; though sometimes I wished he would, as my friend, suspend it for an instant. I craved an interpretation\u015aa philosophy--that would help endow my situation with a sense of coherence, and Aldous\u013as austere notes left me unconsoled.\nFinally, however, the household became distracted from our scientific inquiries as my dear Deana\u013as pregnancy more significantly approached its own crisis. With her first sign of strain, Dr. Bridges was brought in, and thereupon began to assume constant vigil at her side. Betty the head maid provided the woman\u013as attendance on Deana; all the more comforting, we could be assured, for having presided at Deana\u013as own birth and through my offspring\u013as childhood. I myself found Betty somewhat of a stony presence, but the children all pledged to love her. Apart from her husband, the Duke, whom we were assured was travelling up on the first train possible, Deana wanted nothing else for her sense of stability.\nIn the evening, as the imminent hour settled over the house, lifting us all up in the tremulous anticipation, the Duke miraculously arrived, and I think cheered us all with his handsome appearance and demeanor of loving care. Dr. Bridges allowed the husband only to put his head into the doorway and greet his wife, before insisting he be taken off and fed with supper and whiskey. I myself, who had been pacing all day as nervously as any husband, was happy to join him at his table, though I had already dined. Rodney and Margaret made off to sleep.\n\"So all is well in chambers?\" I volunteered.\n\"It\u013as a most auspicious moment,\" the young Duke offered between forkfuls, \"every quarter is positively brimming with development.\nWe carried on, with the Duke elaborating serious as well as frivolous matters of state in order to distract both of us from the events upstairs, of which we heard some sounds. The Duke was bearing up to first fatherhood with as much composure as could be expected of him, but none of our gossip about coming cabinet reshuffles could match, for excitement and suspense, the background of the singular human drama that was taking place in our very own house.\nEventually, I could see the suspense becoming too much for him. In the interests of his fortitude, since my experience warned me that there was always a threat of alarm and mishap in the case of childbirth, I urged him to drink down the last of his whiskey. But when he had emptied his glass I escorted him willingly and with nearly equal anticipation up the wide carpeted staircase.\nWe were barred, however, at the door at the door of the bedroom by Betty, the large, brusque head housemaid who kept flawless books but revealed nothing in her impermeable expressions.\n\"Has it... occurred?\" said the Duke, unsure of how to speak of his situation to this impressive person.\n\"It has,\" she said, with stolid impassivity.\n\"Are the mother and child healthy? Is it a Boy or girl?\" I ejected, annoyed that she did anticipate a husband and a father\u013as most obvious questions.\n\"Everybody\u013as bouncy. See for yourself.\" She opened the door an impossibly slender crack, at sight of which we ourselves pushed past her and flung it open.\nWe entered the room and saw Deana lit by candlelight, and were assured that she was beautiful, calm and sleeping. The room showed no sign of the energetic disturbance which had surely a few minutes back shook it from floor to ceiling; it was a landscape of repose and necessary industry. A nurse was restoring the linens and cleaning up the doctor\u013as equipment, and Doctor Bridges, the much-trusted custodian of the newborn, was bent over a washing table that had been prepared for the special purpose.\n\"I should like to see my child\" the Duke demanded, with the mixture of pride and nervousness that is the hallmark of the new father. His flushed face showed the kind of openness that indicated his spontaneous willingness to embrace the new life, to cultivate and nurture this small stranger, whoever and whatever it was, and make it his own.\nBut when Dr. Bridges turned to us, he presented a face drawn with unease. He leaned towards the basin and paused a moment, his shoulders appearing from the back to emit a heavy shrug. He then turned, towards us, smoothly lifting and cradling the tiny infant.\nThe Duke\u013as slightly outspread arms dropped. \"But it has so much\u016fhair,\" he gasped.\nOf course, when we look back on the fateful birth of this child, it only perfectly fit the course of all of the other biological developments we had observed. I had long accepted that humans are no more than evolved beasts; and Rodney\u013as words, it appeared in retrospect, had been bound to prove prophetic on every level. Evolution was demonstrating its insistence to turn backwards throughout the domain of my ancestral home, including my own family.\nThen and now I could not guess why my household was chosen to be its pivot point, though at times I feel susceptible to an old dark religion of merciless gods, who punish hubris with tragic fates. Those dark forces, if they are ironical, would have something to laugh at in me, their victim, sent back from the vistas of modern scientific optimism to be the receptacle of gloomy apocalyptic visions.\nWe have a hope that with my daughter\u013as birth, the trials of my family, insofar we as are absolutely bound to experience them, will have achieved their apex. We have made a pact to give this trend no further opportunity. We will bear no further offspring and keep no pets, and live entirely in the city. We have sold off our tenant farms outright and left our estate to grow fallow, and our home to become windswept. I have nothing to do with my borough, and have sold off my seat in the House of Lords, which my family held from the time of Cromwell. If nature is yet composing new freakish forms on my property, I refuse to know anything of it, and forbid my children scientific excavations. The line, we have all agreed, will be actively drawn here, notwithstanding the scientific caution of Mr. Drofield. We do not have Mr. Drofield\u013as luxury of waiting and seeing.\nI am, meanwhile, coming to believe my family\u013as personal stand is taken in vain. I have heard strange rumors issuing from the backdoor of the Royal Society, of similar anomalies occurring in other parts of the country. Though, the convinced evolutionists have not undertaken to present these events to serious scrutiny. Perhaps their minds are so fashioned as not to accept the evidence. Or perhaps they know that the moral upset resulting from any honest scientific assessment of these happenings would be too great for this country, whose watchword is Progress, to withstand. If so, I agree with them: better these events be left for the avatars of superstition to pawn off as random curses and bedevilments, than that the citizens of England be challenged in our longstanding faiths in all forms of perfectibility, moral and spiritual included.\nAmong ourselves we try, despite these ominous indications, not to let the flames of our moral sensibility flutter. Out of natural human feeling, the Duke and Duchess are raising their son, whom they named \"Alistair\", after no one. They love him as the only object of affection they will ever rear.\nIn the interests of public tranquillity and private safety, though, they maintain him secretly in the house and in a walled-off garden. He is now three years old and appears to have about half the capacity of a normal boy. He can pile blocks and smile at each of us distinctly, though sometimes he emits shrieks that pierce our very souls.\nAt such moments, passing neighbors will give our house a strange look. Once a delivery man who overheard the cacophony asked what sort of zoo we keep within. At this query we forced a smile and shut the door upon him: the answer being, we keep no more deliberate zoos; we only keep ourselves.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20051031124944\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/julysept2000\/zoological_exhibit.htm","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"Suzy is a doctoral student in Victorian Literature in Halifax, Novia Scotia.

Little One\u2019s breath smelled wrong. The wrong smell clung to his body.\nHer ears told her. Sounds rattled in him. Bad sounds. She put her ear up to Little One\u2019s chest. Bad Thing snickered at her from inside Little One. Bad Thing wanted Little One. It didn\u2019t want him like Leopard or Lion. But Bad Thing wanted Little One.\nHer fingers told her. She ran them through the short black hair on Little One\u2019s back. Little One\u2019s hair was too dry. She touched his forehead. Little One was too warm.\nEven her eyes told her. Little One\u2019s face was too pale. His face was hung limp. His nose oozed yellow-green. She pried open one eye and peered in, looking for Little One. Little One was far away.\nThis was wrong. This was very bad. She was scared.\nDaybreak shot through the trunks of the grove, playing across the rest of the Band. A similar sight might remind one of her descendants of the morning sun dancing between the columns inside a cathedral. The Band stirred nervously. Butterflies and dust motes flitted in and out the beams of sunlight. She squinted back at them and into the low sun. She remembered Little One chasing them, falling, and laughing. She smiled at the memory. She looked down at him, floppy in her arms. Little One did not move. She turned his little head toward the butterflies so he could see. Little One did not care.\nShe glanced up at the canopy of leaves, swaying gently in the kind morning breeze. She could not help appraising the tiny reddening balls among the branches. The fruit would seem dwarfed and bitter compared to its descendants. But she would never conceive of such things. She only knew that soon this fruit would be ready to eat.\nThis grove of trees was friendly. That was why she had brought the Band here. The grove always gave cool shade from the sun. The grove often gave safety from Leopard. The grove sometimes gave food to the Band. Except for the hot-dry days still far away, the little brook at her feet was filled with cool, clear water. The Band felt good here. The Band felt safe. They claimed this place as home. Not that they had given this grove any kind of name like \u201chome\u201d. She didn\u2019t even call the tiny male she held clutched to her chest \u201cLittle One\u201d. This was not quite yet the age of names. But there was still a sense of \u201chome\u201d in the hearts of the Band, there was still a sense of \u201cLittle One\u201d in her heart, and there was still a sense of \u201cBad Thing\u201d in Little One.\nShe squatted on her heels. She clutched Little One. She rocked back and forth. She squinted at the sky to her left, the direction that would come to be named east. The sun crept up. It no longer touched the edge of the world. It climbed half way to the top of the sky as she comforted Little One. She waited. She could feel Bad Thing in him. She wanted to tear and scratch Bad Thing. She could do nothing. She rocked Little One in her arms.\nShe remembered the night that had just passed. She always held him close during the night. His tiny scrap of warmth would snuggle against her. That was always good. Except last night. Last night Little One was too warm. He fussed and whined. Before long he was as hot as a black stone in the sun. He thrashed back and forth. He made small sounds of pain. His little eyes sought out hers, asking for help. She tried. She could not help Little One then. She could not help him now. Her throat hurt.\nAs she lingered, the sun climbed to the top of the sky. It pounded down on the grass just beyond the trees, the lush grass as yet mown only by the grazing herds whose sinews would someday make excellent bowstrings.\nSomething was there. Her head jerked up. The Band noticed her quick movement and tensed. It was close. Her eyes darted. She could not see It, but she could feel It. It was there, in the grass just beyond the trees, on the other side of the brook. It was not like Bad Thing that wanted Little One. But It was there and It was something\u2026 different. She had learned to fear different. The hair on her back jumped up in a ridge. Clutching Little One, she turned, about to dash back to the safety of the Band. Over her shoulder she watched the grass. It stirred. She crouched. She knew she should scamper away, but she did not.\nSuddenly, the grass whipped back and forth. Danger! It charged at her, at Little One. She could not see It. Angry with herself for waiting, she vaulted sideways. She landed awkwardly and fell. Still clutching Little One, she sprang to her feet. She tried to flee toward the Band. It moved too swiftly. It swept over them. She cringed. She pulled Little One closer. It swept all around her. Her eyes darted, trying to see. Her free hand struck out. She growled in fear. Her usually reliable nostrils flared wildly. She caught a whiff. Of what?\nIt seemed to grab her. She pulled back. It wrapped around her. She struggled. She couldn\u2019t move. She tensed, and covered Little One. She waited helplessly for Its fangs to sink into her!\nBut It did not bite. It did not hurt her. It soothed. She looked down at Little One. He too seemed more comfortable. Her nose twitched. What was It? Wind? That was all she could compare It to. But she knew that was not right. The Wind Thing seemed to whisper to her, like the Breeze might. The Breeze was her friend. The Breeze could tell her where water was falling from the sky. The Breeze could tell her Leopard was hunting the Band. She sniffed. What did the Wind Thing tell her?She paused, sniffed again. What? She could not understand. Not yet. She tried and tried as the sun crept across the top of the sky. She gave up. Little One needed her.\nHe was still as hot as the dark stones. His breath rasped shallowly in and out. She scooped a little water out of the brook with her hand. She poured it into his parched open mouth. The water rolled out the corner of Little One\u2019s mouth, trickled through the fur on his cheek and fell, disappearing between her toes into the clay that would someday make passable pottery.\nShe remembered when Bad Thing had tried to take others in the Band. They got hot. Some got a little hot. Others got very hot. Most shivered. Many smelled like Little One did now. She could not remember the smell ever being so strong. Except once.\nSister came over to offer comfort. Seeing Sister made her remember the same strong smell on Brother. That was a very sad time. It was the saddest time of her life. Until now. She shook her head. She would not remember that. She would remember good things.\nShe remembered that many times Bad Thing lost his grip. Others cooled down again. Soon they ran and jumped. They were just like before. That happened to her long before. That would happen to Little One now. She knew it would.\nBut bad memories crept back. Sometimes others stopped moving. Brother was as hot as Little One was now. Brother stopped moving. He never moved again. The search for food and water pulled the Band away. They left Brother behind. When they returned, Brother was gone. There was no sign of him. No one ever saw Brother again. The Band forgot Brother. But she did not forget.\nThat would not happen to Little One! She would not let it happen! She clutched him between her knees. She wrapped both arms around him. Little One always liked to move closer. He did not move closer. He just grunted weakly in pain. She needed to make Little One feel good. She picked through his hair with her one free hand, looking for Tiny Tasties. That always made Little One feel good. Little One did not notice. This was wrong. This was very wrong.\nThe sun was now at what would someday be called three o\u2019clock. It continued to pound relentlessly on the grove and the grass surrounding it. A faint buzz slipped up on her from nowhere. It sounded like one of the tiny tasty Flying Things. It danced in and out of her ears. Sometimes it even seemed to be in her head. She waved. Flying Thing would not go away.\nThen the sound of Flying Thing changed, higher, then lower in pitch. It reminded her of the strange Wind Thing she had felt before, but she did not know how. She twitched her ears. She sniffed the air again. What did Flying Thing say? It did not speak of water or love or food or home or the Band or Little One. It did not say any of those things. Yet Flying Thing seemed to say all those things. It was whispering something more. It was whispering something different.\nHer head throbbed. She could not understand. She hurt too much. Something was wrong with Little One. She stopped trying to understand the buzzing. She turned back to Little One.\nShe would not let Little One stop moving. She would never leave Little One behind. She would never come back and find Little One gone forever.\nShe touched Little One\u2019s face. Too hot! Too hot! She clutched Little One to her breast. She pulled a Tiny Tasty out of his hair. She put it in his mouth. The Tiny Tasty lay on Little One\u2019s tongue. Little One would not try to eat it. His dark eyes, his precious little dark eyes would not look at her. Little One must cool down. Little one must jump and run and laugh again. She tickled him. His little smile would always make her feel good. Little One would not smile.\nHis chest rose and fell. That was good. But he worked too hard. And wrong sounds still came from him. She did not know what to do.\nShe lifted up Little One\u2019s arm and let it go. It thumped on the clay. She clutched him close again. She rocked on her heels again. Her throat was so tight it hurt. The sun slipped down the other side of the sky.\nShe wailed. The sound rolled across the grassy plains and into some yew trees that could have made stout bows. The Band jumped. They knew what her sound meant. She was angry. She hurt. None of the Band would dare come near her. Her anger, her frustration scared them all. Leopard heard her cry, and thought it better to look elsewhere for his dinner.\nFar off, the sky rumbled, echoing her cry. Her nose told her to look to what would someday be north. The Breeze carried the faint hint of water falling from the sky. She knew she could take the Band that way to find Little Wiggles as they fled the dirt to escape the water from the sky. It was simple. She snorted with pride. She had learned this long before. But the Breeze carried that other message, the one she could not understand, the message of the strange Wind Thing, the message of the strange Flying Thing. What did it say? She sniffed the Breeze once, twice, three times more. It was coming. What was coming?\nBetween her and the water from the sky, the Band waited. They made sounds that told her they wanted to move. Her eyes set as hard as the raw, still unknapped flint scattered in the nearby stream bed. She was big. She was strong. They would not move until Little One was ready to laugh and play. She would not let them. She would bite them. She would pound them with her fists. She would even bully the Big Male to stay. The Band would not move until she told them to move. She was certain of that.\nShe was strong. But she was afraid Bad Thing in Little One\u2019s chest was stronger. His breathing caught roughly and stopped. Her heart clenched into a cold stone ball. She yanked him away from her chest so she could see his face. An ugly itch scurried up her back. This felt like the time Leopard had come between her and Little One. That had happened near the water hole. She could have called the Band. Together, they might have driven it off. But she knew there was no time. She snarled and attacked.\nLeopard turned. He pulled his ears back. He spit at her. He wanted Little One. He kept looking over his shoulder at Little One, wanting to make a dash for him. She would not let him. She growled fiercely and pitched stones at Leopard. He would not leave, but he dared not turn his back on her.\nShe inched sideways. Leopard circled the other way. Soon she worked herself between Little One and Leopard. Leopard howled and whined, frustrated. She thought he would eat her. She thought he would eat Little One. She plucked up a sharp stone and hurled it at Leopard\u2019s head with all her strength. The stone bounced off his head with a satisfying \u201cbonk\u201d. Leopard howled in pain and glared at her fiercely. But she did not flinch. She glared back. Their eyes locked. Then she saw she had already won. Leopard was stunned by her fury. Leopard was scared. He backed off.\nLeopard tried to pretend he was not defeated. But he still did not turn his back to her. He inched backwards, slipping one paw back, then another. Only when he felt safe, did he turn his back on her. His ears came up. The hair on his back went back down. His tail twitched proudly from side to side. He was trying to make her believe he was not hungry. He was trying to make her believe he did not care about Little One. He was pretending he was not afraid of her. He acted like he just decided not to waste another moment on her and Little One.\nShe had shrieked in triumph. She laughed at the tawny cat. Leopard pretended he did not notice, but she saw his ears curl back toward her laughter. Leopard slinked off. His black spots finally disappeared into the scrub. His tail flicked one last nonchalant good-bye and disappeared.\nShe remembered Leopard and smiled. But then she remembered Little One. Her smile faded. She could not drive off the Bad Thing as she had Leopard. This time her throat hurt too much to snarl. She made a pitiful try.\nLittle One\u2019s breath hitched again. She looked into his eyes. Little One\u2019s eyes had rolled back up into his head. His breathing stopped.\nShe shook him. He moved his arms. She was certain he moved his arms. For one last moment his eyes did turn to her. He saw her. He smiled. Then he was gone.\nHe did not breathe again. She shook him. She placed her ear against his chest. She listened. She heard no good noise. She shook him again. She placed her ear to Little One\u2019s chest again. She was desperate to hear anything now. Even Bad Thing was quiet in Little One\u2019s chest. The silence from Little One was the worst thing that ever happened.\nShe bellowed. She howled again and again. The Band scampered away.Each howl scooted them a little deeper into the safety of the grove. Some even fled into the branches.\nThe sun was now near the other end of the world. Little One had not moved for a long time. The Band was nervous. Most were still too afraid to let her see their impatience. Sister finally came over. Sister picked Little One up and propped him up on his feet. She let go. Little One slapped against the red clay. The sick sound made her stomach turn over. Little One did not move. Sister reached for Little One to try again. She shoved her sister away. She gathered Little One up. She clutched him to her chest. She rocked back and forth on her heels. Sister tugged at Little One in her arms. She would not let go. There was pain in her throat. There was a pain in her chest. Tears seeped across her dark skin.\nSister tried to drag Little One from her arms again. She pulled back. Her sister pulled harder. Sister snarled anger. She leapt at Sister. She slapped Sister on an ear. Sister staggered back, stunned. She felt bad. She did not want to hurt Sister. Sister skulked over to the Band in the dark shadows of the trees.\nThe sun now touched the earth. Little One still did not move. She was empty. She ran her hand over his precious little face. She let a finger linger on Little One\u2019s lip. She reached up and pried open his eyelid. Little One\u2019s eyes were empty. She slumped on top of him.\nThe Wind Thing returned. It swirled. It buzzed in her ears. She did not care. It closed in upon her and Little One.\nEve understood Little One was no longer in the tiny body that lay in her arms. She realized he would never be there again. She bowed her head and began to moan.\nThe Band trembled in the grove. They too had felt the strangeness of the wind. Now, they could feel a strangeness from Eve. They had learned to fear different. A different sound came from Eve. They could not understand her. But the meaning would have been clear to any one of Eve\u2019s daughters or sons, even twenty thousand generations later.\nThere, on the plains of what her children would name Africa, Eve stood, both feet planted squarely. She arched her back. Her spine cracked. She stretched both hands out and up to the glittering stars of the warm early evening. She cocked her head toward the heavens, desperate to find someone she could feel but could not see. And Eve howled at the heavens...\n\u201cWHY!?\u201d","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050421124105\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/aprjun2001\/eve.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The Internet's Premier Magazine of Historical Science Fiction","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/NuiZ0X9ABKj2mS3Qx6iQ5+D8tPE.json","volume":2.0,"issues":2.0,"has_text":true}

Schmidt\nCHAPTER\nONE\nThe\nbox lay heavily in her hands, her eyes searching its metallic sheen\nfor a reflection. The burnished oak staircase curled behind her,\nframing her figure with unintended intensity.\n\u201cWe\nhave tried everything we know,\u201d said Leeds, his brow furrowed,\n\u201cBut for the life of us, we cannot duplicate Madame Franchot\u2019s\nimages.\u201d\n\u201cActually,\nLeeds, what we cannot duplicate is the clarity. Images we get in\nabundance.\u201d Murchison\u2019s eyes darkened, then lit up on seeing the\nwoman smile.\n\u201cAre\nyou saying, dear, that you need the woman\u2019s touch in this case?\u201d\nShe held up the box and posed prettily.\n\u201cFeminine\nintuition?\u201d Leeds chuckled.\n\u201cThinner fingers?\"\nAbilene\ntwisted her mouth. \u201cMurchison, you are being your usual insufferable\nself.\u201d He bowed gallantly. \u201cMy husband has greater appreciation\nfor a woman\u2019s wiles than you do.\u201d\nLeeds\nducked involuntarily, a smile curling his lips. \u201cThat is why he has\nbeen so ignominiously trapped,\u201d he heard Murchison riposte.\nAbilene\nshook the box. \u201cYou monster!\u201d she laughed. \u201cYou just wish you\nwere so well-trapped as your partner.\u201d Leeds and Abilene exchanged a\nfond happy nod as Murchison sighed quietly.\n\u201cHow\nlong do you think it will take you to get clear images?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure, dear, I never saw what this Madame Franchot did, and your efforts only showed me that the images move too fast to be made out clearly.\u201d\n\u201cIf we follow her trajectory, it probably took Madame Franchot several months to master this box enough for utility. We worked with it for just a few days.\u201d Murchison rummaged carefully in his jacket for his small pipe.\n\u201cIn any case, Abilene, whatever progress you make with the box needs to be detailed scientifically. Use a new journal and list the times you make the attempt, the steps you take to alter the images and what the results were, the types of images you s--.\u201d Leeds felt a heavy hand on his shoulder.\n\u201cShe knows.\u201d\nLeeds reddened. \u201cAh, yes, that\u2019s true.\u201d He paused in confusion. \u201cYou, ah, know what to do.\u201d\nAbilene laughed sofly. \u201cNot exactly, but I\u2019ll make sure I record my feeble efforts in great detail.:\n\u201cBuy two journals,\u201d erupted from the small cloud of pipe smoke.\n\u201cOh, go away, you beast,\u201d tossed Abilene over her shoulder, taking the staircase to the second floor.\nBoth men watched her disappear, remaining silent even until her steps faded into silence. Leeds pulled a telegram from inside his jacket. \u201cWhat did you make of this message?\u201d\n\u201cThat Little Billy has had his laboratory rebuilt and that his mother is pretending to be sick again. Otherwise, he\u2019d come here and pester us for our instruments.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, but these are interesting words: \u2018Spirits and beasts for your perusal. Begin with me.\u2019 I wonder if he realizes what category he fits in,\u201d mused Leeds.\nMurchison smiled. \u201cOh, he knows. The same category your darling wife so accurately places me in.\u201d\nLeeds flushed a bit, smiling. \u201cShes very fond of you, you know.\u201d\nMurchison nodded, his eyes distant under a furrowed brow. \u201cShe reminds me of my mum.\u201d\nA choked laugh erupted from the smaller man. \u201cDon\u2019t you tell that to Abilene! She\u2019d be furious!\u201d He chuckled quietly, enjoying the moment.\n\u201cMy lips are sealed. Now, are we going to stop in at Little Billy\u2019s laboratory or shall we wait for him to thunder the door off of its hinges?\u201d\nLeeds clapped his hands softly. \u201cTo the laboratory. He may be a good amateur scientist, but patience is definitely not his strong suit.\u201d Leeds turned to a coat rack to retrieve his heavy cape. Putting it on, he said softly \u201cI only hope Abilene can make sense of that box. And soon.\u201d\nMurchison stopped the reaming of his pipe. \u201cWhat do you think might happen?\u201d His level voice was somber.\nLeeds shrugged and looked at Murchison directly. \u201cThe box knows what will happen.\u201d\nCHAPTER TWO\n\u201cThe blasted lab,\u201d said Murchison as the one-horse carriage drew to a stop in front of an expansive, if seedy, mansion.\n\u201cLiterally. Though it seems Little Billy has been hard at work.\u201d The two men stepped down and set their cloaks to the biting wind. Leaves dance around their feet and legs as they crossed a sward of dried grass and brittle thistles.\nThe laboratory was a fairly large barn-like structure with a squarish dome on top. The wooden planks were as yet unpainted, but the door was awash in what could only be described as a vivid orange. The two men exchanged a sober look and then Leeds knocked, rapping the door hard.\n\u201cIt\u2019s open!\u201d boomed a voice from inside. Upon entering, Murchison and Leeds could see the huge man, fourteen stone if an ounce and barely any of it fat, hunched over an impossibly tiny instrument, or so it seemed next to its ogrish owner. He waved a meaty hand at them without looking up. \u201cCome in! I\u2019m watching crystals.\u201d\nCloaks removed and folded atop a sturdy table, they walked over to their host, crossing in front of a huge fireplace now barely warm with a feeble, flickering fire. The mountain-like man looked up. \u201cMy friends! Glad to see you!\u201d His hand thrust forth and gripped Leeds\u2019, his wincing smile a combination of warmth and trepidation. Murchison waved cheerily and asked \u201cWhat are the crystals doing?\u201d\n\u201cStrange and wonderful things,\u201d exclaimed Little Billy. \u201cI\u2019ve been making notations and quick sketches all morning and by Jove if they don\u2019t act like they have a mind of their own! Not one of a higher quality such as ours, but most definitely a rudimentary one.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d Leeds peered into the microscope and discovered it was actually larger than his own.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the patterns and behavior, Leeds. They make specific designs and adapt them to changing conditions.\u201d\n\u201cHave you considered other factors, such as temperature or pressure?\u201d Murchison rubbed his small pipe absently.\n\u201cOf course! But even with those factors taken into account, there remains the mystery of their order and organization. I feel there\u2019s something more here than meets the eye.\u201d His massive arms waved in rythmic fashion, his eyes distant. \u201cSilica and carbon do have their similarities\u2026\u201d\nLeeds clapped the huge man on his shoulder. Then again. \u201cYou wired us about \u2018spirits and beasts\u2019?\u201d\nLike a flash, Little Billy came to. \u201cIndeed! I have some reports around here that are just your cup of tea.\u201d Murchison perched a hip on the table expecting a longish wait, then snapped back to his feet as Little Billy whipped a packet of papers into his partner\u2019s hands. \u201cHere. Clipped most of \u2018em myself. I even wrote you a brief report so you can steal a march on it.\u201d He beamed with obvious pride.\nLeeds glanced at the topmost paper, covered with oddly tiny writing:\nLocal farmers and citizens (Queer phrase, thought Leeds) have reported sightings of two mysterious creatures. The origins of both sets of sightings occur nearly on the same date, about three months ago. One creature is called \u201cspirit\u201d, \u201cghost\u201d, \u201cphantom\u201d or \u201cwraith\u201d. It appears mostly around buildings, in the towns and villages northeast of London. It has not attacked anyone or damaged property, but its presence is described as \u201cmenacing\u201d nonetheless. The other creature is more terrifying, having been sighted as it devours small animals such as dogs, cats and the occasional bird. It\u2019s described as \u201chideous\u201d, \u201crepulsive\u201d and \u201cwith worms crawling on it.\u201d The remains of its meals are literally shreds as it apparently tears at flesh with gruesome ferocity. In nearly every sighting, it has been described as moving slowly at first and then with incredible speed. No humans have been attacked.\nLeeds glanced up to find Murchison reading over his shoulder. Their eyes met and the memory of a hideous night was clearly revealed.\n\u201cReport useful?\u201d\nBoth men nodded slowly. \u201cQuite, old fellow. We\u2019ll read the clippings, mind you, but only for details. The situation is summed up quite nicely.\u201d Leeds felt his hand shake as he pushed the papers into his pocket.\nLittleBilly clapped his hands, startling his guests. \u201cVery well. Carry on! You will let me know the results, won\u2019t you? There seems to be a pretty mystery in there.\u201d\nMurchison\u2019s face soured for a second. \u201cYou\u2019ll know when we know.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to be joining us, would you?\u201d\nThe human bear shook his head slowly. \u201cI would like to, but Mum is not feeling her best and at times like this I like to stay close to her.\u201d His face was drawn.\nLeeds and Murchison exchanged shrugs. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave you to your crystals and keep us posted on that. In the meantime, we\u2019ll look into these reports and see what comes about.\u201d Leeds started to offer his hand and then changed it to a sloppy military salute.\nLittle Billy eyed them closely. \u201cMethinks you know already. Or if you don\u2019t know, you have a jolly good idea.\u201d There was no mirth in eyes or words.\nNod. \u201cIt seems familiar, old fellow. That\u2019s all we know for sure.\u201d Leeds rubbed his eyes in distraction. \u201cThat\u2019s why we feel the need to hurry.\u201d\nThey shook hands in gentler fashion and Little Billy walked them to the door. Before opening it, he stopped. \u201cYou know I\u2019d go with you if I could. But Mum has no one else\u2026\u201d\nMurchison lay his hand on the man\u2019s massive shoulder, reaching up to do so. \u201cWe know that as well as you. Take good care of her and we\u2019ll be back to share supper with both of you very soon.\u201d\nThe phenomenologists started across the windy yard, feeling a deeper chill than the new clouds could provide. A massive stage whisper pulled them up short.\n\u201cNot on Thursday,\u201d breathed the huge man. \u201cMum makes Yorkshire pudding on Thursdays and it\u2019s just dreadful!\u201d\nMurchison chuckled to accompany Leeds grin. \u201cThank you for the warning! Any night but Thursday!\u201d Leeds waved his thanks and saw, in a brief second, how Little Billy\u2019s eyes deepened with some unnamed emotion as he turned to leave.\nCHAPTER THREE\n\u201cYou won\u2019t tell Abilene, will you?\u201d\nThe office fire was crackling and sputtering. Murchison was leaning on his messy desk, having cleared a space large enough to perch a hip. Leeds sat at his orderly desk, the clippings and report spread across its shiny walnut surface in tidy rows and columns.\n\u201cI tell her everything. You know that.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know that and you don\u2019t tell her everything.\u201d He struck a match. \u201cJulie.\u201d\nMurchison watched through the wisps of smoke as Leeds blushed a deep red. He cleared his throat and coughed. \u201cGranted. But I must tell her about this. She was there, you know.\u201d\nNod. \u201cBut not present. She was unconscious and knows nothing about that beast or what it might be capable of.\"\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even know, Murchison. All we remember is that the elves were apparently very frightened of it.\u201d\n\u201cThose \u2018elves\u2019, said Murchison, drawing out the word, \u201cWere either hunters or murderers, if there is any distinction when talking about sentient beings.\u201d\n\u201cYou think this beast is sentient?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d snapped Murchison, \u201cBut I know that girl is, that we are and that they harmed her and tried to harm us. That makes them criminals in my mind.\u201d\nLeeds nodded gently. \u201cAnd yet it does nothing to define what this creature might be.\u201d\nMurchison strode over and jabbed a finger at certain clippings as he spoke. \u201cKilled a dog. A cat. A guinea fowl. A mastiff in this latest attack, just this week. If it has the speed to catch a guinea fowl and the power to rip a hound like this in half, it is a dangerous beast. We both know what we saw up on that airship and it can\u2019t be anything but a carnivore. Here\u2019s the proof.\u201d His pipe waved over the desk.\nLeeds sighed. \u201cI believe you\u2019re right. But how did it get off that ship? I\u2019m sure your shots were fatal. And if they weren\u2019t, it certainly must have been badly wounded.\u201d\nMurchison\u2019s voice rose in pitch. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what might have happened to it. Wherever that creature came from it certainly has no close cousin on our world. For all we know it might thrive on injuries or even on lead. It might be able to transmogrify itself through solid matter or become invisible.\u201d He sucked at the pipe and snarled in disgust as it went out.\nA small smile. \u201cYour theories are flying afield. But that has merit, at times. What if the so-called spirit is the beast in its invisibility guise?\u201d\nA larger smile. \u201cNow whose theories are flying into the ether? On the other hand, Occam would dictate that what you say is true. It would account for the description of the spirit as menacing and for the way it seems to build speed slowly and then apparently disappear.\u201d\nA long silence. \u201cIf that\u2019s true,\u201d murmured Leeds, \u201cThen how do we attack it?\u201d\n\u201cOr trap it.\u201d\nLeeds\u2019 eyes nearly bulged out. \u201cTrap it? I thought you\u2019d want to destroy it!\u201d\nMurchison nodded. \u201cI do. Particularly now that it appears to be growing in strength, speed and cunning. A mastiff is no easy prey\u2026\u201d He tapped his pipe into his other hand. \u201cBut it is an alien creature and a worthy subject for study.\u201d\n\u201cDead or alive. It makes no difference except that dead makes it a much safer subject.\u201d\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re to learn all we can from it just in death? Is life itself, in a form unlike any we may know, not worthy of our best effort?\u201d\nLeeds shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve always argued both sides of an issue, my friend. In this one I feel we should do away with advancing Science and try our best to stop this creature. If we can.\u201d\nA wry smile twisted thinned lips. \u201cIf the elves could do it, so can we. And we did stop the other one.\u201d A shudder was repressed through force of will. \u201cBarely.\u201d\n\u201cAt least this time we\u2019ll be better prepared for it. But we must be careful to pass unnoticed as we track the creature. No sense in alarming the folks.\u201d\n\u201cOr Abilene.\u201d\nA pause and then a gentle nod. \u201cOr Abilene.\u201d\nCHAPTER FOUR\nThe two men had selected heavy woolen cloaks, cut short to leave their legs free, and soft felt hats. Leeds had located his mahogany sword-cane, a gift from his late Uncle Hemero, a decidedly eccentric influence on his life. He had polished the dusky wood with care, and checked the blade for any signs of corrosion. Murchison had tilted his head at the selection of weapon.\n\u201cThat is either the choice of a very brave or very pessimistic man.\u201d\nLeeds nodded, then shook his head. \u201cPessimistic?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think we\u2019ll find the creature.\u201d\nLeeds looked thoughtfully across the huge bookshelves lining the opposite wall. \u201cYou might be right. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m that brave.\u201d\nMurchison snorted. \u201cYou neither lack courage nor optimism. I believe you\u2019re searching for an answer in a familiar source. Or quite truly, what\u2019s left of him.\u201d\nThe cloth polished for a few more strokes with pensive pace. \u201cTo think you never benefitted from a public education.\u201d\nMurchison started, then flashed a quick smile. \u201cLucky guess.\u201d\nLeeds stood, hefting the sword-cane in quick slashes. \u201cNot luck. Deduction. And keen eyes. I should hope to do half as well reading you, my friend. Half as well.\u201d He paced over to his desk opened a small drawer near the base and removed an oilskin-wrapped package. He unraveled it to reveal a small gun, of graceful lines and short barrel. With deft motions, he loaded four heavy bullets into it, snapped it and checked the balance.\n\u201cNow that\u2019s brave. A four-shot. I would\u2019ve expected you to\u2014\u201c\n\u201cA Colt? Like you? Six shots that could fell a tiger at fifty paces?\u201d\nMurchison nodded. \u201cExactly.\u201d He tapped his right side. \u2018Loaded and at hand.\u201d\nLeeds tucked the cloth-wrapped gun inside the cloak, adjusting its balance carefully. \u201cSix shots versus four. Distance versus accuracy.\u201d He raised a hand to forestall response. \u201cYes, I know we\u2019ve discussed the accuracy of those American pistols and I still believe they are fired more with inspiration than skill. I grant you the distance, but I\u2019m concerned with one thing. The creature\u2019s speed. We might not get a shot at it, much less six. Maybe not even four.\u201d He checked his cloak again. \u201cI hope we have the chance for one.\u201d\nLips drawn into a thin line Murchison grapped the heavy walking stick that lay across his desk like a petrified snake. \u201cOne should suffice, whether by inspiration,\u201d slight emphasis on the last word \u201cOr skill.\u201d He looked somberly at Leeds. \u201cWhat did you tell Abilene if I may be so forward?\u201d\nLeeds waved a hand in casual dismissal. \u201cThat we were to observe strange reactions in farm animals up near Lowden Grounds.\u201d\nA tightening of jaw. \u201cDid she believe you?\u201d\nLeeds ran a hand through his thinning brown hair. \u201cI\u2019m sure she did.\u201d A deep breath. \u201cI have never actually lied to her before.\u201d He shook his head and shrugged. \u2018Shall we go?\u201d\nThe night promised to be damp and chilly, the late October wind and fog making its presence felt with cloying fingers. During the trip the two men discussed tactics: Where to start the search, how to effect it, what to do if they spotted either spirit or beast and how to conceal their true mission from the local townfolk.\nThe area near K________ Manse, an old hostelry bought by Lord P____ in the XVth century had been turned into a gentleman\u2019s farm. Its rolling and heavily-forested grounds stretched between two small villages to the northeast and the west with London at its southern border. Two other houses of similar construction were set on the perimeter of the forest, creating a virtual enclosure of time past. Only one road crossed the forest in a north-south direction and one badly rutted cart trail meandered east to west.\nThe two men arrived after the moon had risen, its heavy roundness only slightly nicked by a sliver of inky black. As planned, they had skirted as much of the southern properties as possible arriving at the forest\u2019s edge feeling safe in their concealment. Most of the sightings of the beast had ocurred around the edges of the forest leading them to believe that it actually hid inside the difficult terrain and came out to feed. On that assumption, they headed the single-horse carriage slowly into the forest, heading north into a rising wind.\n\u201cThe horse may be able to warn us.\u201d The voice was low and tight.\n\u201cWe must make sure it doesn\u2019t bolt on us. That would be at best, inconvenient.\u201d Murchison\u2019s hands tugged slightly at the reins and the horse immediately slowed its pace. \u201cHe seems calm now.\u201d\nLeeds nodded in the dark. His mind ran over the articles noting how the spirit favored the villages and farms. Its form and sightings seemed to indicate it was the stalking method of the beast, so Leeds spent several minutes devising a way to trap it in that form.\nSuddenly, the horse snorted violently, lurching hard to the right. Both men snapped upward, their eyes searching the trees and grasses for evidence of movement. Leeds shaded his eyes, aware that the horse had begun trembling.\n\u201cThe moon is not that bright\u201d hissed Murchison.\n\u201cNot the moon. The shimmer of the spirit is what I\u2019m trying to catch.\u201d\nMurchison, holding tightly to the reins, leaped from the carriage and started whispering to the horse, whose muscles were tight and spastic. Blowing softly into its nose and murmuring, Murchison managed to calm the horse slightly. Leeds had stepped down and was slowly making his way up the smooth slippery road, eyes darting in every direction with intensity. He was unaware that his left hand was holding the sword-cane and his right was resting on the gun in his cloak pocket. Later he could not even remember when he had unwrapped it.\nAs Leeds was returning to the carriage, the horse screamed and rose up slashing the air viciously with its hooves, barely missing Murchison. The tall man tried valiantly to hold the animal down, but its wide-open eyes showed white all around and its shrieks of panic were evidence of a deep, primal fear. Lunging and bucking, even with Leeds holding the reins, the animal managed to twist the carriage onto its side and with a series of powerful thrusts, broke free, all the while screaming its agony to the night. It bolted at a dead run, neck stretched and legs scrabbling for speed down the road and into the darkness.\nLeeds held a piece of the reins in his hands. He gazed at it wonderingly, relieved the leather had broken before the horse dragged him. Murchison came over. \u201cAre you injured?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Are you?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Just my pride.\u201d\nLeeds tossed the strap into the grass. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be. Apollo himself couldn\u2019t have calmed that horse down. I\u2019ve never heard such fear before.\u201d They glanced around, each taking a section of the forest. The night sounds were muted. The wind blew steadily, trying to find a way through the cloaks and the damp air was beginning to make itself felt on their faces.\n\u201cProceed on foot?\u201d\n\u201cWe have a long walk ahead of us.\u201d Leeds pulled the gun out of his pocket. \u201cWe should take advantage of the moon for at least two or three hours.\u201d\nMurchison nodded and also palmed his gun. \u201cOur advantage is also the beast\u2019s.\u201d Leeds glanced at his partner. \u201cBut it is two against one.\u201d\nThey separated several feet, placing as much of the road between them as possible. They hoped to reduce the ability of the beast to attack them at the same time.\nNot twenty paces had they proceeded when Leeds suddenly doubled over, retching horribly as he was driven into the ground. Murchison caught the glimmer of a gelid mass atop his partner. He ran a few steps and launched himself at the translucent mass, feeling a shock of cold as his hands slammed into it.\n<painhungerneedhungerfood>\nLeeds struggled mightily to free himself from the spirit\u2019s grasp while Murchison, retching in powerful spasms, pounded the cold creature with aimless blows.\n<needhungerhungerpain>\nMurchison felt a gap between the two struggling beings and managed to wedge his arm in it. Rising unsteadily, he braced his legs and pulled as hard as he could. The cold weight of the creature numbed his arm as his effort paid off: Leeds was freed.\nIn the moonlit dark, Murchison felt rather than saw the creature flop onto the near grass. He raised his gun at the slithering sound of its approach.\n\u201cSto--!\u201d gagged Leeds, his hand clutching at Murchison\u2019s leg. \u201cNo!\u201d\nMurchison cocked the gun.\n\u201cNO!\u201d Leeds dragged his friend to the ground.\nThe translucent creature, its surface glimmering with winks of light both near and far stopped within an arm\u2019s length of both men.\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026hungry,\u201d gasped Leeds, coughing breathlessly.\nMurchison held his partner up. \u201cThat seems obvious, for it attacked us.\u201d\n\u201cNot\u2026attack.\u201d Leeds coughed for several seconds. \u201cWarning.\u201d\nThe creature stirred and Murchison aimed at it with deadly purpose. \u201cWarning?\u201d\nLeeds nodded, his entire body rocking in assent. \u201cBeast\u2026is nearby. Not this\u2026creature.\u201d Heavy coughs wracked Leeds until he was able to breathe deeply. After a minute, he had recovered enough to speak.\n\u201cThis creature is also from the airship.\u201d Both men glanced over at it and the glimmers changed in both rhythm and clarity. \u201cI believe it too is hunting.\u201d\n\u201cHunting? Has it killed some of the animals we read about?\u201d\nLeeds shook his head emphatically. \u201cIt is hunting the beast.\u201d\nMurchison stared. \u201cHow do you know this? Or do you?\u201d\n\u201cDid you\u2026hear, or feel something when you touched it?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWas it something like\u2014pain, hunger, a certain urgency to the pain?\u201d\nMurchison shuddered at the memory. \u201cYes. Quite.\u201d\nLeeds nodded. \u201cI felt that the moment it hit me. I also felt, and maybe even saw, the images of the airship and the beast.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cAnd then a I got the sense that this\u2014spirit, for want of a better word\u2014was trying to help me.\u201d\nThe creature seemed to flatten and elongate slightly, rising a few feet above the damp grass. It\u2019s shape shifted slightly, but overall retained a teardrop shape, with the narrow end at its base.\nLeeds reached out to it.\n\u201cCareful.\u201d\nContact.\n<needfoodfoodneedfood>\nLeeds pulled his hand back. \u201cIt says it needs food.\u201d His voice was shaky.\nMurchison pursed his lips. \u201cWhat does it eat?\u201d\nLeeds sighed. Then again. And in a soft voice he said: \u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, it eats intelligence.\u201d\nCHAPTER FIVE\nIt was a rare sight: Murchison threw back his head and laughed. Even in the dark, Leeds\u2019 blush was visible, his chagrined expression a fuel for Murchison\u2019s mirth.\nAfter too long, Murchison wound down, his breath a trifle shaky. \u201cLeeds, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2014I shouldn\u2019t have been so\u2026free, with my feelings.\u201d\nLeeds waved a hand, his expression tight.\nMurchison laid a hand on his friend\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI truly am sorry. I\u2019m sure you have an excellent reason for saying that.\u201d His eyes danced merrily. \u201cBut you must admit it not only sounds strange, it, uh, sounds as if you were not\u2014\u201c, a happy chuckle, \u201cNutritious enough.\u201d The grin split into another chuckle.\nLeeds chuckled softly. \u201cMuch as it may hurt to admit, that turned out well for me.\u201d He rubbed a hand across his face. \u201cThe sense I get is that this creature here is hungry for\u2014energy or something intangible such as that.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you say that? What did it tell you?\u201d\nA shrug. \u2018It didn\u2019t tell me anything. I guess it isn\u2019t intelligent enough for speech. But just as a dog can tell its master it wants to go out for a walk or that there\u2019s a burglar downstairs, then this creature made me understand it is hungry for that\u2026substance.\u201d He spread his hands out helplessly. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to express it clearly.\u201d\n\u201cEnergy or substance?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d\n\u201cLeeds, why is it so upsetting? Did I offend you greatly?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, no. Murchison, this feeling is more than hunger.\u201d Leeds started to pace and the creature floated to and fro, staying equidistant to both men. \u201cThere\u2019s a great sense of loneliness, of despair, almost\u2026panic. Desperation. I can\u2019t really say it properly.\u201d\nMurchison glanced at the spirit being, its glimmering shape fading into the dark as the moon was obscured by thin clouds. \u201cYou feel it is intelligent?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018intelligent\u2019? By whose standards?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. The only standard we can use is our own, that of humans. Is it as intelligent as you or I?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe, maybe not. I barely\u2014\u201c\nThe slamming of the spirit beast into both men happened at the same time as a bloodcurdling roar of unearthly power washed into their bones. Murchison toppled onto Leeds, their combined momentum rolling them over the dewy grass. A fetid wave of air filled their lungs as the beast barely missed its attack.\nA heavy pause, filled with terror. Leeds, on his knee, felt frozen. Murchison rose slowly, his gun forgotten. The nightmare was back. The beast was smaller than its predecessor, but moved with a crackling energy, almost prancing in its desire to hunt and kill. Its jagged, scaly skin was veined with cracks that seeped a viscous fluid. On its back were open sores, like small moist mouths that opened and closed rhythmically. The eyes, a yellowish-orange with no pupils, were fixed on its prey, the entire creature almost quivering in anticipation. The mouth, gaping, revealed jagged teeth in double rows and the rounded hole of its nose flicked its small tentacles blindly.\nMurchison turned and ran. \u201cShoot it, Leeds!\u201d he roared.\nLeeds pulled his gun and watched in horror as the beast ripped across the shadowy space and crashed into Murchison, driving the man into the ground like a cat with a sickly mouse. Somehow, he was able to turn and kick at the beast with all his might, throwing it back a few feet. Murchison scrabbled away from the predator. \u201cShoot! I lost my gun!\u201d\nLeeds pulled the trigger, once, twice, again and again. The solitary click was like the clack of doom as the beast remained standing, eyes fixed on Murchison, breath misting in the damp night.\nThe beast leaped and Murchison braced for its savagery. Leeds roared, a primal hoarse scream of defiance and charged.\nMurchison disappeared beneath the beast, then his scream of pain broke through the night. Leeds slammed his shoulder into the creature, his body absorbing a thunderous impact and he heard, he heard the flesh tearing from Murchison.\nIn a flash, the creature swiped at Leeds, its lengthy claws gouging furrows in his arm and neck. The warm stickiness flowed quickly and the hideous roar pierced their souls again.\nLeeds stumbled and fell, clutching at his neck to staunch the flow. Suddenly, a weight crushed his chest, stabbing pains forcing the air from his lungs. In calm wonder, he came face to face with alien death, the second stretching into near-eternity.\nThunderous blasts, muffled but earth-shaking, vibrated through Leeds. One. Then two more. The weight suddenly increased, then it was gone.\nLeeds rolled away from the inert creature, gasping for breath. He came to his feet, swaying badly.\nA soft thump made him turn. Lying face down in the grass was Murchison. Leeds reached out to him, gingerly. \u201cMurchison? Are you all right?\u201d\nHe rolled his friend over and gasped. Most of Murchison\u2019s left arm and chest were gone, the glistening flesh and shiny white bones a macabre sentence of death.\nLeeds sobbed, ripping off his cloak to wrap around his friend, ignoring the quicker flow of blood from his own wounds. He looked around desperately for branches, thinking that only a travois would help him move Murchison fast enough to\u2026help him.\nA soft push. The spirit creature was hovering above them. Leeds reached out to it instinctively, a pleading gesture of help.\nContact.\n<feedhurtfeedheal>\nLeeds pulled away, gasping in pain.\nHe reached out again.\nHelp us.\n<helpfoodfoodhelphurtheal>\nLeeds collapsed.\nWith barely any strength left, he opened his eyes and saw the spirit creature float over to the dead beast and settle upon it. Like a blanket, it covered the body, slightly obscuring its details. And then, with a gurgling sound of happy water, the beast began to melt. Slowly its outline smoothed out, softened and then dissolved into a grayish mass. The spirit creature didn\u2019t grow or thicken. It continued its task until it rested heavily on the grass.\nLeeds felt Murchison\u2019s breathing change from ragged to rasping, a throaty rattle that signaled an ending was near. Desperate strength flooded through him and he sat up, grasping Murchison\u2019s hand. \u201cHold on, Stephen. Hold on!\u201d\nThe limp grasp told Leeds his message would go unheeded.\nCHAPTER SIX\nLeeds held back the tears with great effort. He carefully placed his friend\u2019s hand under the cloak and tried to stand up.\nContact.\n<helpheal>\nLeeds, in disbelief, understood.\nOnce again he saw the spirit cover a body. With great caution, the body was rolled over, exposing the gruesome wounds. Slowly, like rolling swirls in murky water, Leeds saw the wounds fill in, going from bloody to raw. In time, bones were covered and flesh came together, melting together into muscle and fascia, until a chest and arm were restored.\nLeeds drew a deep breath, unaware that he had held it. The spirit shimmered. It grew darker, as if smoke had flooded its flesh. Then with a convulsive heave, Murchison started coughing.\nThe spirit hovered above them again. Murchison continued coughing and Leeds could barely keep from pounding his back.\nLeeds reached up to the spirit creature. It flowed onto his arm.\n<healfoodneedpainheal>\nLeeds nodded. The gelid mass flowed to cover his wounds and he felt the tiny pinpricks of some unseen icy needles knitting his flesh. He was vaguely aware that Murchison was taking in the scene with open-mouthed astonishment.\nThe healing was completed. The spirit flowed off of Leeds and floated down to the grass.\nMurchison was still in awe. \u201cIt did that to me?\u201d\nLeeds resisted the urge to embrace him. \u201cYes,\u201d he nodded. And so much more.\n\u201cHow?\u201d\nLeeds shrugged. \u201cWe may never know. Like so many other mysteries in our paths.\u201d\n\u201cIs it all right?\u201d\nLeeds glanced at the limpid creature. \u201cPerhaps. It might not know its limits.\u201d\n\u201cBut we have to grant it knows more than we expect.\u201d Murchison knelt next to the spirit, observing it closely.\nLeeds shook his head. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nThe tall man stood up and Leeds thrilled at the sight of his easy motion. \u201cDo you remember me shouting at you that I\u2019d lost my gun? My apologies for that, by the way.\u201d\nLeeds\nchuckled. \u201cNo harm done, I guess. Yes, I remember that.\u201d\nMurchison pointed. \u201cThat creature brought it to me. That\u2019s how I was able to kill the beast.\u201d Murchsion peered into the darkness. \u201cWhere is it? Did it escape?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d This time Leeds pointed. \u201cIt dissolved the beast. Apparently that was the food it craved.\u201d\n\u201cAll of it?\u201d\nA nod. \u201cEvery cell from what I can see.\u201d\nMurchison pondered for a few seconds. \u201cThere must be a lot of energy in a creature such as that.\u201d\nLeeds nodded. A sudden gust of wind made him shiver. Murchison handed over the bloodied cloak with a quiet \u201cThanks\u201d and Leeds drew it on quickly. \u201cWe have a long walk, Murchison. Shall we make an early start?\u201d\nArranging his torn clothing as best he could, Murchison replied: \u201cIndeed. And what shall we do about the spirit?\u201d\nAs if in response, it floated up a few feet, resuming its teardrop shape. To both men it seemed more\u2026alive.\n\u201cI believe it will choose its own destiny.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of room in your house.\u201d\nLeeds nodded. \u201cAnd it may turn out to be one mystery we might be able to fully explain after all.\u201d\nMurchison took a deep breath and let it out slowly. \u201cWhere do you think they came from?\u201d\nThey fell into step, walking steadily, as the spirit hovered above them. \u201cThey might be from different places.\u201d His eyes opened wide in wonder. \u201cMaybe even from different times!\u201d\nMurchison smiled. \u201cAh, the speculation begins.\u201d His hand reached for his pipe. \u201cBlast! I lost my pipe!\u201d\nLeeds patted his friend\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI lost my sword-cane. Tomorrow we can replace both at Bessemer\u2019s. For now, let\u2019s ponder the mysteries of this night.\u201d\nContact. Contact.\n<safedistancetimeneedsafe>\nThey looked at each other. \u201cBeyond\u2014\u201c\n\u201cOrion,\u201d finished Murchison. They stood still. \u201cWe may explain this one yet,\u201d he said quietly, his voice dropping to a whisper.\nAnd their long walk continued in silence.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050906051005\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/octdec2000\/beast.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The fourth in Gil C.

It had to be.\nNo\ndoubt both the original telegram and the brightly coloured thing floating\nin the cove below were some rustic eccentric\u2019s idea of a joke. Dawson had only\nbeen sent on this wild goose chase as revenge for the affair with Alice.\nHe\nsteadied his bowler on his head and leaned forward to speak to the young man who\nhad picked him up from the station. Perhaps the boy knew how he could get down\nthe cliff to get a closer look at the wretched contraption.\n\u201cSir?\u201d\nDawson\nturned to meet the intense gaze of a heavily built man with light brown skin,\nhigh cheekbones and jet-black hair. He forced his face into a welcoming smile\nand jumped from the cart. Mud spattered up his trouser leg.\n\u201cMr...Ar..Ahuitzotl,\nI presume?\u201d Dawson resisted the urge to extend a hand in case the chap thought\nit was some sort of insult. He looked like a U.A.S citizen, just as the telegram\nhad claimed; best not take chances. \u201cI am James Dawson, administrative\nassistant to Commodore Gordon Cameron, head of the Transportation Research\nDivision in His Majesty's Ministry of War.\u201d\n\u201cYou\nare Cameron\u2019s secretary?\u201d The visitor\u2019s accent made it hard for Dawson to\nwork out whether he was being patronized or complimented. \u201cThe Commodore\nhimself did not come, then.\u201d\n\u201cCommodore\nCameron is an extremely busy man. Your telegram was somewhat...vague, and he had\nno way of checking your credentials without risking diplomatic complications. If\nyou had come directly to London, he may well have met you in person.\u201d And I\nwould not have to stand on this windy cliff-top being insulted by you.\n\u201cIf\nI had come to London I would already be dead, Mr Dawson.\u201d\nThe Aztecan spoke calmly, as though his life were not overly important to\nhim, and Dawson\nfound himself looking along the rugged coastline to avoid the visitor\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cHowever,\nin the same situation, I also would be cautious. But as you are the first\nrepresentative of the British Government I have encountered since my arrival, it\nis to you that I must state my plea.\u201d\nHe\npaused, then held his hands out in front of him, palms up. He tilted his head\ntowards the sky, closed his eyes, and started to speak, \u201cI am Ahuitzotl, child\nof Acamapichtli of the city of Tetzcoco. My Caste is Pochteca, my Clan is\nItzconatzin. I have knowledge of the ways of those who were once my enemies, and\nI have an artifact of those who were once my people. I ask you, James Dawson of\nLondon, as a representative of your King, Edward, to grant me sanctuary in this\nland from now until I die. I offer my fealty and my knowledge, and all material\ngoods which I have brought with me. I renounce citizenship of the Empire of the\nSun, which you call the United Aztecan States, in favour of any claims you wish\nto make on me. On your word, I am reborn.\u201d\nIn\nthe ensuing silence Dawson was acutely aware of water seeping into his shoe, of\nthe heat of the sun, and of how ill-equipped he was to deal with what was\nobviously rather more than a simple example of Cornish humour. Damn Cameron for\ntaking Dawson\u2019s interest in his niece as a personal insult! But he was by\nhimself here, so he had better try and placate the foreigner. \u201cEr, yes. Well,\nthis is rather outside my jurisdiction, I\u2019m afraid. You really need to speak\nto someone from the Foreign Office.\u201d The Aztecan seemed not to have heard him.\nHe tried speaking up a bit, \u201cTerribly sorry I can\u2019t help you, old chap, but\nthere it is.\u201d\nThe\nAztecan opened his eyes and shrugged. \u201cI thought you would say something like\nthat.\u201d His tone was casual. \u201cNo matter. You have heard my request, even if\nyou cannot grant it.\u201d He looked past Dawson, \u201cThomas, please secure the cart\nand accompany us down to the cove. Shall we go, Mr Dawson?\u201d\n\u201cGo\nwhere, precisely?\u201d\n\u201cTo\nsee if I have something worth trading for\nBritish citizenship.\u201d The Aztecan smiled, and Dawson noticed laughter\nlines around the man's eyes. He had assumed Ahuitzotl was younger than him, but\nit seemed he might be slightly older. \u201cPlease take care: the path is a little\nslippery in places.\u201d\nDawson\nfollowed the Aztecan down the cliff, noting with mild distaste that though he\nhad adopted European clothes his hair hung over his collar. \u201cI must say, er,\nAhuitzotl, I really am quite impressed by your grasp of English. I thought your\npeople rarely learnt other languages.\u201d Actually, Whitehall gossip claimed that\nthe UAS ambassador, Nethual...whatsisname, understood English perfectly well,\nbut still used a translator when he spoke to his hosts. Then again, he also\nturned up at official functions wearing patterned blankets, animal skins and\nfeathers, regardless of the weather or the potential offence to any ladies\npresent.\n\u201cMr\nDawson, I speak English well because I am Pochteca.\u201d Ahuitzotl slowed at a\nswitchback in the path. \u201cI am, or rather was, a merchant. You work for the War\nMinistry so you understand what that means, I assume.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nDawson stopped, grabbing a stunted tree for support. \u201cOf course. I see.\nA...merchant.\u201d A spy, rather. It was people like this, as much as their\nfearsome soldiers, which had allowed the U.A.S. to conquer half a continent.\nAhuitzotl\nlooked up at Dawson across the gorse, \u201cI learnt English, and Spanish, in\nSierra, where I lived under a false identity between the ages of twenty four and\ntwenty nine. I have travelled extensively in Louisiana, New England and Canada.\nAnd it is as you think. In my old life I performed acts of espionage and\nterrorism. But that is the past. You must understand that. You are not a\nstudent of our culture, I cannot expect you to understand the importance of the\nwords I spoke on the cliff-top. I renounced everything, my home, my culture, my\nnation. I am not who I was.\u201d\nHe made a small cutting gesture with his hand and strode off down the\npath.\nDawson\nglanced back up the cliff, where sparse white clouds raced over the grassy lip,\nthen released his grip on the tree and scrambled after the Aztecan.\nAhuitzotl\nwaited at the base of the path, looking out over the waves that flopped and\nsucked across the shingle. He spoke without turning. \u201cI am sorry, Mr Dawson.\nIf I am to live amongst the English I must do a better job of adopting English\nways. I am a little too forward in my speech. Please forgive me.\u201d\n\u201cOf\ncourse.\u201d Dawson wondered briefly whether this apparent frankness marked the\nman as a deceiver of consummate skill.\nAhuitzotl\nswept a hand out to indicate the strange device out in the cove. \u201cMr Dawson,\nmay I present to you, and your government, the \u2018Cloud Serpent\u2019, the only\npowered flying craft in existence in the world at this time.\u201d\nIt had a cylindrical body bisected by a flat plank, which presumably\nformed the wings; some sort of a box on legs squatted over the point where the\nwings crossed the body. \u201cIf you will follow me, I will prove my claim.\u201d\n\u201cI'm\nnot entirely sure I understand your intentions here,\u201d said Dawson, worried\nthat he did.\n\u201cI\nwould like you to fly with me to London.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\nwait a minute, sir. I really don't think I am the man for this. I am no\nengineer: I would have no way of assessing how well the machine functions.\u201d\n\u201cI\nwould have thought that determining how well it functions is simple enough.\nEither it flies, or it does not. The fact that I am here implies that it\ndoes.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\nof course, but I really...\u201d Dawson found himself taking a step backwards.\n\u201cSurely you could just take it out for a, well, a fly, while I wait here and\nwatch.\u201d\n\u201cI\nunderstand your unease, but even if you are convinced, you have admitted\nyourself that you do not have authority to grant me asylum without consulting\nyour superiors. That will take time. I do not have time.\u201d\n\u201cSo\nyou keep saying. What exactly is the problem?\u201d\n\u201cIf\nI turn up in London unannounced and unaccompanied the British authorities will\nassume this is a trick, as you yourself probably do, and turn me over to the UAS\nembassy, who will kill me for having betrayed the Empire. If I stay here, the\nPochteca will soon find me. I know how effective Aztecan foreign agents are. I\nwas one. But if you fly to London with me you can act as my passport, if you\nwill. I would ask you to vouch for me, or at least for the value of the\ntechnology I bring.\u201d\n\u201cAnd\nif I decide not to go with you?\u201d\n\u201cThen\nI will ask Thomas to take you back to Penzance and I will fly to London alone,\nand face the consequences. But, Mr Dawson, surely this,\u201d he gestured at the\ncraft riding the swell of the bay, \u201cis one of the greatest adventures of the\nage. The chance to fly is not something many are offered. Are you not at least\ncurious?\u201d\n\u201cEr,\nwell, of course . . .\u201d Dawson ran his finger under his collar. Actually, he\nwas terrified. But he could imagine Cameron\u2019s face if he turned tail and ran\nnow. \u201cAll right dammit, I\u2019ll fly in your infernal machine.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\nVery good.\u201d Ahuitzotl turned and crunched off over the shingle to where Thomas\nstood by a rowing boat. Dawson glanced up at the sea-birds wheeling effortlessly\noverhead. He had always taken birds for granted.\nDawson\naddressed the Aztecan's retreating back. \u201cJust make sure your chap sends my\novernight bag back to London. I've left it in his cart.\u201d\nBy\nthe time he reached the boat the boy had taken his place on the rower\u2019s bench\nand the Aztecan was seated in the prow. \u201cI'm sorry to presume, Mr Dawson, but\nwould you be so kind as to push the boat off?\u201d\nDawson\ndid not see why Thomas couldn\u2019t do it, but he did as Ahuitzotl asked, even\nthough it left him soaked to the knees. He could always make an expenses claim\nfor a new pair of shoes when he returned to London.\nThomas\nstarted rowing with long confident strokes, his cheap jacket going taut across\nhis shoulders as he pulled on the oars. Dawson leaned round to see past the boy\nand peered at the \u2018Cloud Serpent\u2019. Ahuitzotl was leaning back in the prow.\n\u201cI imagine you have a few questions, Mr Dawson. Please, ask what you will.\u201d\nDawson\nthought of all the questions he could ask. There was very little to be gained\nfrom entering into any sort of verbal duel with the Aztecan, but neither did he\nwant to miss the chance for information gathering. He needed something harmless\nto get the man talking. He thought for a moment then said, \u201cWell, I can't help\nwondering...why is your craft green? It's rather, well, bright.\u201d\n\u201cBecause\ngreen is the colour of beings who fly. What other colour would we paint a flying\nmachine?\u201d At that moment they rowed out of the shadow of the cliff, and\nDawson, squinting at the Aztecan, thought he saw a quick smile.\nSo\nmuch for useful information. \u201cI must say that is precisely the sort of answer\nI would expect from one of your people! One might almost be think you were\nmocking me, sir.\u201d\n\u201cThe\nAzteca are no longer my people. I have not lied to you. I will not lie to you.\nLet me explain. Green is the colour which signifies flight, escape. For the\nChildren of the Sun, colour, place, and time are not matters of chance or whim:\nthey are the structure of the universe made real. An expression of cosmic order,\nif you like. I was not mocking you. I was smiling because I know how strange\nsuch ideas must seem to you. If I was mocking anyone, it was myself for being\nfool enough to think I could cross the gap between two cultures as easily as\ncrossing an ocean. Yet here I am.\u201d He spread his arms, as though encompassing\nthe sky and the cliffs, then favoured Dawson with a direct stare. \u201cDo you know\nwho\nHernan Cortes was, Mr Dawson?\u201d\n\u201cCortes?\nEr, no, never heard of him.\u201d The flying machine's growing presence beyond the\nAztecan\u2019s shoulder was becoming distracting.\n\u201cNo,\nI would not expect you to. He was a Spanish criminal who fled to the mainland\nfrom the Carib islands to avoid a death sentence. He was the first European to\nsee Tenochitlan, the heart of the Empire. He came with men and horses and guns,\nand he tried to abuse an ancient prophecy to gain power. Emperor Cuitlahuac saw\nhim for what he was: a lesson from the gods that the outside world would destroy\nus if it could. I suspect his late brother, Moctezuma, would not have been so\nwise. It would be heresy for me to say this in the Empire, but if the Azteca not\nacquired gunpowder and horses from Cortes the Empire would not have lasted four\nof your decades, let alone four centuries. Technology is power.\u201d\n\u201cAnd\nwhat happened to this Cortes chap?\u201d Dawson found his gaze drawn to the\n\u2018Cloud Serpent\u2019. The closer they got the less robust the thing looked. Wires\nwere strung between every surface, and the only substantial part was the box in\nthe centre, a complicated affair of greasy metal with some sort of wooden bar\nfixed across the back of it.\n\u201cWhat\ndo you think happened to him?\u201d\nDawson\ntore his gaze away from the flying machine. \u201cI would prefer not to\nspeculate.\u201d\n\u201cAll\npower, Mr Dawson, is in the heart. So Cuitlahuac ate his heart. We have a\nnational holiday to celebrate the event.\u201d\n\u201cCharming.\u201d\nDawson glanced at Thomas. His neutral expression was a credit to his class.\nAhuitzotl\nglanced over at his machine. \u201cCortes was a European, yet most Europeans have\nnot heard of him. To the Azteca, he is, well, not a hero, but a celebrity. What\nI am saying is the considerable differences between two cultures are merely a\nmatter of perspective. What is that quote? \u2018History is written by the\nvictors\u2019. We see the world as we are told to see it, because that is the path\nof least resistance. For the Azteca this occurs to a degree you would find hard\nto comprehend. But it is true for you too, you know.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\nI suppose it could be. Never really thought about it.\u201d They pulled alongside\none of the wings; a pontoon on the wingtip dipped down to the water to keep the\ncraft steady and stable. Ingenious.\nAhuitzotl\nsmiled at him.\n\u201cIt amazes me now that it is quite possible to go almost one\u2019s entire life\nwithout questioning one's beliefs. I would wish to see you so amazed.\u201d\n\u201cEr,\nthankyou.\u201d Dawson wondered if all his countrymen were as confusingly\nforthright as Ahuitzotl appeared to be.\nThe\nboat came round to nestle, prow first, in the angle between the wings and the\nbody of the craft. Thomas shipped the oars. The boat bobbed gently, not quite in\ntime with the rhythm of the \u2018Cloud Serpent\u2019. Ahuitzotl half stood and\ngrasped one of the legs that supported the box in the centre. \u201cI will get off\nfirst and sit down, then you can follow.\u201d\n\u201cGet\noff onto what, precisely?\u201d The low body of the craft appeared to be an\nunbroken cylinder, save for three small fins sticking out at the end behind\nDawson.\n\u201cLet me show you.\u201d Ahuitzotl turned and started to climb onto - no\ninto - the hollow body of the thing, directly below the metallic box. Apparently\none sat inside.\nHe\nreached out gingerly to touch the garishly coloured body. \u201cEr, Ahuitzotl, what\nexactly is this thing made of?\u201d\n\u201cThe\nengine, here,\u201d he nodded to indicate the box above his head, \u201cis a light\nalloy. The screen at the front is reinforced glass, and the base and frame are\nlayered wood. The covering, most of what you actually see, is waxed fabric. The\ntrick is getting the right ratio of power to weight.\u201d The Aztecan lowered\nhimself into the body of the craft, setting the boat rocking as his weight was\nremoved.\nDawson\nrather wished he hadn\u2019t asked. But there was no going back now. He half stood,\ncareful not to tip the balance of the boat. As he stepped over the rower\u2019s\nbench Thomas moved aside and said, \u201cI'll\nsee your bag gets sent back up to London Mr Dawson sir, don't you worry.\u201d\nDawson\neased himself into the craft. It was not that difficult: the \u2018Cloud Serpent\u2019\nsat so low in the water that its body rode beneath the rowing boat's prow. Once\nDawson was inside Thomas started to move the boat away. As Dawson watched at his\nlast safe route to land disappear, the boy smiled and shouted back, \u201cGood\nluck, sirs.\u201d Good Grief, was that envy in his eyes?\nAhuitzotl\ncrouched in front of him, \u201cPlease excuse the rather sparse accommodations.\nProper seats were a luxury that had to be left out to save weight and space.\nOnce we have her started you can use that bundle behind you containing my\nworldly goods as a backrest.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\nyes, I see it.\u201d So, this was the back end. Assuming one faced forward when it\nwas flying, of course. \u201cActually I'm rather surprised you built it with room\nfor a passenger, given what you said about weight.\u201d\n\u201cThe\nspace was originally intended for spare fuel and luggage. However the fact that\nit will accommodate two makes it more valuable from a military point of view.\nThe space could be used to house an observer, or a gunner. And I did not build\nthe \u2018Cloud Serpent\u2019. My son did.\u201d Ahuitzotl knelt up and started fiddling\nwith the engine. Dawson found himself staring at the man's midriff. \u201cI am\nafraid I am going to have to presume upon you again, Mr Dawson. I will prime the\nengine, but then we need to start the propeller. Given how cramped things are\nwith two of us in here, it might be easier if you reach up and do it.\u201d\nThe\npropeller? Of course! That was what the wooden thing was. Dawson turned, banging\nhis knee on one of the internal supports, then reached up for the wooden bar\nacross the back of the engine. He wished Alice could see him now: she often got\nirritated with the restraints and taboos of her upper class world and longed to\ndo something real, something physical. Of course she had, and so had he; and\nthat was why he was here now, performing contortions in a floating box with this\nmysterious foreigner. Perhaps his life needed a little more unpredictability,\njust as Alice had said when they spoke for the last time.\nA\nsweet, pungent odour brought him back to the task in hand.\n\u201cSorry\nabout the smell, Mr Dawson. Cane alcohol; engine fuel. Azteca technology has\nrather taken to the internal combustion engine. Now, when I tell you, please\npull the propeller round sharply in a clockwise direction. As soon as it catches\nyou must get your hand out of the way quickly and sit down. That's it. Now.\u201d\nDawson\ntugged the propeller. After some initial resistance, it spun free. The engine\nabove him coughed, then died. He caught the wooden paddle again.\n\u201cIt\nrarely starts first time, I fear. We will have to try again in a moment.\u201d\nDawson realised that Ahuitzotl's apparent impoliteness in making him push the\nrowing boat out had been a test. If he balked at getting wet feet there was no\nway he would be able to deal with this undignified and smelly procedure. \u201cNow,\nif you please, Mr Dawson.\u201d\nDawson\npulled again, harder, and this time the cough became a roar. He snatched his\nhand back from the whirring blades and sat down abruptly. The sweet smell became\nsharper, and pale smoke vented from the sides of the engine above. The noise was\ndeafening.\nAhuitzotl was fitting a wooden plank across the space between them for\nhis backrest; he shouted to be heard over the engine, \u201cYou might find it best\nto sit cross-legged, Mr Dawson.\u201d\nDawson adjusted his posture accordingly. He hadn't sat like this since he\nwas a child but he found it surprisingly comfortable.\n\u201cOnce\nwe start moving things will get a bit breezy. You may wish to remove your\nhat.\u201d\nDawson\nrealised he was still wearing his bowler. He took it off and placed it on his\nlap. He shouted back, \u201cWill it be this loud all the way to London?\u201d He was\nnot sure he would survive the journey if it was.\n\u201cNo,\nnot at all. It will much quieter once we take off: the engine position means\nthat much of the noise is swept backwards.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m\nglad to hear it. When we get to London, where\nwill you- we land.\u201d\n\u201cOn\nthe Thames somewhere near Greenwich: I would have preferred to come down outside\nthe Houses of Parliament, but there are too many bridges that far up. Are you\nready, Mr Dawson?\u201d\nNo,\nthought Dawson, but nodded anyway.\nAhuitzotl\nfaced forward again and pulled a lever beside him. The engine note changed and\nthe vibration increased. Dawson grabbed the edge of the craft. He was pressed\nback against the tarpaulin backrest, gently at first, then more firmly. The sea\nwas moving. No, they were moving. The \u2018Cloud Serpent\u2019 gained speed, and\nDawson felt his tailbone being bruised by the craft's tiny collisions with the\nwater beneath him. Then the vibration stopped, and there was a faint lifting\nsensation in his gut. The noise fell away, as though they were leaving the world\nof harsh sounds behind.\nHe\nwas flying!\nThey\nclimbed quickly. Below them Dawson glimpsed a tiny figure - Thomas - pulling the\nboat ashore. The high cliffs were a wall which they paralleled and passed\neffortlessly. Then they were over the headland, amongst the birds. The wind\ntugged at Dawson\u2019s hair. Some animal part of him kept track of the distance\nbetween his frail body and the cold hard sea. Strangely, the operation of this\nprimitive instinct did not scare him. It thrilled him, as though he were\ndreaming, and somehow indestructible.\nThey\ndipped over the headland into the next bay. The sea sparkled like a mat of\ndiamonds. Some of the birds followed them out over the cove for a while, curious\nto see who was invading their world.\nAs\nthey swept over the bay Ahuitzotl turned slightly, smiled, and raising his voice\nto be heard over the drone of the engine, said, \u201cDo you regret your decision,\nMr Dawson? You could be safe on the ground now, heading for the station.\u201d\nDawson\nfound himself smiling back at the Aztecan. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t regret it sir. Not\nat all. To fly in a craft built by man, to challenge the birds: who would have\nthought it possible?\u201d\nAhuitzotl\nlaughed, though the wind snatched most of the sound away. \u201cNot your master,\napparently.\u201d\nDawson\nlooked up. Overhead, the sun was pulling itself towards noon, burning off the\nlast of the clouds. Though Dawson knew it must be a fancy the sun seemed somehow\ncloser. To his left the coastline unfurled like a magic lantern show. On the\ncliffs, a flock of sheep turned and ran from the apparition in the sky in\nperfect unison. What would it be like to fly over people, over towns? Would the\npeople below scatter like sheep?\n\u201cI\nwonder, could go inland for a while? It might save us some time if we cut across\nthe foot of Cornwall.\u201d And I will be the first Englishman to fly over my\nnative soil like a god.\nAhuitzotl\nhesitated for a moment, then nodded and reached forward. \u201cOf course.\u201d Dawson\nfelt a something shift below him, and the Serpent started to turn in a\ngentle arc. Dawson felt himself sliding to the right, and braced himself on the\nsides of the craft, careful not to press the fragile surface too hard. He looked\naround, trying to locate the piercing hum at the edge of his hearing. The sound\nwas coming from the wires that held the wings in place. His heart-rate quickened\nfor a moment, but still there was no fear: he realised that he trusted the\nAztecan.\nThey\ncrossed the coastline and the view beneath them jumped into focus, becoming a\nbeguiling patchwork of brown and green and grey. He could see fields, where men\nhad enclosed the land in stone walls, and open spaces where it broke free into\nrolling moors and rocky outcrops. Dawson glimpsed movement and craned his neck\nback. Their shadow raced across the earth, their only link to the world below.\nThe\nland dropped away as they flew over a sheltered valley where a score of\nwhitewashed cottages clustered along a small river. Women sat outside the\ncottages, spinning yarn and gossiping: their upturned faces were pale smudges.\nThe \u2018Cloud Serpent\u2019 was over the settlement in moments, but on the far side\na gaggle of children spilled out of the buildings, racing up the side of the\nvalley to keep pace with the wonder in the sky. The children pointed and\nwhooped, though their shouts were faint murmurs from up here. Dawson turned in\nhis seat: just before he lost sight of the children he saw one boy stop and\nwave. He raised his arm to wave back, but the figure was gone, lost in the dip\nof the land.\nIf\nonly Alice could see this! If only she could share this with him, then the\nexperience would be complete. Then he would be complete. He still loved her. Now\nthat he had tasted wonder he could, finally, acknowledge that fact. He still\nloved her, despite the discrepancies of age and social class. But he would never\nsee her again. 'It would have been a boy...' she had written in her final\nletter.\nThe\nwind was making his eyes stream. No, not the wind.\nFor\na while he let tears blur the view. True, he might never get the chance to fly\nagain and should treasure every moment of the journey; but he might never get\nthe chance to cry like this, either.\nWhen\nhis eyes cleared he leaned forward and placed a hand gently on Ahuitzotl's\nshoulder. \u201cThank-you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have created something wonderful.\u201d\nFor\na moment he thought the Aztecan had not heard him over the wind. Then Ahuitzotl\nturned slightly and said, \u201cWhen Cozmatzin, my only child, was born, and his\nhoroscope was cast, the priests said this: 'He will die young, to chance, but\nfirst he will challenge the skies, and his handiwork will change the fate of\nnations'. Do you believe in the power of prophecy, Mr Dawson?\u201d\nUp\nhere it was possible to believe anything. \u201cI don't know. Perhaps.\u201d\n\u201cA\nfar better answer than you would have given on the ground!\u201d They were over\nhigh moorland now. Below, tiny islands of human influence, farms and abandoned\nmine workings, occasionally broke the pattern of the land. \u201cI do, though there\nare many things I once held as truth which I now reject. Prophecies made by our\npriests come true more than can be accounted for by mere chance. A month after\nhe finished work on the \u2018Cloud Serpent\u2019 Cozmatzin's name was drawn in the\nspring lottery. One week later he walked the path to the sun. He was twenty six.\nOnly children and youths die to usher in the spring. The next year his name\nwould not have gone forward. My wife also went to the sun, willingly, ten years\nago, as the Azteca always have in times of famine or crisis. I accepted her\ndeath. But Cozmatzin was not willing. He should not have had to die. He was so\nfull of life, of potential. I can no longer serve gods who demand that we accept\nsuch losses.\u201d Ahuitzotl turned back to his controls.\nDawson\nsaid nothing, because there was nothing to say. He was ashamed. In his\narrogance, he had not thought to ask the most important question: why Ahuitzotl\nhad risked his life, abandoned his country and his people, and thrown himself on\nthe mercy of his enemies.\nAhead,\nsunlight glinted on water. They had almost crossed the Cornish peninsular. A\ncart was pulled up on one side of a muddy track which ran off towards the coast.\nAs they approached, two men jumped from the cart. One pointed up at the flying\nmachine. Dawson raised his hand to wave, then stopped. The other man was\nhurriedly pulling a tarpaulin off the back of the cart, exposing something\nDawson recognized only too well from his years in the War Office.\n\u201cMy\nGod. Ahuitzotl, they\u2019ve got\u2014\u201c\n\u201cI\nsee it.\u201d The craft banked sharply to the right. Dawson had a last glimpse of\nthe man on the back of the cart bringing the gun to bear, then the whole craft\nshook as bullets tore into the flimsy fabric. A triad of holes appeared on the\nwing, just beyond Dawson\u2019s hand. The clatter of the gun was strangely distant,\ntoo far away to be causing the damage magically appearing around him.\nSomething\nsnapped below him and the \u2018Cloud Serpent\u2019 lurched violently. Dawson flailed\nfor a handhold. He felt splinters pierce his fingertips, but managed to get a\ngrip on the internal struts.\nAhuitzotl\nhad been thrown forward: he was calling out something in a language Dawson did\nnot recognize. It sounded like a curse, or maybe a prayer. He pushed himself\nback into his seat and grabbed for the controls. The craft twitched and veered\nfor a few seconds, then came round to fly straight again. Dawson could no longer\nhear gunfire. He started to settle back into a more comfortable position.\nThe\nengine cut out.\nThe\n\u2018Cloud Serpent\u2019 stalled as though snagged by a giant hand. The front end\ndipped sharply and Dawson\u2019s fingers tore into fabric as he scrabbled for\npurchase. He piled into Ahuitzotl\u2019s backrest. The view ahead, once full of\nsky, was now terrifyingly full of earth. The\nonly sound was the rush of the wind and the thrumming of the wires.\nAhuitzotl\nstarted pulling levers. The \u2018Cloud Serpent\u2019 shuddered and jumped, and their\ndescent slowed almost at once. They were no longer heading straight for the\nground. But they were still losing height rapidly.\nThe\nsea seemed an impossible goal. The would never reach the water before they came\ndown.\nDawson\nfound himself less concerned about the probability of dying than the certainty\nthat the flight would end. Such a short taste of freedom. He shimmied back and\npressed himself as far as he could into the body of the craft, pulling his legs\nto his chest and wrapping his arms around them. He should probably close his\neyes soon, before they hit.\nYet\ndespite the lack of power, the \u2018Cloud Serpent\u2019 flew remarkably well. Their\npath soon evened out into a shallow glide. They stood a good chance of reaching\nthe relative safety of the water before they crashed. He might even live through\nthis.\nDawson\nraised his head. \u201cAhuitzotl?\u201d\nThe\nAztecan did not reply, presumably still intent on the controls before him.\nDawson knew they did not have much time. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. This is my fault: if I\nhadn\u2019t asked you to fly inland they wouldn\u2019t have seen us.\u201d\nAhuitzotl\nshook his head, \u201cNo apology needed.\u201d His voice sounded strained above the\neerie whistling of the wind. \u201cIf the Pochteca had not stolen the gun from your\ngovernment, they would not have shot us with it. Do not curse fate. Wonder at\nit.\u201d\nThe\nfarmland below gave way to sand dunes. Dawson caught his breath: their grass\ncovered tops seemed close enough to touch.\nThen\nthey were over water.\nThe\nsea rushed up to meet them.\nAt\nthe last moment Ahuitzotl pulled the front of the craft up, and they\nbelly-flopped into the waves. As it hit there was a loud crack, and the craft\nslewed violently to the left. Dawson was thrown upwards: his head hit something,\nbut for some reason the pain was in his hand. Then he was flying again, no need\nof a machine to help him now.\nEverything\ncrashed down. He was under water, mouth and nose full of brine. He kicked out\nand his foot hit something solid. He kicked again. Sand. He realised he was\nstill clasping his legs, and forced himself to uncurl and stand up. The water\ncame up to his chest. His left hand hurt abominably, and he lifted it out of the\nwater to examine it. The back of his hand was a bloody mess.\nHe put it back in the water so he didn\u2019t have to look at it.\nHe\nlooked around. To his left, perhaps thirty yards away, was a beach. Ahead, the\n\u2018Cloud Serpent\u2019 rode the gentle swell. The pontoon had been torn from the\nshoreward wingtip and the craft was listing badly, but did not appear to be\nsinking.\nHe started to wade towards it, passing a tattered shape of black felt\nwhich might once have been a bowler hat. The only sound was the swoosh-sloosh of\nhis own progress. Coming up from behind it was difficult to see inside the\ncraft, and he called out Ahuitzotl\u2019s name. There was no answer.\nOnce\nhe was past the wing he could see the Aztecan slumped across the broken screen.\nHe called again and Ahuitzotl stirred and pulled himself upright. He shook his\nhead, then, ignoring Dawson, reached forward.\nDawson\ncame up to stand beside the craft. The \u2018Cloud Serpent\u2019 had tipped towards\nhim, and his head was level with the Aztecan\u2019s chest. Ahuitzotl pulled himself\nupright, then turned and offered a large map case of waxed leather over the edge\nof the craft.\n\u201cTake\nthis.\u201d There were dark stains on the leather.\n\u201cYou\u2019re\nhurt, sir.\u201d Dawson could smell the sickly fuel, and something else fainter,\nmetallic.\n\u201cYes.\nThat does not matter. These matter, now. The plans, for the \u2018Cloud Serpent\u2019.\nFor the others not yet built: all Cozmatzin\u2019s dreams. Please, take it.\u201d\nAhuitzotl closed his eyes as Dawson took the map case.\n\u201cLet\nme get help.\nA doctor\u2014\u201c.\nAhuitzotl\nwaved the suggestion away, then put his hand on the edge of the craft to steady\nhimself. \u201cI am not important. What is important is history: \u2019the fate of\nnations\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m\nsorry?\u201d\nAhuitzotl\nopened his eyes and looked down at Dawson. His gaze was still intense, but it\nseemed to be dimming, as though the light were leaking out from behind his eyes.\n\u201cYou have to hear this. The priests know. The Empire will fall. Europe is the\nnew power. Your sun is rising. But first you must suffer...the worst war in\nhistory. Power over the air...will win that war. Win it quickly. Save more\npointless deaths. That power is yours now. Use it well.\u201d\n\u201cI.\n. .of course. Now let me help you--\u201d\n\u201cNo.\nI have played my part.\u201d Ahuitzotl drew back his hand, leaving a red smear on\nthe vivid green of the bodywork. \u201cAll I ask is. . .a small favour...if you\nplease.\u201d\n\u201cAnything\nwithin my power.\u201d\n\u201cI\nhad matches. They...got damp. Do you have a light? Perhaps one of those, ah,\nexcellent petroleum lighters which work when wet?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\nyes I do,\u201d Dawson put the map case under his left arm and fumbled in his\njacket for his lighter. \u201cCan I ask what you intend to do?\u201d\n\u201cDamn\nmyself to the lowest circle of hell...if the priests are right. The Pochteca\nmust have seen us crash. If they get here and the plans are gone...they will\nhunt you down. Cane alcohol burns hot, fast. No traces-\u2014\u201c\n\u201cGood\ngod, you can\u2019t be serious.\u201d\n\u201cYou\nknow I am. Give me the lighter. Then go.\u201d\nDawson\nhanded the lighter to the Aztecan, then took a step back. \u201cSir. It has been an\nhonour.\u201d\n\u201cFor\nme also,\u201d Ahuitzotl's voice was a whisper. \u201cMay you ever travel with the\nEarth below you and the Sun above, and never walk in shadow.\u201d\nDawson turned and\nwaded ashore. Standing dripping on the sand, he took a last look at the\nmarvellous craft. Ahuitzotl stared back across the water at him for a moment,\nthen raised his hands.

Current discoveries in the physical sciences insist, however, that I reveal how these discoveries were previously made use of in a quarter remote from where they are being currently applied. That these discoveries are now being touted as brilliantly hopeful recalls to me the lesson Prometheus learned, that he who dabbles in mysterious secrets will bring forth misery as well as light.\nThose among you who followed my brother Raphael\u2019s career will now be pressing me for revelations: asking \u201cWhat secrets?\u201d But in order to bring out its truly tragic elements, I must begin with what was, for us, the beginning.\nRaphael and I were born a year apart from each other, and in childhood were the fondest playmates. Our infancy was spent in the sports of imagination: storytelling, fantasying and play-acting. But we began to diverge when we reached the age of ten or twelve, as boys and girls must. I, a budding woman, took on the devotional tradition my mother had willed me: the austere higher branches of the English church. I thus relinquished childish things and spent my spare time studying the classical languages that have fit me to study the Church fathers.\nAs a member of the luckier sex, meanwhile, my brother Raphael was entitled to transform the passions of his childhood into an adult vocation, and so practiced his painting. Everyone knows in skeletal detail the incidents surrounding my brother\u2019s rapid rise in the art world. He was impetuous and could endure no formal training, but he had a strong imaginative fancy and a gift for transcribing the loveliness of the female form.\nI had no appreciation for the productions of the beginning of his career. There is a taint of sensuality which adheres to the visual arts in many generations, and this corruption clung to the productions of my brother\u2019s early period. It was particularly emphatic in his choice of models, as Raphael brought to his studio pink and plump girls in tarty costumes that disclosed the sordid milieus in which he found them.\nBut then, as all know, his portraiture took a decided turn, and began to paint the more romantic, melancholic women for which he has become known. His turn towards the portrayal of spiritual subjects was likewise signaled in his character of the models he selected.\nI remember I was reading St. Augustine in the parlour adjacent to my brother\u2019s studio when Raphael\u2019s booming voice interrupted me, crying out \u201cAnna.\u201d The big, broad figure, wearing his one of his extravagant velvet robes, stood in the doorway. He thrust a girl towards me, stating \u201cI have found the most undeniable stunner, on the Vauxhall Road.\u201d She was tiny, no more than sixteen, with stringy hair and no breasts. Too scrawny to be a strong contender for the favors his usual models won, her soiled scarlet dress still proved she was a member of their profession. The girl gave me a toothy smile, trying to exude the sexual charm she thought would befit an artist\u2019s model.\n\u201cNo, not like that,\u201d exhorted Raphael. \u201cYou must look like you did on the street\u2014glum and distracted, as though focused on the life to come.\u201d\n\u201cBut I jes had a stone in me shoe.\u201d\n\u201cNo matter the reason,\u201d Raphael said impatiently. \u201cYou gave me mind of one bidding her lover off to the Crusades, sharing his holy mission while you grieved his inevitable death.\u201d\nHe commanded the woman, whose name was Agatha, to change out of her gaudy dress and put on a garment of tapestry he had found abandoned in the recesses of a Catholic cathedral. Then he took her into his studio and began to paint her as Guenevere, or Ophelia, or some other tragic literary woman who died for love.\nAnd so was inducted a new movement in our national art. The portraits he made of this waif in various states of distress and extremity sold well to his particular clientele of merchants and industrialists. Agatha, despite her personal insubstantiality, held an inexhaustible commercial value for Raphael. Her hauntingly large eyes and fragile bones were precisely right to convey the abstracted attitudes he devised.\nUnfortunately this girl, with her perennial troubles, was not the most reliable commodity. With two infants and a whole legions of siblings and parents she kept over in Mile\u2019s End, she would not adhere to the regular appointments Raphael tried to set. Sometimes she would come late, and sometimes not at all.\n\u201cI\u2019m sa sorry, Mr. Raphael,\u201d she would say, after having disappeared for several days from the picture of Joan of Arc he was making of her, \u201cMe sister in Cathcart lost her baby, and I had to attend to her bairns as well as me own.\u201d Nor would the notion of sending a message stick with her.\nRaphael, as a result was constantly in suspense. We all know he was a person of taut nerves, and I sometimes feared that while waiting for his model he was driving himself to the edge of madness. I would see him pacing for long hours back and forth across the studio before his half-completed canvas, in which Agatha\u2019s eyes were present but the mouth barely sketched, or the hair filled in but the face a blank shadow. At such times he would might run out and bring back some Millie or Susan, likewise emaciated and dark, but the sudden adjustment to a new model was always disruptive to his enterprise. The new model\u2019s features could not be made to match up with the strokes that had been inspired by his preferred one, and it took much covering up to produce a motley and corrupt portrait. No, Agatha was the gem in the rough, and Raphael\u2019s success, we agreed, depended on his excavation of her.\nBut one day when Raphael was feeling prostrated by the elusive Agatha he stormed out to take one of his rambling walks about town, and came home greatly excited.\n\u201cI have finally found a solution.\u201d Raphael told me. \u201cWalking through Haymarket, I came across a small shop fronted only by a dark curtain in the window, and a sign that gave the proprietor\u2019s name, Hans Broegler. It was, of course, a photographer\u2019s studio, and Hans Broegler, is an eminent pioneer of the new photographic art.\u201d\n\u201cI have read about this new wizardry,\u201d I replied.\nRaphael went on with his narration. \u201cWhen I saw his studio this moment the solution to all of my difficulties flashed in me. I would send my models to be photographed before I begin a new painting, and this way be provided with a lasting record of their physical attitude. In this way I will not be as subject to the models\u2019 wavering attention.\u201d\nHe sat down on a chair, immensely pleased with his idea, though I had to protest my brother\u2019s depersonalizing scheme. \u201cSurely this idea of yours will never work. Your portraits of Agatha, to capture her strange Romantic spirit, must ideally be made under the inspiration of her presence.\u201d\n\u201cI have conceived of the same argument, Anna, but I have defeated it. Surely the whole meaning of my art is that the spirit can be caught in the image, since the soul resides in the flesh. If the camera can capture the former, then why not the latter? Indeed, perhaps painting Agatha from photographs will allow me to concentrate more fully on depicting on her soul, since it will remove the distraction of her physical presence.\u201d\nHere Raphael knew he had partly won me, since I had always deplored the presence of women in Raphael\u2019s studio, as a threat to his morality. Nonetheless I doubted that a photograph\u2014a trick of light and paper that captured mere appearance\u2014could retain sufficient sense of an individual presence to recall it to the artist who worked with this quantity above all. For if a painter merely copied the appearance of flesh, then we had no need of painters, since photography could do so more accurately.\nI held my final judgment in abeyance, however, until I could judge the merit of the new works he practiced under this method. Several times over the next few months I watched Raphael take Agatha off to the studio, and come back with a large black sheet rolled up under his arm. These photographs he refused to show me, claiming it would upset my objectivity when later I was to look at his paintings for the first time. He likewise kept the studio barred to my entrance, crediting me as his harshest and most valuable critic whose opinion he would like all at once.\nFinally, after several months, I was invited to enter the studio. As I looked closely at the six or eight new paintings painted from photographs, I was surprised to see that my brother\u2019s spiritual emphasis had not faltered; on the contrary, it seemed to have intensified. The works were painted in the most somber tones. Their startling contrasts of shading seemed to draw my eyes down past surface details, into the nuances of gesture and expression.\n\u201cThe marks of shadows and light convey a rare depth,\u201d I said, \u201cIt is as though you have stripped away the surface and left behind the pure soul.\u201d\nRaphael smiled at me. \u201cI am glad you finally approve of my art.\u201d\n\u201cYes, you have managed to get utterly beyond your earlier fleshy preoccupations.\u201d\n\u201cI have been working hard on my method, though I must also give credit to Agatha. She has grown more subdued and pensive than when I met her\u2014influenced, perhaps, by the noble natures of the women whom she has had the opportunity to embody. For instance, as I did this sequence of St. Foy over the last few months, Agatha seemed to become more celestial as the work progressed.\u201d\n\u201cHer eyes seem more hollow and aloof.\u201d\n\u201cThese developments are, Anna, inspiring me to attempt an even more eminent subject. When Agatha comes today I am going to initiate a study of Mary, in tones evocative of purity and holiness. I plan to take her to the photography studio, to make a preliminary set of photographic sketches.\u201d\nBut Agatha did not come. For days and days, Raphael grew half deranged as he waited for his model. He was about to run to Picadilly to find some other waif who would sell her time, when I interrupted him.\n\u201cPerhaps I might try to do justice to our Holy Mother,\u201d I suggested. My brother had often made me pose when we were children, and I hated the tedium of it. But now I realized I had become envious of the simple woman being immortalized in these icons. My figure was tall and substantial rather than small and delicate, but my features, I thought, were equally inspiring of seriousness. And did I not genuinely aspire to an attitude of sanctity in my life?\n\u201cYou, Anna? But you despise modeling.\u201d\n\u201cFor any other project I would not offer. But I often have gazed on portraits of the Madonna, admiring the actual woman who had lent her own spiritual beauty to be recast in that hallowed form. Perhaps my own faith could inspire others, at the cost of only an hour in a photographer\u2019s studio.\u201d\nI thus found myself, on a warm day in June, at the designated address. My brother had entrusted me to go on my own, since the pose I was taking was straightforward. When I arrived at the storefront\u2014girded, as Raphael had told me, by black curtains\u2014I opened the door and set off a tinkle of bells in a minor key.\nAs I cautiously entered I found myself in a dark room flocked with yet more curtains of black drapery. Around the room were many black boxes on tables and tripods, great bulbs that would burn brightly standing on iron posts, as well as hundreds of strange lenses and tubes laid out in with seeming randomness on the shelves. There was also a door at the back of the studio that presumably connected with another room.\nAt last I spotted, in a recessed corner, the proprietor. Herr Bruegler wore a black suit and had a mass of white hair that stood up as though it had been electrified. Writing at a desk, he looked up towards me, \u201cAh, it is none other than Anna, whom I have been expecting.\u201d\n\u201cYes. Please tell me where I am to be seated to have my photograph taken. There are many objects in this room, but I see no chair.\u201d\n\u201cThe chair is in here, my dear\u2026in here,\u201d said the man, gripping my hand in his yellow wizened one, that resembled a plucked chicken leg. He guided me, to my surprise, towards an upright black box, tall enough to hold a person, which I had completely overlooked in my mental inventory of the room.\nOne I was inside the closet, and Herr Brogler had shut the curtain, it was completely dark. \u201cThere is a bench, which you will find if you bend your knees,\u201d said Herr Broegler, so I sat down. Not knowing at all what to expect, I waited for several minutes in the dark. Meanwhile I could hear a door opening and closing, sounds of papers rustling and glasses clanging. Finally there was a dull buzzing sound, and then a bright light came on for nearly a quarter of an hour, during this time Herr Broegler kept cautioning me to sit very still. Afterwards, the light went out and I sat even longer in the gloom.\nFinally I called out, \u201cHerr Broegler? May I come out now?\u201d\n\u201cOne brief minute, mine gutte Fraulein,\u201d he cautioned. \u201cNow, emerge!\u201d The studio, as I came out into it, was in the condition I had found it, empty of any apparatus that might have made the sounds I had witnessed.\nThe odd Herr Broegler was again courteous but brisk with me. \u201cI must now ask you to depart, Fraulein Anna, since the development of the photograph takes some hours. You will see it soon enough; it is my custom to send over the photographs by messenger.\u201d\nAs I exited the darkly curtained studio the June sun was all the more dazzling, an effect which prompted in me an unusually carefree mood. Because I stay in with my books so much of the time, I particularly relished my outing, and decided to proceed to a shop that stocked the sturdy boots I liked. I had arrived at Bond Street when I nearly tripped over a small person at the edge of the pavement.\nImagine my boundless sorrow and horror when I realized this small person was none other than our Agatha, resting herself on the curb with every indication of terminal exhaustion.\n\u201cMy dear!\u201d I cried. \u201cWhat are you doing on the road?\n\u201cI\u2019s sorry, Ma\u2019am. I do n\u2019t mean to be under foot. I was jes so awfully tired,\u201d she uttered with an expiring gasp.\n\u201cWhere is your home? I will have you taken there. You are so gravely ill.\u201d\n\u201cNo-ma\u2019am, you mus n\u2019t. Me mother is tendin\u2019 me bairns, an I\u2019 cannot hev her busy wi\u2019 me alik. I will die anyhow,\u201d Her voice was husky, and breathing seemed difficult to her.\n\u201cPerhaps there is still something to be done, that doctors can do. You must come with me; we can set you up where you will not have any worries to tax you.\u201d I hired a hansom and set us in it, fearing, as she coughed at every lurch, that she would not survive the bumpy ride. Nonetheless, I urged the driver to drive faster, as he navigated the crowded arteries of carts and pedestrians.\nFinally we arrived home, where I put her to bed while a pale and alarmed Raphael summoned our doctor.\n\u201cShe has an advanced tumor in her throat the size of an apricot,\u201d the kind young Dr. Billings said sorrowfully, after examining her. \u201cI fear she has not much time; it has been developing for several months.\u201d\n\u201cA tumor!\u201d I shuddered. \u201cIn such a young woman.\u201d\n\u201cIt is unusual,\u201d he said, \u201cbut not unheard of, in our city\u2019s poorer neighborhoods where provisions for health are so meager.\u201d\nThen we heard the bell again, and Raphael went himself down to see to it. He came back with a package, announcing \u201cIt is the photograph.\u201d\n\u201cWe should put it by, for the present,\u201d I suggested.\nBut Raphael insisted \u201cI must see that it is properly developed, before I pay Herr Broegler\u2019s man.\u201d He took the string off of the package, and I took an instant away from my vigil over Agatha to look on.\nI had not seen many photographs by that point, but these images of me looked queerer than I expected. They did not capture a mirror image. Rather, the process had issued a transformation. My eyes had hollows around them, and there were white streaks along my cheeks and nose. The effect was almost of a deaths-head lurking behind my familiar visage, which I found horribly unsettling as we stood in such close proximity to death itself. \u201cYou never told me that Herr Broegler\u2019s photographs were so ghastly.\u201d\nRaphael peered more closely, \u201cThey are, indeed, unusually morbid. Perhaps this quality wasn\u2019t as noticeable in Agatha\u2019s photograph, since she is bony to begin with.\u201d\nDr. Billings had been drawn over to our group by my exclamation. \u201cGoodness me!\u201d he said. \u201cIt gives the sense of vivisection. One almost thinks of the page of Gray\u2019s Anatomy where the face is pulled back to reveal the skull.\u201d\nRaphael then made his boldest speculation. \u201cPerhaps the penetrative effect of Herr Broegler\u2019s photography has been essential to my recent success, if allows me to look beneath the surface of our temporal flesh and depict the more permanent substructure.\u201d\nI looked back sternly. \u201cBe that as it may, Raphael. But if you must work with these photographs to produce your paintings, I insist that you promise never to let another living soul behold them. I won\u2019t look at myself as a corpse and insist that no one else does either.\u201d\nThen we turned back to Agatha, of whose truly desperate condition our dilemma inadvertently reminded us. Our patient lay sleeping, her face pale and with an anticipation of the coming peace upon it. Only once she stirred, fortunately at a moment after we had called in our deacon. She opened up her large, sad eyes, and gave a look redolent with humility and penitence. Then she whispered to us, \u201cPlease tell me mother, three Clove Lane,\u201d and closed those eyes to the little of this world\u2019s light that they had been allowed to behold.\nI was to have one further shock that afternoon, when I went to inform Agatha\u2019s mother of her daughter\u2019s passing. Not being familiar with the area around Clove Lane, I chartered a hansom to sit by until I should finish the unhappy business. The streets, as we entered, grew narrower and more squalid as I approached my destination. I saw so many women of Agatha\u2019s fragility and melancholy walking up the streets with burdens or babies that it was thrust upon me how ordinary a sight she must have presented in her own quarter, though her face be nationally worshipped.\nFinally I arrived at the named address, and made inquiries to a small, speechless boy of seven, who rushed into the house and pulling out an aged form of more protracted shrunkenness than Agatha\u2019s.\n\u201cYe know something of Agatha?\u201d she asked suspiciously.\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to tell you that she has passed away. She died in our house of her friends, in an atmosphere of comfort and Christian sanctity.\u201d\n\u201cFiddle!\u201d the woman shrieked. \u201cYe was \u2018er friends? Ye an\u2019 that fancy painter who kilt her? I allays rued \u2018er goin\u2019 in the streets but no bloke ever did as much harm.\u201d\nThe violence of the woman\u2019s accusation almost threw me off of her stoop. I appealed to her, \u201cMadam, you are mistaken; my brother did her no harm.\u201d\n\u201cShe was hale as Samson until \u2018e took \u2019er picsher. It\u2019s a dastardly murder and it\u2019ll foller \u2018im to the grave\u2014an yers, if ye shared in it.\u201d\nI was appalled by the woman\u2019s curse, and concluded that she had been influenced by the suspicions that attend photography, like all attend new technologies. The pitiable condition of these poorer classes leaves them with so little control over the fates of their lives and bodies, that they develop misplaced superstitions. It\u2019s easier to blame the devil or unfamiliar innovations for illness than the simple, but pernicious, agencies of poor hygiene and nutrition.\nI tried to continue the interview. \u201cAre there any arrangements you would have us make for her daughter? We will arrange the costs.\u201d But she croaked, \u201cYe keep her bedeviled body,\u201d and slammed the door upon me.\nThis conversation disturbed me, particularly in view of the morbidity that had unexpectedly permeated the day. It was even harder upon Raphael, when I reported it. After hearing the narrative in its entirety he repeated to himself several times in an undertone, \u201cShe believes I stole her daughter\u2019s spirit; she cursed me.\u201d He was unwilling to let the idea go, and it was not the first time that I observed there was something weak in his sensibility that responded to superstitious proposals.\nWe gave Agatha a dignified funeral. For the next few weeks I saw that the household was swathed in mourning, moreover, since even though Agatha had had respite within it for only a few hours, she had been a frequent and important guest beforehand. The walls of Raphael\u2019s studio, hung with her image in so many heavenly attitudes, seemed under these conditions like a shrine; I believe Raphael and I during this period shared an unequalled sense of being looked down upon from a higher realm.\nIn a few weeks a normal pattern of life resumed. Agatha\u2019s influenced was in abeyance, since Raphael was now using my own image for his rendering of the Madonna. However unusual my photograph had first seemed, Raphael claimed he had come to find it no less inspiring than Agatha\u2019s, though differently so.\n\u201cYour visage is solemn in its sternness, though the solemnity also calls upon devotion and reverence. It reminds one of another message from the world beyond, by suggesting that time is fleeting, and that one must be, in every instant, attentive.\u201d\nThis was the one time in my life in which I took pleasure in my appearance. For this reason, I took it as a direct chastisement to my vanity when a large and horny blister began to develop on my left cheek. This blister was painful in the sight of the sun\u2014so much so that, even though it was a beautiful autumn, I stayed even more within doors. Eventually, I even called upon Dr. Billings.\n\u201cIt is a cancer, Anna, and I you must authorize me to take it off immediately, since it will inevitably penetrate more deeply.\u201d\nOf course I did, and it left a gaping blemish that had to be bandaged for months and was never to dissolve. Nor was this the end of it. After the first blemish had been excised, I spotted the development of a similar one on the other side of my face. Dr. Billings caught it earlier, but removing it nonetheless caused a parallel scar, with the result that I now had no undisfigured profile.\nThe blighting of my face was unfortunate for me. I had always been shy, and it secured me as a recluse. Previously I would sometimes go out to a reading or a service, but afterwards I never had the courage. It is too horrible to me to present oneself to the world in such a way as to attract attention, and worse yet, pity.\nMy company came, from this time forward, to be reduced to Raphael, who was, in the years to suffer a grave decline. His painting of myself as the Madonna had some merit, but did not attract the popularity of his best work with Agatha. Raphael thereupon found he had lost his grip on the cultural imagination; he became baffled at his inability to stimulate his clientele, and bitter at the fickleness of fame. Poor and desolate, he slipped more and more fully into the shades of opium, until the day came that he did not return\nPersonally, however, I have always linked my brother\u2019s artistic decline to Agatha\u2019s mother\u2019s curse. It fed, I have believed, a fancied sense of damnation that had always been latent, and which grew to overwhelm him in the years to come. For Raphael\u2019s whole remaining lifetime I fought fruitlessly to dissolve the pressure of this superstition, believing his acceptance of it lay in a deficiency of Christian faith. But the sense of guilt permeated his artistic vocation, which could not give up, since it contained all that was redeeming and good to him; but which he could have no peace in, either.\nI was therefore, the one who remained to chastised, by the new scientific facts that were recently presented to me. It happened that Dr. Billings dropped in to my home a few months ago. Once young, he is now, like myself, withered and aged, though a senior member of his profession and a member of the Royal Society of Physicians.\n\u201cAnna,\u201d he said, as he came to visit me in my parlour. \u201cThis morning, I experienced something like a revisitation of the past.\u201d\nOnce he was seated across from me he began again, trembling somewhat. \u201cThis morning I attended a meeting of the Royal Society, of which you know I have long been a member. There I saw some of the first known results in England of a new image-producing technology.\u201d\n\u201cThis technology produces something called the Roentgen ray. It is created as one passes a current through a vacuum tube. It is invisible, and yet operates, mysteriously, as light.\u2019\n\u201cIt has, moreover, however, one extraordinary feature: it passes through substances that are softer and casting a shadow in front of those that are hard. The German scientists who have discovered it are searching for ways to use it in orthopedic medicine because of the photographs of the body it can help to produce, in which the flesh and organs are dimly indicated, and the bones and teeth emerge in high relief.\u201d\nDr. Billings went on, \u201cWhen I saw these first Roentgen-ray photographs, I was reminded of the peculiar photograph of you that Raphael possessed. It seems quite likely that it was partially produced by a preliminary form of the Roentgen-ray.\u201d\nI asked the doctor: \u201cHow could Herr Broegler have controlled this new technology twenty years ago?\"\n\u201cRoentgen\u2019s discovery of this mysterious ray\u2014which he has himself called the X-Ray--was entirely accidental, and many claims have been emerging to suggest that there have been previous accidents of the kind,\u201d Dr. Billings explained. \u201cAll of the components and techniques that produced it have been around for many decades. Perhaps your Herr Broegler brought over this technology in its precocious state from some laboratory in his native land.\u201d\nI thought back many years to my experience of Herr Broegler\u2019s odd closet. \u201cThe need to ignite a current would have explained why I heard an odd buzzing sound before the light went on. How ingenious the man was! He rendered an X-ray image on the same paper as a standard photographic image, so that the final image was not merely a portrait of bones against a black background, but seemed to give a glimpse of the skeletal substructure beneath the flesh itself.\u201d\n\u201cThere is one thing I have not mentioned. The scientists who have carefully tested this ray know that they must place strict precautions and filtrations around its use, since the ray is highly dangerous in its unadulturated form.\n\u201cHe did not then, know of these precautions at that time,\u201d I said grievously, finally understanding the old crone\u2019s riddle that linked Agatha\u2019s death with my disfigurement.\nLast week, I covered up my face with a scarf and went for a rare outing. I sought that studio again, to confront the proprietor or his heir for the misery he produced. But when I arrived the studio was found to be gone, and replaced with a tobacconist\u2019s. I made inquiries in the neighborhood, and no one remained from the old period to recall the man and his strange, dark studio.\nCats slipped in and out of the alleys like shadows. A small boy stared at my swathed head, and darted off. As I walked along back, I pondered the future of our nation\u2019s science, and of its art.\nDid my brother suspect that Agatha\u2019s spiritual quality was her cancer? Did England guess that the signs of soul in my brother\u2019s paintings were merely deeper layers of flesh? What can lie ahead for our people who can so gravely confuse these entities? I cannot guess, though curtained in my own black scarf I too have been one of the sufferers of the flesh, and walked among the legion of the Unclean Spirit.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050906051005\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/octdec2000\/mysteries.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"Suzy Waldman, a doctoral student in Victorian Literature in Halifax, Novia Scotia, sent us a wonderful outr\u00e9 story last month.

There are\nunimaginable glories that await our species, but the larger issue of a dire\npredicament, coming almost seven decades from now, looms over any optimism.\nMy name is Tyler Doff.\nEarly in 1895, I worked at City Life and Causality, located in the\ntowering, gray building in the downtown of the city I lived in.\nThe insurance industry, even if one works in a minor position, like\nwhat I had, gives one mature, albeit fatalistic views.\nIt is these views that led to my fantastic, complex endeavors.\nMy small apartment overlooked a\ngaudy portion of the city. The\ntaverns and houses of prostitution were open for business around the clock.\nActivity was particularly vigorous at night.\nEven from my window, I could glimpse many forms of loathsome\ndebauchery. People, I felt, were at perpetual war with their better,\nhigher natures. The red heat of\nhell, I felt sure, would blow on many of the men I saw from my window, after\nthey all had their interval on this earth.\nI wrote of war, in the passage\nabove. This was a time when war\nwas much on my mind. Remember,\nthis was the time of the Cuban revolt against the Spanish authority on that\nisland, a foreign land so near to the shores of our Republic. President Cleveland urged citizens not to support the rebels,\nbut many of us were letting Mr. Hearst and Mr. Pulitzer do our thinking for\nus, trapping our thoughts in black ink.\nAt that moment, 1895, war seemed\nto be in the very air, its spirit woven into golden rays of the sun, and the\nglint of the night's stars and moon. A man named Stephen Crane, only twenty-three years old,\npublished a novel about our civil war, and every literate person could smell\nthe spilled blood and viscera on the pages, such was the dark magic of Mr.\nCrane's words.\nSo near the turn of the next\ncentury, I despaired for humanity's future.\nThe Lord had granted me, simple\nTyler Doff, a transcendental understanding of all scientific principles, but\nhad either cursed or blessed me with no public ambition.\nWalking the daily, working world, I appeared a normal creature of\nflesh, but also only a pale shadow. I\nwas the type of man who would seem to disappear even as I stayed clearly in\nsight.\nAs appropriate to these qualities\nof mind and soul, I constructed a machine.\nI used it to travel into the next\ncentury, as easily as one could use a horse to visit a neighboring town, then\nreturn.\nEven\nbefore I began my incredible passage, I had already grasped that the future is\nnot a hard, fixed object. My\nexperiences bore this out.\nMy machine and I made it to 1962.\nThat year, a Roman Catholic will\nbe the American President. (Have\nfaith in this, for much of what follows is still fluid.)\nThe President will be a man with small eyes that still manage to\nproject a kind of inner warmth. He will smile easily and often, and his voice will crackle\nwith all the rhythms of his New England origins, despite his wealthy, family\nbackground. Bigotry had been the\ncause of much of my despondency, second only to the scourge of war.\nI was therefore happy to see one of the Catholics leading our Republic.\nCuba at that time will be a\ntyrant's land, and the puppet of a far greater reign of tyranny that will\narise in Russia, replacing the Czarist monarchy. The Russians will be ruled by a series of bosses, the system\nitself being the villain enslaving the Russian people.\nIn contrast, Cuba's maximum leader will, for decades, be the same man,\na rogue with a Biblical prophet's beard, but a gangster's eyes.\nThe Russian tyrants will have\nmilitary designs regarding our Republic, and place unbelievably destructive\nweapons in its puppet state, Cuba, toward that purpose.\nThen the Catholic President will\navert the threat, through the skillful use of a blockade.\nThis will force the removal of the weapons which I have no choice but\nto call apocalyptic, for that will be the awesome scope of their potential\nforce.\nHowever,\nI wrote above of future events being fluid.\nThere is another possibility for\n1962, and I have traveled to that one as well.\nIn\nboth versions of 1962, the Catholic President will have a pronounced weakness\nfor the pleasures of the flesh. Furthermore,\nthe scope of this flaw will not be known for decades, if things turn out\nright.\nFor\nin the second version of 1962, the Catholic loses the election of 1960,\nbecause his private sins become public knowledge in the weeks before Election\nDay. (In the first version of\n1962, this information doesn't circulate widely until later in the century.)\nThe Catholic's opponent, a very\ndifferent sort of man, wins the Presidency.\nIn this second possibility, the opponent must still grapple with the\ngreat emergency of 1962, just as the Catholic did.\nThe opponent, even in his youth,\nwill have a face that seems possessed of great jowls, heredity and chance\nbeing the capricious creatures they are. His nose will be prominent, and sharp, as sharp as his\nintellect and political instincts.\nThe opponent proves as resolute\nas the Catholic, but his assertiveness is not a soldier's tenacity, but the\nflailing of an angry, anxious man. International affairs of state, the risky art of\nbrinkmanship, are personal for the opponent.\nThey will be too personal.\nIn\nthe version of the future in which the opponent wins in 1960, when the crisis\nof 1962 comes, he orders our armed forces to execute a full-out military\nassault of Cuba and Russia.\nThen the normal course of war\nunfolds. With the new, future\nbreed of absolute, destructive weapons, all battles end.\nHowever, then the battlefields disappear into light and heat, as do any\nwho might then have come to mourn, and remember the deceased, for they will\nalready have joined the company of the dead.\nIn a struggle to be fair, I wish\nI could, at least, credit this action to the impulsiveness of youth.\nHowever, both the Catholic and the opponent will only be in their\nforties. Furthermore, the\nopponent will be four years older than the Catholic.\nIn this second version of 1962, I\nbarely escaped back to 1895 with my life, the violence of this new breed of\nweapons Herculean in its scope, closing its death grip on the whole globe.\nHumanity is removed from the\nworld stage. There are no further\ngenerations to succeed Tyler Doff, or anybody else.\nOr\nthus it is, in the second possibility for 1962.\nSafe back in 1895, I still, many\nnights, home from my work at City Life and Causality, look out my apartment\nwindow, and see the comings and goings at the taverns and the brothels.\nI am still repulsed but, now, I do not judge.\nWill\nthey?","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050903212707\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/janmar2001\/narrative.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The Internet's Premier Magazine of Historical Science Fiction","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/3PyhWzt2MXnzvx4Xpp5lD-QrhYk.json","volume":2.0,"issues":1.0,"has_text":true}

Despite its size, the train station was nearly\nempty this morning. Kansas City was a major commercial hub\non the new transcontinental railroad line, but this tiny station\nwas a mere water-stop to replenish the steam engines so they\ncould proceed on their way west. There was little passenger\ntraffic on this Wednesday morning and Jordan began to worry\nthat no one would be here to pick him up. Taking the handle\nof his heavy leather suitcase, he headed for the road, hoping\nhis father would be there.\nThis is going to be a hard trip, he thought. Circumstances\nhad compelled Jordan to take an unplanned vacation from his\nteaching position at a renowned University in Boston. Hed\nreceived telegrams saying his fathers condition had\nworsened. Jordan wondered if his father would even remember\nto come pick him up. Maybe I should have arranged for a ride\nand not bothered him, he thought in hindsight.\nJordan stepped out around the corner of the tiny station.\nThe ticket office was closed and no one was around, either\nin the offices or on the platform. There werent even\nany horses tied to the hitching posts in front of the railroad\noffice. Looking down the dusty road, he saw no traffic.\nThe\nonly thing in sight was a broken down cargo wagon parked a\nfew hundred feet down the road. It was empty except for an\nold man who seemed to be asleep at the reins. That cant\nbe him, thought Jordan. Hes much too old to be Dad.\nHe approached the wagon cautiously and his eyebrows rose in\nsurprise. Sure enough, it was his father.\nJordan approached, careful not to spook the horses. He hoped\nto catch his fathers eyes, but the old man just sat\non the buckboard staring blankly ahead of him. Waiting for\nsome sign of recognition, Jordan stood next to the old weathered\nwagon. His father, Warren, however, didnt notice him.\nHe simply continued to gaze off into the distance, his mind\na thousand miles away.\nSighing, Jordan noted that the wagon was on its last legs.\nThe wheels were warped and the wood so riddled with dry rot\nthat it was a miracle it could stay together. The very rivets\nand screws that held the wagon together seemed ready to fall\noff onto the ground. Like the wagon, his father had aged tremendously,\nsince hed last seen him. His dark hair was now almost\ncompletely white and the once husky man was now thin and frail.\nThe lines in his fathers face had deepened, giving the\nold man an almost mummified appearance. Dark circles were\ncarved into his face, as if hed never overcome the grief\nof his wifes death.\nIts been three years, Jordan thought. He should be handling\nit better by now. Nonetheless, Warren Haskell seemed to be\nwasting away, unable to cope without his companion of more\nthan thirty-five years.\nJordan rapped the side of the buckboard with his knuckled\nand stepped up onto the wheel to climb up onto the seat next\nto his father. His father blinked and glanced at him. Seeing\nhis son, he smiled feebly and straightened his back slightly.\nHi,\nson, the old man said. Have a good trip?\nSmiling, Jordan lifted his bag and set them into the bed of\nthe wagon and replied, It was all right. Have you been\nwaiting long?\nNo,\nnot really. I was just sitting here, thinking, said\nthe father.\nThinking about mother, you mean, thought Jordan, finishing\nhis fathers sentence. Without further comment, the old\nman shook the reins and clicked loudly to urge the two old\nhorses into motion. With a jerk and a few unglamorous rattles,\nthey headed away from the station toward the main road that\nled to the family farm. It was a good two-hour ride to the\nold place. Jordan hoped it would give him some time to talk\nto the old man to find out if things were as bad as his neighbors\nhad reported in their telegrams. He didnt want to face\nthe fact that the old man might be going senile. Putting him\nin a hospital or somewhere he would be taken care of would\ndestroy the old mans pride and that was the only thing\nhe seemed to have left.\nThe first hour of the trip passed without conversation. Jordan\nsilently endured the bumps and jars of the uneven dirty road\nand studied his father, waiting for him to talk. All signs\nof civilization were long out of sight before Warren finally\nspoke.\nLook\nat that, he said. See it?\nJordan glanced ahead where his father pointed. The old road\nstretched far ahead of them across the flat featureless landscape.\nThe air shimmered from the July heat even this early in the\nmorning, but nothing struck Jordans eye. What?\nhe asked. I dont see anything.\nThere\non the road, insisted his father. Dont you\nsee it?\nSquinting, Jordan examined the road. There was nothing. No\nsigns, no oncoming traffic, no objects on the dry dusty grade,\njust the shimmering reflection of heat on the road far ahead\nof them. What are you talking about?\nThe\nwater on the road, see?\nBlinking, Jordon saw the shining reflection at the edge of\nthe roadway far in front of them. You mean the mirage?\nsaid Jordan. Its just a reflection from the heat.\nYou know its not really water.\nHmph,\nsaid the older Haskell. How can you be so sure?\nJordan blinked in surprise. Dad, you know its\njust an illusion. See, as we get closer, the mirage fades\nand the road is dry. Its just a reflection of light\nfrom the heat on the road.\nI\nknow, I know. Thats what everyone says. Heck, thats\nwhat I told you when you were just a boy. But lately\nlately\nIve been wondering. Whats if its not a reflection?\nWhat if we really are seeing water?\nSuddenly bothered, Jordan thought, Has he lost his mind? How\ncould it be water, Dad? Its dry as a bone out here.\nIndeed, the early summer bore every indication of the start\nof a drought. Much of the green that normally adorned this\nstretch of road was a dull, dusty brown.\nYoure\nthe scholar, said Warren. Isnt it true that\nonce, thousands of years ago, all these flat plains were underwater?\nWhat if were seeing the water that used to be here,\nbefore it all died up?\nMy God, thought Jordan. Hes serious.\nThink\nabout it, his father said. What if mirages are\nripples in time that open windows to scenes as things were\nyears ago?\nJordan\nwas speechless. He didnt want to give credence to the\nidea by arguing against it. Perhaps his father was just kidding.\nWhat\ngave me the idea was an old article I read. It was in one\nof those old travel magazines you used to love reading as\na kid. It told a story about a mirage in Italy years ago,\nback in the 1850s. Remember?\nJordan shook his head mutely.\nThe\narticle told about all sorts of mirages, all over the world.\nYou know mirages occur at sea too, didnt you?\nWarren seemed animated now. What he was saying excited him.\nAnyway, in Italy, at the southern tip of Sicily, there\nwas a mirage that occurred every so often. They say that,\non rare evenings, when atmospheric conditions were just right,\nyou could see a city in the distance way out at sea. A tall\nmajestic city with tall shiny spires of crystal and white\nstone that floated at the edge of the horizon. They called\nit La Citta Signatore, the city of Dreams. Over the years,\nit became quite famous, but its appearance was as rare and\ninfrequent, so few people really believed it.\nThen\nin 1869, it appeared every day for a week. As the word spread,\nmore and more people came to see it. Crowds gathered along\nthe beaches each night at sunset to glimpse the illusionary\nmetropolis. They say the view of the city usually only lingered\nfor a few minutes, but on the final night that week the vision\nlasted nearly an hour. Thousands of people came to the shore.\nSome photographers showed up with their equipment and apparently\neven took pictures of it. Then it disappeared.\nThe\nold man sighed and shook his head sadly. Its never\nappeared since.\nAt\nthe time, experts said the city was an illusion caused by\nrare atmospheric thermal inversions, which caused images of\nlight to skip and appear hundreds of miles away. They said\nthe mirage was a city far over the horizon, but the witnesses\nsay no city in Europe ever had a skyline like that.\nWarren\nlooked over and smiled at his son. What gave me the\nidea about mirages being real was another article I found\nin the Kansas City Gazette about a year ago. It had a report\nabout some ruins that were found in the Mediterranean just\nsouth of Sicily. Far off the coast, deep underwater, archeologists\ndiscovered giant columns of stone, ruins of an ancient city\nthat earthquakes sank beneath the sea long ago. The columns\nwere of white stone and some had inlays of crystal that would\nhave gleamed like glass in the sun.\nI\nthink what they found was La Citta Signatore, he said\nemphatically.\nDad,\nsaid Jordan, the first article was just a story, the\nsecond a coincidence. There are thousands of ruin sites all\nover the Mediterranean. It doesnt mean the mirage was\nlooking at them back through time.\nDoesnt\nit? asked Warren. Did I mention that the ruins\nwere found just off the coast from where La Citta Signatore\nwas seen? And have you ever heard of any other Mediterranean\ncity that had crystal inlays in tall columns of white stone?\nJordans\neyes grew wide. Maybe he is senile, he thought. He cant\ndistinguish reality from fantasy anymore.\nWarren\nnoticed the shocked look on Jordans face and smiled\nsoftly. It was just an idle notion, son. Dont\nlook so worried. Then he turned his attention back to\nthe road and added, Still, dont you think the\nideas fascinating? Doesnt it excite you to think\nit could be true?\nJordan\nrelaxed a little. Well, if youre not serious,\nyes. Its an unusual idea. But if it were true, wed\nbe seeing back in time a lot and wed see more than just\ncities and water. If it were true, then why dont mirages\nshow other things?\nHmph,\ngrunted Warren again. Whos to say we dont?\nIf a mirage appeared out in the desert and opened to just\na few years ago, then all youd see would be desert on\ntop of desert. No one would notice it. The sames true\nwith windows that open out at sea or most anywhere else. Wed\nonly notice these windows when whats revealed is really\ndifferent than the present, wouldnt we?\nJordan\ngrimaced with worry once again. I suppose, he\nmuttered, not wanting to encourage the conversation further,\nbut his father continued.\nThe\nway I figure it, the larger the area, the further back the\nvisions would appear. A huge desert might have mirages that\ngo back tens of thousands of years. Small spots might only\ngo back a few months or years.\nThink\nabout it, said Warren. Havent you heard\nstories of people in the desert seeing mirages with more than\njust water? People have reported seeing oases with trees and\nbirds in the water, where there was nothing but sand.\nBut\nthose people were hallucinating, insisted Jordan. They\njust saw what they wanted to see.\nWarren\nnodded his head and smiled wryly. Maybe. Maybe thats\ntrue. Then he paused and added, Then again, maybe\nthey werent imagining anything at all.\nJust\nthen, they turned off the main road and the wagon bounced\nand creaked noisily on the rough untended road that led to\ntheir farm. Jordan had a lot of pleasant childhood memories\nof the old place. In his youth, it had been a real working\nfarm. The crops it produced had made a decent living and paid\nfor his first few years at college. After hed grown\nand moved away, his folks had continued to work the fields\nwith the help of hired hands, that is, until mother had died.\nSince then, his father had let the workers go and left the\nfields lying fallow. Because the farms loans were all\npaid off, his dad didnt have to work, but it seemed\njust such a waste to let the farm go unused.\nAs\nthey rounded a stand of tall dead trees, Jordan looked out\nat the family homestead and he gazed in shock at the sight.\nInstead of the green fields and meadows he remembered, all\nthat lay before him was dead wasteland. Not only had the grass\nin the fields died, it looked as if it had been stripped away\nleaving nothing but barren earth.\nMy\nGod, said Jordan. Whats happened to the\nplace? The wagon kicked up dust from the unpaved road\nand clouds powdery dry earth billowed up around him obscuring\nthe view and disrupting his questions as he started to cough.\nWarren\ndidnt seem to notice, he smiled broadly as he urged\nthe horses into a faster trot in an effort to outrun the dust.\nI know it doesnt look pretty, but I want to show\nyou something, he said.\nChoking,\nJordan gasped, Show me? Show me what? Everythings\ngone! Indeed, the farm was dead. The grass along the\nfence lines was parched and dry. Where lush green crops had\nonce grown, now only dust blew. Even the meadow of wild flowers\nthat Dad had left untilled behind the house was nothing more\nthan hard, bare dirt.\nWhat\nhave you done, Dad? Jordan said a lump growing in his\nthroat. Why did you let it all go? Was there a drought?\nIs there a problem with irrigation water?\nWarren\npulled the horses to an abrupt stop in front of the small\nfarmhouse. The horses stomped noisily in gravel and more dust\nbillowed up around them as he clamored out of the wagon. Oh,\nno, said Warren. It took a lot of work to get\nthe place this way. Before I laid off the hired help go, I\nhad them build a small earth dam back up near the property\nline and divert the creek toward the old Colson ranch. Then\nI blocked up the remaining irrigation ditches. But even after\nthe water was gone, the grass in the fields still wouldnt\ndie. I had to go out and buy a couple hundred dollars of salt\nto kill everything off, so the hardiest weeds would die. I\npoisoned the soil, so nothing could grow back.\nJordan\ncouldnt believe his ears, but his father spoke nonchalantly\nas though it was perfectly reasonable. As Jordan sat dumfounded\nin the buckboard, his father unhitched the horses and shooed\nthem away. They hurried over to the horse trough to drink.\nIt was the only evidence of water anywhere in sight.\nAs\nhis father ambled toward the hose, Jordan grabbed his luggage\nfrom the bed of the wagon and hurried to follow him. But\nwhy, Dad? he said. Why?\nWarren\nstopped at the front door and looked back with deep sadness\nin his eyes. Why, I did it for your mother, he\nsaid. Then he managed a feeble smile and turned to walk inside.\nJordan\nfollowed slowly, pausing once more to survey the devastation.\nEverything he remembered was gone. The barn was empty and\nlivestock long since sold off. Even the trees along the old\ncreek bed were dead and leafless. No hint of life was anywhere\nin sight.\nStorming into the house, Jordan was ready to tie into the\nold man, but found Warren sitting quietly at the kitchen table,\nstaring out the window at the barren, lifeless fields. Jordans\nanger faded to pity as he him. He seemed nearly as wasted\nas the land outside. After a moment, Jordan reflected, Maybe\nwith Mom dead, he wants to die, too. Maybe he cant stand\nthe thought of anything living with her gone.\nAt length, his anger ebbed. He turned slowly and took his\nsuitcase back into his old room at the other end of the house.\nExcept for the dust, it was almost exactly as hed left\nit more than ten years before. His mother had always left\nthe spare room ready in case he ever wanted to come home and\nvisit. But with his graduate studies and his new job at the\nuniversity, hed never returned, except for her funeral,\nthat is. For a moment Jordan was lost in memories of life\nhere on the farm. Hed always been anxious to leave and\nhad loved the excitement of college in the city, but hed\nalways cherished his memories of home.\nShaking himself, he realized these were the same memories\nthat trapped his father. He quickly put his clothes away and\nwent in to confront his father, once more. As he hurried into\nthe kitchen, anger welled up again. How could you do\nthis, Dad? Youve destroyed everything.\nWarren simply gazed out the window and smiled. For a moment,\nJordan thought he was being ignored. Then, without moving\nhis gaze from the window, Warren said, I told you. I\ndid it for your Mother.\nMother?\nshouted Jordan. How can you say that? She loved this\nplace. Even when the farm barely paid for itself, she said\nshe couldnt bear to leave it because her whole life\nwas here. She always claimed the city, despite its crowds\nof people, was too lifeless. If she werent already dead,\nwhat youve done here would kill her.\nJordans face was flushed with rage. He started to chastise\nhis father more, but saw a tiny tear weaving its way down\nthe old mans face. Again, his anger was washed away\nby a wave of pity. He doesnt understand, Jordan thought.\nHes lost his mind.\nKneeling down beside his father, Jordan held his arm. Dad?\nCan you hear me? His father continued to stare mutely\nout the window. Dad, you need help. Ill get a\nplace for you to stay near where I work. Everything will be\nokay.\nWarren frowned and grew serious. No, he said softly.\nJordans hands tightened briefly on his fathers\narm.\nI\nwont leave. This is where your mother is, the\nold man said.\nStaring with horror, Jordan thought, Hes crazy. Hes\ncompletely insane. Trying one last time, Jordan said, Dad,\nMoms dead. The farm is gone. Theres nothing left\nfor you here. Everything Mom would have loved about this place\nhas died. I just dont want you to die here, too.\nI\ndont know why you cant see it, he said.\nAll youve done is turn this place from a thriving\nfarm into a desert. Glancing out the window, he asked,\nHow can you even bear to look at this\nthis\nThen his jaw dropped open and he stopped talking, for outside\nthe window, the air across the dead flat ground outside shimmered\nin the noon July sun. The hot parched earth outside radiated\nheat like a furnace and image through the window flickered.\nAs\nhe watched, for an instant, just a fleeting instant, the lifeless\ndirt vanished and Jordan looked out across the green meadow\nof grass his mother had so loved. Jordan watched motionless,\nas a tall young woman walked across the meadow with her arms\noutstretched to touch the top of all the wildflowers she passed.\nHe recognized the housedress she always wore and saw her head\ntilt back with joy in the cool morning air. He could almost\nhear her singing the way she always did when she walked through\nher field of flowers.\nThen\nthe image faded, as a hot breeze dispelled the scene. Once\nmore, all he could see was dry, dead dirt, and the wavering\ndistortions of heat rising from the ground.\nTurning in shock, Jordan stared at his father. The old man\nsmiled, but tears ran down his face.\nSee?\nsaid his father. Thats what I wanted to show you.\nHe smiled gently at his son. Do you understand why I\ndid it now? Do you know what I meant when I said I did it\nfor your mother?\nJordan was speechless. But\nbut\nWarren patted his son on the arm. Tell you what, son.\nPull up a chair and get that pitcher of lemonade thats\nin the ice-box. We can talk while we watch. Then he\nfaced back toward the kitchen window and waited.\nAfter a long while, Jordan stood, got two glasses from the\ncupboard and the half-filler pitcher of lemonade from the\nrefrigerator. The ice had melted and the juice was lukewarm.\nNevertheless, Jordan moved a chair next to his fathers.\nIn\nsilence, they watched and waited for the midday heat to summon\nanother mirage.\nBack\nto top","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20041128094100\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/aprjun2002\/ripple.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/0KpaslBFw4cCKak8xhqE-CYL-ro.json","volume":3.0,"issues":1.0,"has_text":true}

Denise observed from behind the gallows, marveling at the senselessness of death. There was no use for her to feel pity for these people; she was here to perform her duty. One more head was all Denise needed.\nThe townspeople packed themselves tightly together, moving toward the gallows, desiring a closer view of their doomed monarch. The guards exited the prison and marched the sobbing, begging woman past Denise and up the gallows steps.\nDenise didn\u2019t dare shake her head in sympathy, or the throng of people would be upon her like rabid dogs and her pretension was to remain hidden. Her own head joining the others accumulating in the basket would cause the mission to be aborted.\nThe crying monarch was forced to kneel, her neck placed in the notch and fastened. Hair hung in her face, tears dripped upon the wooden planks. The richly embroidered clothes she favored had been replaced with a drab gray dress, her velvet-slippered feet now bare and dirty.\n\"Kill her!\" an old beggar woman screamed in the crowd.\nOthers echoed her words, the angry blood lust drifting upon the street\u2019s rancid air.\nThe prison warden read the woman\u2019s sentencing and the death-hungry mass cheered. The drum roll began, the blade whooshed down, and the queen\u2019s head parted from her rigid body with a wet noise. It tumbled into a bloody, gore-splattered basket. Two men lifted the corpse and carried it down to a wagon full of pateless bodies.\nYelling joyously, the crowd milled around, discussing the fact that justice had been served. Denise observed them quietly as she waited for a servant to bring her the basket. Finally, Denise made her way into the prison with the heavy, gruesome load. She set it outside a closed door where someone would skewer the severed head on pikes, which would serve as examples.\nThe artificial skin Denise wore was itching again. She couldn\u2019t wait to shed it, allowing her own smooth silver skin to breathe. Grimacing, Denise glanced down the corridor and extracted the monarch\u2019s head as well as her husband\u2019s. After focusing her energy on two peasants\u2019 skulls, they soon represented the missing leaders\u2019. No sense in causing unnecessary panic or deaths due to suspicion.\nWith the hair of the pates in each hand, Denise hurried down the long passage, glad her mission was finally completed. She inspected the queen\u2019s sightless eyes. The queen was executed for saying, \"let them eat cake\". There must be some power in this \"cake\" thing since it caused hate and death. It warranted further investigation and she would include this in the report she would present with the specimens.\nWhen she reached a dark storage alcove, Denise sighed happily, delighted that she was returning to the Mother Ship. With the queen and king\u2019s heads, she disappeared in a bright flash of silver light.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050903212707\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/janmar2001\/collectingdata.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The Internet's Premier Magazine of Historical Science Fiction","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/bk74B0N9Y1Hcq-JWBCG+Z2MAZtw.json","volume":2.0,"issues":1.0,"has_text":true}

Something that\nmight help you in making your final decision on the matter\nwhich now affects us all.\u201d\nA small group of men were sitting in the study of the speaker\u2019s\nmodestly appointed home. It was late summer, 1858, and while\nthe question of slavery bedeviled the East, here in Kansas\nCity, on the border of the Western Frontier, these men,\nthough with differing opinions on the issue, could meet\ntogether in a civilized fashion, far from the heated debates\nthat were raging in Washington.\nThe first guest, a young reporter from the New York Times,\nspoke up. \u201cYour letter to my editor stated that it\nwas of national interest, which is why I assume these other\ngentlemen are here, as well. Yet you\u2019ve been vague\nabout this whole affair. I assume that your proposal will\naddress this issue?\u201d\n\u201cYes, we\u2019d all like to hear it,\u201d one of\nthe other men, a senator from the great state of Virginia,\nsaid in an upper-class Southern drawl. \u201cFor my own\npart, I can only hope that you have found a way to avoid\na repeat of Bloody Kansas at the national level without\nthe interference of that dammed Lincoln and his republicans.\nIf so, then my hat is indeed off to you, sir.\u201d\nOne of the Northern senators scowled as if he was about\nto respond, but his companion motioned him to stay seated.\n\u201cWe should at least hear him out,\u201d he said.\nTheir host nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d He moved to\nthe center of the room and began. \u201cAs you all know,\nour country is becoming divided over the slavery issue.\nI have come to the conclusion that a war is indeed inevitable\nif a solution is not reached. We have tried compromises,\nbut they have only aggravated the situation as new states\nhave been created. Therefore, since a war may indeed be\ninevitable after the next Presidential election, I have\ncome to a decision and found a means of ensuring our country\u2019s\nsurvival, if my message can be taken back with you to Washington.\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d the Northern senator said. \u201cLet\u2019s\nhave it. What is this great solution of yours? Is it a weapon?\u201d\n\u201cIn a manner of speaking.\u201d Their host paused\nas he went over to the study\u2019s large, oak doorway.\nThere was a curtain drawn across it. They had all seen it\nearlier but had not been allowed to look behind it. There\nwas a collective gasp and looks of wonder and bewilderment\nfrom the group as the host drew the curtain back and revealed\nwhat was behind it.\nIt appeared to be some sort of mirror, with a maze of what\nlooked like telegraph cables snaking from behind it. Rows\nof levers and switches lined its side. There was a low hum\ncoming from it, such as one might hear while listening to\na telegraph pole. There was also the faint odor of burning\nair around it, as if from a lightning strike.\nThe reaction was immediate. \u201cWhat the devil?\u201d\nThe Northern senator exclaimed. \u201cSee here, if all\nyou\u2019ve done is invite us here to show us some sort\nof a trick\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo, gentlemen. Not a trick. More of a warning. Observe.\u201d\nHe threw one of the switches, and his guests involuntarily\njumped as the mirror\u2019s glass suddenly flickered and\ncame to life. The men stared as a series of images began\nflowing across the screen. It was like watching an outdoor\nplay through a window, but the images were flat, two-dimensional.\nNevertheless, they were incredibly lifelike.\nWhat they saw were images of conflict. Men in blue and grey\nuniforms-obviously representing Northern and Southern armies,\nwere battling each other on an open field. The action was\nsilent, although the guests instinctively reacted to the\nscenes of artillery fire and men on both sides falling to\nthe ground.\nThe entire presentation lasted for about ten minutes. When\nit was over, and the battle finished, the host turned off\nthe mirror machine and drew the curtain back across it.\nHe then stood and waited for their reactions.\nThe man from Virginia was the first to regain his composure.\n\u201cWhat\u2026what is that infernal machine?\u201d\n\u201cWas what we just witness real?\u201d the reporter\nasked, his own voice barely a whisper.\n\u201cYes,\u201d the host answered. \u201cI cannot go\ninto the precise details of how my machine works, save that\nit functions on principals that are directly descended from\nthose used by the telegraph, and applying a theory of time\nand energy that is an extension of Isaac Newton\u2019s\nlaws of motion. Suffice it to say that, with the proper\nmanipulation of energy and light waves, my machine can briefly\nsee and record images from the near future.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s devil\u2019s work!\u201d The second\nNorthern senator said. \u201cBlasphemy!\u201d\n\u201cNo, it is science,\u201d the host said. \u201cI\nrealized that the world was not yet ready for such a discovery,\nso I invited you here to witness it for yourselves before\nI destroy it. No man should know too much about the future;\nmy only intention was to use it to capture images of the\nwar that I know is to come, and to show them to you so that\nyou could go back to Washington and cast your votes for\nwar or peace, knowing what is to come. I only ask that you\ntell no one about my machine, or that we ever had this conversation.\u201d\n\u2018Then why did you invite me?\u201d The reporter asked.\n\u201cI have the feeling that your services will be required\nin the conflict ahead,\u201d the host said. \u201cI wanted\nyou to see for yourself what it will be like, so that you\nmay write about it honestly, without reservation.\u201d\nThe second Northern senator looked as if he was about to\nspeak again, but his companion held up his hand. \u201cWe\naccept your terms,\u201d he said. He looked at the Southerner\nand the reporter, who both nodded in agreement. \u201cI\ncannot yet promise you how I will vote, even after seeing\nthis\u2026demonstration,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I\ncan promise you that, when the time comes, my vote will\nbe an honest one.\u201d\n\u201cAs will mine,\u201d the Virginian said. The other\nsenator said nothing, but nodded.\n\u201cThat is all I ask,\u201d the host said.\nThey left that same afternoon. When they were gone, the\nhost rode his carriage out to a field on the outskirts of\nthe city. A group of men, still dressed in the costumes\nthat they had been wearing earlier, were waiting expectantly\nfor him. Surrounding them were mirrors of various sizes\nthat had were tilted at different angles. A large screen\ndominated the field\u2019s edge.\n\u201cDid it work?\u201d the leader of the group, still\ndressed in grey, asked. \u201cWere we convincing enough?\u201d\n\u201cIndeed you were, my friend,\u201d the host answered,\nand a cheer went up from the rest of the men. \u201cYour\nperformance was impeccable. I almost regretted having to\ndeceive them this way-it would have been nice to have been\nable to show them actual images from the future-but it was\neffective. Whatever else happens, they will have received\nthe full benefits of my\u2026\u2019Invention.\u2019\u201d\nThe grey-uniformed man waved his arm at the mirrors and\nscreen that had so realistically reflected their images.\n\u201cThen you\u2019re not going to be needing any of\nthis again?\u201d\nThe host shook his head. \u201cAs I told my guests, the\nworld isn\u2019t ready for moving images yet,\u201d he\nreplied. \u201cBesides, can you imagine what kind of a\nworld it would be if there were machines like mine in every\nhome, showing the world\u2019s news and events of the day\ntwenty-four hours a day? How could such an enterprise be\nkept up without people becoming numbed by the experience?\nThey\u2019d be bored to death within a week!\u201d\nThe actor laughed. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll never know now,\nthank God,\u201d he said. He shook his head, still laughing.\n\u201cTwenty-four hours a day\u2026Good Lord!\u201d\nThe host chuckled and smiled as well. It really was the\nmost ridiculous idea. He was glad that it would never really\ncome to pass.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050905180510\/http:\/\/wouldthatitwere.com\/julysept2004\/seconddilemma.htm","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/ZWMoaAuEJN0I6-hBrp-Cq3mFzzM.json","volume":5.0,"issues":2.0,"has_text":true}

He was feeling nervous, and perhaps the most obvious sign of\nthat anxiety was his constant reaching up to adjust his tie.\nWith him were two burly interns, men who looked to be very close\ndescendants of their Darwinian forebears. They\nhad met him as he approached and one of the interns had indicated they would\nwait there until the rest of his party arrived.\nSoon, two cars pulled up alongside the kerb below.\nOut of the first stepped two more fierce-looking men, these in the employ\nof His Majesty's government. The\ndriver of the second car stepped out -- also a large man, Wells noted -- and\nthen opened the rear door of the same car.\nThe former Prime Minister, J. Ramsey MacDonald, climbed out, looking very\ngrim and serious. Both men from the first car approached him, taking up station\non either side of the man who until last November had been leader of the\ncountry.\nIf the ex-Prime Minister looked grim, these men looked positively morbid.\nPerhaps it was the thought of what could go wrong on this visit, mused\nWells, the thought of this great man even daring to consider entering such a\nfacility.\nMacDonald mounted the stairs, and a smile briefly crossed his countenance\nas he reached out a hand to Wells, before his face disappeared into the pits of\na glower again.\n\"H.G. Good to see you\nagain.\"\nWells nodded his head and allowed himself a small smile as well.\n\"And you, James. I\ntrust everything is going well?\"\n\"Ha!\" exploded the great man.\n\"Allow me to remind you of the basics of the parliamentary system\nsome time, my friend, even if you don\u2019t choose to take another run at a seat.\nI no longer run things, but we're working on that. And in the meantime, nothing but trouble with that infernal\nBaldwin and his cohorts!\"\nWells laughed politely, and then the two men turned to enter the\nhospital. The two beefy interns led\nthe way, there to clear any unwanted madmen out of their path. The two security\nmen walked slightly behind, on the watch for any danger, hopefully more imagined\nthan real.\nThe doctor Wells had met once before was at the door.\nHe couldn't remember the man\u2019s name, but supposed it didn't matter\nsince they were not here for pleasantries.\n\"Mr. MacDonald. Mr.\nWells. Welcome to Bethlem.\nHow do you gentlemen do today?\" he asked.\nThe doctor was middle-aged, developing a fair paunch around the torso,\nand losing hair on top, which he tried to cover by combing hair from one side\nover to the other. Large white flakes hung from various places on his scalp.\nHis nose was red, with a street map of many tell-tale broken capillaries.\nBoth men responded with how-do-you-do's of their own, and then the doctor\nturned to lead them beyond the lobby and to the ward where their destination\nlay. As he walked he pulled a large\nkey ring from his belt and fumbled about until he found what was obviously the\nright key. A few steps later they\nwere at the first locked doors.\n\"How is Wain today, Doctor?\" asked MacDonald.\nThe doctor cast a glance back before attempting to insert the key in the\nlock. Over the doctor's shoulder\nWells could see almost a dozen patients had gathered at the sound of the keys\nand were standing in a semi-circle around the doors, silently watching the\nlatch.\n\"The same as usual, sir,\" replied the doctor.\nHe twisted the key that he had finally managed to get into the lock, and\nthen pushed the doors open. Both\ninterns rushed ahead to herd the patients back and away, barking \u201cGet back!\u201d\nin sharp tones that echoed up and down the halls, but none seemed to be\ninterested in escaping; they all moved back silently, shuffling feet and hanging\nheads as they went.\nThe doctor closed the doors behind them and inserted the key once more,\nlocking them in. Then he stepped\naround the patients and led the way again.\nAs they walked, Wells let his eyes rove about, keenly taking in details.\nThere were several closed sets of doors to the left, and what appeared to\nbe a common area not too far ahead. To\ntheir right as they walked was another set of double doors, from behind which\ncame moans, screams and other wretched noises often popularly associated with\nthe mad. He briefly paused to look\nin through the wire and glass, only to jump back startled as a patient flung\nhimself against the door, causing it to shake.\nA trail of spittle was left on the glass as madman slowly sank to the\nfloor, dazed from the impact or perhaps drugged with something that was only now\ntaking effect.\nBehind him one of the two guards MacDonald had brought along chuckled,\nand the former Prime Minister said, \"Good job, Wells.\nNothing like giving them a reason to get all worked up.\"\nFace flushed, Wells turned and rejoined the entourage, trying his best to\nignore the sounds still emanating from behind those doors.\nThe doctor still walked in front, consulting with one of the large\ninterns and waving off requests from other staff members that tried to approach\nthe party. The quietly insane that inhabited this ward lined the walls,\nwatching their unlikely, well-dressed visitors with a sort of unattached, vacant\ncuriosity, as if they were of interest only because they were there, and that\nwould all change as soon as they were out of sight.\nMovement and colour in an otherwise dormant, static world.\n\"Doesn't say much for your hopes for a utopian society, now, does it\nWells?\" commented MacDonald.\nWells looked at him with a side-long glance, trying to judge if he was\nbeing put-upon or if the man was serious. Wells\nhimself had run twice for the Labour Party; the second time MacDonald had formed\na minority government, although Wells himself had been unsuccessful both times.\nAs well, they had both been members of the Fabian Society, and yet he\nstill had trouble figuring the man out. But\nfor now he decided now that this was no joke, that MacDonald was indeed feeling\nvery grim about their surroundings.\n\"I still think it is possible,\" replied Wells. \u201cWe should\nstart with sterilizing all these poor creatures and those who have a history of\ncreating them. Stop the blood-lines\nbefore they take over the world.\u201d He\nswept his arm about, taking in all of so-called modern psychiatry in one\ngesture. \"And then, I think that sooner than you\nmight think we will be seeing some wondrous scientific and humanitarian\nachievements that should make this a thing of the dark ages.\" At this the doctor grunted, but made no further comment.\nWells chose not to pursue it.\nMacDonald snorted. \"Sooner\nthan I might think could still be a thousand years away, Wells. Too many stains,\ntoo many stains.\" He picked up\nhis pace, obviously through with the conversation for now.\nThe rest of the party sped up in kind.\nThey stopped outside a room with a lock on the door.\nAn intern moved to unlock it but the doctor held up his hand.\n\"This is where Wain spends his days and nights, gentlemen.\nThe lock is by his request, not ours.\nHe wanted one that he could lock himself, but that is of course against\nhospital policy.\n\"So he has settled for this, although not happily, I can assure you.\nHe will request that the door be locked again when you go in to visit,\nand I highly doubt that he will allow any more than the two of you in.\"\nBoth guards started forward at this, but then MacDonald stopped them with\na wave of the hand.\n\"How fast can your men unlock the door and get into the room?\"\nhe asked.\n\"Scant seconds, sir. But\ndon't worry. Wain is anything but\ndangerous.\"\n\"Very well.\" He\nturned to his two guards. \"You\ncan make do with standing out here and watching through the peephole.\"\nThen he turned to the doctor. \"We're\nready to go in.\"\nThe intern opened the door and Wells stepped into the room, then\nMacDonald. It was small and\nfunctional. Perhaps ten feet by\ntwelve, a cot with one lumpy pillow and a threadbare blanket along one wall and\na toilet and sink in the opposite corner. A\nsmall table with a lamp sat at the head of the cot, a copy of the Times\nwith a headline from one day last week taking up the rest of the table space.\nIn the middle of the small room there stood an easel with a canvas on it,\na painting in progress. So far it had taken no form that Wells could discern;\nmerely splotches of colour in a few seemingly random locations, as if the artist\nwas still searching for the best way to attack his subject.\nThe artist himself stood beside the easel, eyes wide and darting to and\nfro. He clutched furiously at the\nbrush in his right hand, his knuckles turning white.\n\"Louis,\" Wells said softly.\nWain fixed him with a stare for a brief second, long enough for Wells to\ntell that he was with them in the here and now, but that it likely wouldn't last\nlong. \"H.G.,\" he gasped.\n\"Mr. Prime Minister. So...\nvery good to see you... again.\"\nBoth men smiled, trying to be disarming and peaceful in their looks and\ntheir actions. MacDonald took two slow steps forward, towards the painting.\n\"What are you working on, Wain?\"\nHis tone was cautious, his stance relaxed.\nWells knew that he didn't feel that way, but his years in politics had\ntrained him to project what his audience needed.\nWain glanced at the painting, eyes wide, as if he feared it would tell\nsomething about him, perhaps even betray him.\nWhich, mused Wells, it was entirely possible that he did.\n\"Just, just, just a piece, sir, a piece about, about...\"\nHe bit his lower lip, unable to carry on.\n\"Cats?\" prodded Wells, softly.\nThe artist moaned loudly, and under the wretched sound Wells heard a\nscratching at the door. He turned his head halfway and out of the corner of his eye\nthought he saw something small at the foot of the door, but when he turned his\nhead all the way it wasn't there. The\nsound must have come from one of the nervous guards on the other side.\nMacDonald cleared his throat. \"You\nhad wanted to talk to us, Wain?\"\nWain paced around behind the canvas, appearing for one moment to be\nstalking something, the next to be hiding.\n\"I... I wanted to thank you for, for getting me out.\nOut of the, the, the poor ward.\" Wells wryly observed that MacDonald\nwas standing even straighter.\n\"It's nice,\" continued Wain, gesturing around the room.\n\"I mean, I mean, I know I'm still... crackers, still, still not\nwell, but here I can paint, can, can... I like it better here.\" He smiled at the relief of having made it this far.\n\"We were glad to be of service,\" said Wells.\nThe year before, in 1924, Wells and MacDonald, then in the middle of his\nshort eleven-month stint as Prime Minister, had discovered that Wain was shut\naway in the pauper ward of a mental institution.\nThey had started a fund to save him from this terrible fate, and a short\nwhile ago had managed to have him transferred to the Bethlem Royal Hospital.\nIn the 1890's and the early part of this century, Louis Wain had been one\nof the most successful artists in all of England.\nHis humourous paintings of cats in human situations had become hugely\npopular, and Wain could turn out literally hundreds of drawings and paintings\nevery year.\nBut he was not a very good businessman; when he sold his paintings he\nrelinquished the rights as well, and when his work began to fall out of favour,\ndue to many imitators and to changing public tastes, he sank into poverty.\nAfter the Great War he had begun his long descent into madness and\nextreme paranoia, finally being institutionalised in 1923.\nWain dabbed a small amount of paint on his brush and stabbed at the\ncanvas with it, then continued. \"I\nalso wanted to tell, tell you that I'm going to be... to be having my own, own,\nshow.\"\n\"By God!\" announced MacDonald.\n\"That's fabulous, Wain. Where\nshall it be?\"\nWain cringed a bit at this booming outburst, but continued.\n\"At, at the Twenty-One Gallery.\nThis, this, this October, I think. Or\nso they tell me...\" This\nsentence didn't so much end as it trailed off.\nWells smiled. \"That's excellent news, Louis. You must be very proud.\"\nThe artist smiled back, very briefly, and then dropped his gaze down to\nthe floor. \"Thank you for, for\ncoming.\"\nBoth men responded with farewells and then turned to leave, but Wells,\nbehind MacDonald, felt Wain's hand fall briefly and lightly on his arm.\n\"Please stay for one more moment?\" Wain asked in a small,\nscared voice.\nWells nodded, then stuck his head out the door.\n\"I'll be out in a moment. He\nseems to want to speak to me privately.\"\nIgnoring the irritated look that crossed MacDonald's face, he ducked back\nin and slowly walked back to near where Wain was standing, hearing the lock on\nthe door click behind him. There he\nstood quietly, waiting for the artist to speak.\n\"They're back, Wells,\" he said eventually, \"They're\nback.\" His face looked pale\nand haunted now.\nWells, fully understanding the depths of the paranoia that gripped this\npoor man, did his best to sound sympathetic.\n\"Who are back, Louis?\"\nWain pointed to the canvas. What\nhad been a random collection of colours just minutes ago had now taken shape as\na group of cats, although Wells could swear that Wain had only touched the\ncanvas one or two brief times.\nHe stared at the painting, trying to fathom what was happening here.\nThere were three cats in the painting, and while the style was\nrecognizably Wain's, the cats were not posed in the jolly fashion Wells was\naccustomed to seeing in Wain's work. Instead,\nthe three cats, while posed as humans on their hind legs, seemed to be\nmaliciously toying with something that had yet to be finished, that appeared so\nfar as only a pale yellow blob.\n\"This certainly isn't what we've grown accustomed to expect from\nyou, Louis,\" said Wells. The\nmadness must have really taken its toll.\nWain shuddered, as if he were holding in a great sob.\nThen he staggered over to the cot and sat at the end of it, paints and\nbrush still in his hands. \"It\nisn't, it isn't what I, what I want,\" he said.\nHis voice was breaking, and Wells was sure he would begin to cry like a\nchild at any moment. \u201cI try to\nleave them out of it, but they keep, keep, keep coming back.\u201d\nWain looked back at the painting, and the look of stark terror that\ncrossed his face transfixed Wells for the moment.\nThen he said, \"I'm sorry, H.G.\nSo very sorry,\" in a voice that was almost less than a whisper.\n\"The cats, oh, the cats...\"\nHis voice trailed off again and he gradually tilted over until gravity\nwon out over his muscles and his face fell to the mattress.\nWells turned to go back to summon the doctor, but his eyes tracked\nquickly past the canvas with the cats on it and then snapped back.\nThere was now a figure, seemingly human rather than feline, lying in a f\u015btal\nposition beneath the three cats, obviously the object of their tortures.\nBut that was impossible! Wain\nhad sat down, had not been near the canvas!\nWells' eyes cast about the room, feverishly looking for another, logical\nexplanation for the anomaly in the painting.\nHe could find none. He\nrubbed his eyes and looked again, but it was still there.\nWas this form of madness contagious?\nHe looked back to Wain, hoping to find an answer there, but the man had\nhis face buried in the covers and was mumbling to himself; a long line of drool\nhung from the corner of his lips to the tattered blanket.\nAnother scratching sound came from the far corner opposite the door, and\nwhen Wells turned to look there he caught a brief glimpse of something small and\nblack. Too brief, though; he feared\nit had been just a trick of the light or his mind.\nThen he looked back at the painting, and froze in horror.\nThe figure now had its face turned towards Wells, and it was a face he\nrecognized well. It was Jane, his\nwife!\nShe looked frightful. Her\nface was long and drawn out, her beautiful hair matted and coarse, and her\nnormally droopy, sad eyes were wide open, a look of terror and extreme agony in\nthem. Her cheekbones were sunken, and she was dressed in her\nbedclothes.\nShock settled into Wells. He\ncould do nothing but stare at the canvas, horrified by the sight.\nIt took him a moment to lose the feeling of helplessness, but it\nimmediately came back when he realized that the painting had slowly changed\npositions, the figures moving at some glacial pace so that he did not notice\ntheir movements but could see their new placement.\n\"Dear God,\" he whispered.\nAnother scratching sound came from the right, but Wells was too caught up\nin the tableau to look. The cat on\nthe right side of the painting, a simple orange alley cat, had bent all the way\nover and was now using one claw to gouge a line in the flesh of Jane's cheek.\nBright, unnaturally red blood welled up, oozing out of the fresh wound\nmore slowly than blood had the right to flow.\nWells could feel his gorge begin to rise; the taste of bile was sharp in\nthe back of his throat. He turned\nhis head away, and jumped back at the sight that greeted him now, knocking over\nthe canvas in the process.\nWain was still lying on the cot, but now more than a dozen cats stood\naround him and over him. All were silent, except for the padding of their feet\nif they moved, and the distant scratching sounds as several dug their claws into\nWain's back, arms and legs. He\ncould see Wain shudder and shake each time a cat scratched him, but the artist\nalso made no sound. One cat, which\nWells realised with even greater horror was the orange one from the painting,\nturned and looked him in the eye, staring calmly at Wells for a second before\narching its back, flattening its ears, and hissing.\nThe sound of the cat broke Wells out of his horrified reverie.\nHe turned and stumbled for the door, kicking the canvas that he had\nknocked over a moment before. His\neyes cast down once more to the abominable thing, like steel to a magnet.\nThe painting had changed once more.\nNow four numbers were jaggedly scrawled across the width of it;\n\"1927\" it said, in a most sickly grey.\nOne glance at the painting of Jane showed him that she, or at least the\nfigure in the painting, now appeared to be dead, although there was now no blood\nto be seen. The cats were no longer\nanywhere in the picture.\nHe pulled on the door, it wouldn't open, knocked frantically and when the\ndoor opened he staggered out, gasping for air.\nHe heard the door shut behind him, and disembodied hands held him up\nwhile similarly removed voices chattered at him in a fashion beyond\ncomprehension.\nGradually, his breathing calmed down, and his vision returned.\nHe looked around.\nAn intern was holding him up, and the doctor was examining him worriedly.\nMacDonald looked on in concern, and the others watched with interest as\nwell. Only the mad that shuffled by\npaid him no heed, already used to such behaviour on a regular basis.\n\"Are you all right?\" asked the doctor, at the same time that\nMacDonald asked, \"What happened in there?\"\nWells waved them both off. \"Nothing,\nnothing,\" he said, \"Just my claustrophobia acting up, is all. Can we get outside?\"\nWouldn't do to tell them what he saw.\nJust be locked up like Wain and the rest of these poor mad souls.\nMacDonald nodded and marched off. The\nintern who wasn't holding onto Wells and the two guards hurried to catch him,\nand Wells slowly followed, careful to keep his eyes down.\nThe one time he did look up there were three inmates standing only a few\nfeet away. Each man seemed to be\nunaware that he had a cat sitting on his shoulders, and each of the cats were\nintently watching Wells as he walked by. He\nsucked in a breath and did his best not to whimper, then looked back to the\nfloor and picked up his pace.\nWells said farewell to MacDonald and the doctor and then staggered away,\ntoo in shock to call a cab, first trying to understand, and then rationalise,\nwhat he saw.\nWhatever it was, he couldn't face Jane now.\nHe resolved to leave for his home in France that night, to join his love\nOdette at Lou Pidou.\nTo get away from cats forever.\nFrance,\n1927\nJane had joined him for his lecture at the Sorbonne, and then shortly\nafterwards they went back to England for the wedding between their son Gip and\nH.G.'s best secretary, Marjorie. The\nday after the wedding he again returned to France.\nHe spent most of his time writing, but on the tenth of May a letter from\nhis son Frank arrived in the post.\nJane had cancer. Had been ill when he had seen her, and had not told him.\nHe set down the letter and immediately wrote a quick note to Jane, to\ntell her he loved her, and that he was coming home to help her. He wanted to\nwrite that he would see her through her recovery, but before the letter could\nget that far there was a scratching at the door of his study.\nHe slowly looked up, hands shaking and mouth dry.\nA cat stood there, one he had never seen around the house before.\nCats were not allowed in Lou\nPidou, his unwavering decree. It\nstared at him for a moment, then arched its back, flattened its ears, and hissed\nat him, before turning and walking out. It\nwas the same orange cat from two years before.\nWells was still for a moment, then he exploded out of his chair and raced\nto the door. The cat was nowhere to be seen.\nHe shuffled back to his study, feeling an odd combination of defeat and\nrelief, feeling that what Wain and the cats had shown him was just about over.\nHe went to his desk, but instead of sitting he lay down on the floor\nunderneath, curled up much like Wain had been two years before.\n\"I have had Frank's letter today and for the first time I learned\nhow seriously ill you have been & that you may still be very ill.\nMy dear, I love you much more than I have loved anyone else in the world\n& I am coming back to you to take care of you & to do all I can to make\nyou happy... My dear, my dear, my\ndearest heart is yours.\nYour loving Bins.\"\n-\nExcerpt from a letter from H.G. Wells to Jane Wells.\n\"...my little wife has to die of cancer & I want to spend what\ntime remains of her life with her...\"\n-\nExcerpt from a letter from H.G. Wells to Margaret Sanger, written before leaving\nFrance.\n\"...and H.G. -- H.G. positively howled.\nYou are no doubt aware that he was not a conventionally perfect\nhusband... O it was hideous --\nterrible and frightful... The way of transgressors is hard...\"\n- Excerpt from a letter from Charlotte Shaw to T.E. Lawrence on the funeral of Jane Wells.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050421121801\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/octdec2001\/cats.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The Internet's Premier Magazine of Historical Science Fiction","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/lyo8rVsUSGlagL1hKrPYtl8h88c.json","volume":2.0,"issues":3.0,"has_text":true}

Ah, the bomb had detonated! No more parades for Franz Ferdinand and Sophie. That would show Austria-Hungary that Serbia and the associationof the Black Hand were not to be toyed with! Smiling with the deepest satisfaction, Gavrilo Princip turned to edge through the sharp cries of \"What was that?\" and \"It sounded like a bomb!\"\nAn abrupt tug at his elbow brought him up short.

When this white lever,\" he pointed to a tiny\npiece of bric-a-brac on the model, \"is pressed forward,\nit will travel into time and we shall never see it again!\n\"Now,\"\nhe turned to us smiling, \"who of you would like the honor\nof launching this machine on its eternal voyage?\" The\nProvincial Mayor excused himself to refill his pipe, so the\nTime Traveller fastened his pale grey eyes on Filby. Filby\nin turn looked at the Medical Man, who was looking at the\nPsychologist, who nodded to me. As one, we turned to look\nupon the Young Man.\n\"I'd\nbe delighted to!\" the Young Man said effusively. He was\nVery young.\n\"Splendid,\"\nsaid the Time Traveller. He directed the Young Man's finger\nonto the lever, then stood well back. We all saw the lever\nturn.\nThere\nwas a breath of wind, the candles flickered, and the little\nmachine suddenly swung round, became indistinct, was seen\nas a ghost for a second perhaps, as an eddy of faintly glittering\nbrass and ivory; and it was gone -- vanished! \"Ow!\"\nexclaimed the Young Man, and he put his finger in his mouth.\n\"I'll\nbe damned,\" Filby said softly. Scarcely had the words\nescaped his lips when a tremendous clattering and groaning\ncommenced, as if all the dead were rising from their crypts\nto take him up on his offer. Then, to complete our already\nprofound amazement, a large oblong crate, resembling nothing\nso much as a bobby's blue call box, manifested itself in the\nmidst of our little gathering, exactly where the octagonal\ntable holding the model Time Machine had stood.\n\"A\nmost remarkable illusion,\" said the ashen-faced Medical\nMan.\nThe\nmoment the box had taken firm substance, a door in its side\nopened and two creatures -- one a tall and wild-eyed man,\nthe other, God help me, a small white dog wearing a polka\ndot bow tie and horn-rimmed glasses -- spilled out, arguing\nheatedly.\n\"Professor\nPeabody,\" the man bellowed, \"are you absolutely\ncertain this is the point of origin?\"\n\"Beyond\na shadow of a doubt, Doctor,\" the dog replied testily.\nBehind\nthem, a greasy-looking, disturbingly well-armed thug slipped\nquietly out of the box. \"Are we there yet?\" he asked.\n\"Of\ncourse!\" replied the Doctor and the Professor in unison.\nThe\nthug leveled a large black pistol at the Time Traveller. \"Should\nI kill him now or do you want to interrogate him first?\"\n\"Put\nthat thing away, Ratty,\" the Doctor suggested. He turned\nto our host. \"You must forgive the Stainless Steel Rat;\nhe's so impulsive sometimes.\"\nMuch\nto our relief, Ratty smashed down the door to the outer hall\nand took his leave. At that point we noticed that a half dozen\ndwarves in Napoleonic uniforms had clambered out of the box\nand begun stuffing the candlesticks and silverware into a\nlarge sack.\nOur\nhost leapt to his feet, livid with anger. The Doctor, however,\nturned his back and called to two very befuddled looking gentlemen\nwho'd hesitantly followed the dwarves out of the box, \"You\nthere! Martin Padway, Billy Pilgrim! Get back inside, you're\nsafe there!\"\nThe\ndog called Peabody caught our host by the sleeve. \"Are\nyou in charge here?\"\n\"Yes!\"\nhe snapped, finding his voice at last. \"And I -- \"\n\"Then\nyou must be the imbecile responsible for this,\" Peabody\nsaid, as he lightly tossed the model Time Machine onto the\nsettee.\n\"I\ndemand to know what you're doing in my drawing room!\"\n\"You\ndemand?\" roared the Doctor, as he spun around. \"I\nshould bloody well think I get to do some demanding! Thanks\nto you I've got two hundred Wimps in here\" -- he slapped\nthe side of the blue crate -- \"looking for an airplane\nto crash in. What am I supposed to do with them?\"\n\"Now\nnow, Doctor, calm yourself,\" suggested Professor Peabody.\n\"And as for you,\" he added, to our host, \"be\ngrateful the nexus was too small for the Nimitz to fit through.\"\n\"Eh?\"\nsaid our host (under the circumstances a rather astute observation,\nI thought).\n\"Never\nmind,\" said Peabody, \"the point is this: your little\ntoy has caused a temporal backwash fifty centuries long and\nat least a dozen continua wide. All manner of time travellers\nwere sucked into the disturbance. You, sir, are single-handedly\nresponsible for the worst case of time pollution I have ever\nseen.\"\nFive\nmen, carrying large rifles and outfitted for a safari, stepped\nout of the box and looked around. \"Don't look like tyrannosaur\ncountry to me,\" one at the rear of the group grumbled.\n\"Shut\nup, Eckels,\" said the frontmost one, with some authority.\n\"How\nwas I to know about side effects?!\" our host demanded.\n\"I've only recently begun experimenting with time travel!\"\n\"Oh\nLord,\" Professor Peabody sighed, \"a damned amateur.\"\nHe removed his glasses, thoughtfully chewed an earpiece for\na moment, then tapped our host on the chest. \"Look, Mister\nwhatever-your-name-is, time is in bad enough shape without\nevery fool gentleman-scientist dicking around with it.\"\n\"I\n-- !\" our host sputtered.\n\"Do\nus all a favor,\" the Doctor snarled. \"Leave time\ntravel to the professionals, okay?\" Without waiting for\nan answer, the Doctor turned to the assembled mob, which by\nnow had grown quite large. \"All right,\" he bawled,\n\"everyone back inside, we're getting out of here! Jherek\nCarnelian, that means you, too!\"\nUnnoticed,\nRatty had slipped back into the room and was sidling up to\nthe Traveller. \"I'll give you a piece of friendly advice,\"\nhe said softly, as he sliced off our host's cravat with a\nrazor-tipped fingernail. \"If I were you, I'd scrap that\nmachine in the back room before the Spiders and Snakes find\nout about it and drop a battalion of Change Warriors in your\ngarden.\" Then he smiled, shot the model Time Machine\nto pieces, and stepped into the box. The door closed, the\ngroaning recommenced, and in a few moments the box had vanished.\nEveryone\nwas silent for perhaps a minute, and then the Psychologist\nspoke up. \"Well,\" he huffed, \"they certainly\nwere a rude lot.\" Our host sank deep into his plush velvet\nchair; silent, bemused, and seriously nursing his brandy.\n\"I\nsay,\" the Young Man exclaimed brightly, \"this time\ntravel business does sound frightfully exciting.\" He\nfailed to notice the glares that focused upon him.\nThere\ncame an insistent rapping at the front door, and our host\nat last roused himself. \"Filby,\" he said wearily,\n\"I gave the servants the evening off. Be a good fellow\nand answer the door, will you?\" Filby got up and left\nthe room.\n\"Is\nit true?\" the Young Man blithely continued, \"what\nthat Rat fellow said? About you having another Time Machine?\"\n\"Look,\nI really don't want to talk about it,\" our host said\npeevishly. \"I want to talk about something else.\"\n\"Tell\nus about your mother,\" suggested the Psychologist.\n\"Martians!\"\nexclaimed the Young Man. (\"Spare us,\" muttered the\nMedical Man.) \"You tell such smashing good stories about\nMartians,\" the Young Man insisted.\n\"Oh,\nvery well then,\" our host acquiesced. \"Uh...

These were truly grand structures, and to me a symbol of what\nMother is able to accomplish.\nThere\nwere already a few Siblings and their Arbitrators in the hall when we\narrived, probably allowed extra Comfort time as a reward for\nvolunteering for special labor assignments. Their armbands\nsignified they belonged to Litter B-Strain704, making them a few years\nolder than us. One of them was sitting at the wooden table used\nfor chess and draughts, frowning as if in deep thought- which is\nsomething I rarely see even among my brighter siblings - staring at\nthe pieces in front of him. I walked to his table and stood\nwithin his view, but he failed to notice me. I studied him as he\nin turn studied the board. He was rather handsome, and unusually\nthin, a very rare trait but one I share with him. I guessed he\nwas about 30 terms old, a few my senior. Oddly, though his mind\nwas no doubt occupied with some issue, the pieces on his board were in\nstarting position- he wasn't working on a chess problem. This\npiqued my interest. Probably he was thinking of some common,\ntrivial thing- a woman, extra Herb rations - but what if this man was\nactually engaged in real thought?\nLet\nme clarify. I divide the mysterious process by which our souls\nponder over that which we know into two types - thinking, the daily,\nmenial process which everyone, even the disturbed, goes through when\nperforming physical labor or deciding which game to play - and\nthought, the contemplation of what I call the Nature of Things.\nI have difficulty explaining this further, since, I would guess from\nmy attempted verbal engagements with my other Siblings, I am the only\none who does such a thing. Had I now met another like me, one\nwho engages in such thought?\nIt\ntook me a while to gather up the courage, but at length I decided I\nmust talk to this man- had to find out what, if anything, occupied his\nthought. \u201dPardon me, Sibling,\u201c- he looked up suddenly, as if\njerked out of a nap-\u201cI notice you seem troubled by something- or if\nnot troubled, then. . . interested. In something.\u201d\nHe\nconsidered me for what seemed like minutes, but was probably only a\nsecond or two. Then his eyes narrowed and his lips almost broke\na smile, a peculiar expression both good-natured and mocking.\n\u201cSibling,\u201c\nhe said,\u201cyou wouldn't believe me if told you. Run along and\nplay hop scotch with the other idiots. \u201d\nI\nwas shocked. Never in my life had I been spoken to like this by\na fellow Sibling! My face turned red and I felt a sting of resentment\nas I glanced reflexively to see if an Arbitrator was close enough to\nhave heard it. But I controlled myself, realizing that perhaps I\nwas right about this man- he was unusual, certainly, and the\nconfidence of his manner indicated he was indeed of good intellectual\nand emotional stock. I had to make him understand that I was his\nequal.\n\u201cFriend,\ndon't scorn me so hastily. Play me a game of chess, I'll show\nyou who is the bigger fool. \u201d\n\u201cI've\nnever been matched in the game, not nearly. Ordinarily, I'd play\nyou for the amusement of a quick slaughter. But as you could\nsee, I'm busy with a problem of my own. Toddle off, then, little\nSibling. \u201d\n\u201cOne\nwho is so sure of himself would surely not hesitate to play an amateur\n- for a wager. \u201d\n\u201cWager?\u201d\nHe was suddenly interested, I could tell, since he dropped that\nmocking expression of his.\n\u201cA\nration of Herb. Unless that's too much of a risk? If not,\nperhaps just a stick of tobacco, then?\u201c\n\u201cHa!\nA ration of Herb it is. I suppose that would be worth a few\nminutes of my time. Here, sit down. You can even have\nwhite. \u201d\nWe\nbegan the game. I decided to play an experimental strategy of my\nown, one I had developed over long hours in my cell using pieces I had\nmade out of various odds and ends. He played brutally, and quite\nwell, his attacks wearing down my defenses and complicating my master\nplan, but not disrupting it entirely. As our game went on (much\nlonger than \u201ca few minutes of his time\u201c), I carefully positioned\nmy pieces for my closing strike, cloaking my true purpose by making it\nseem as if I were moving them into a standard defensive formation.\nThis was difficult, as fending off his various maneuvers would have\nbeen complicated even without the necessity of eventually winning the\ngame. Finally, when all was ready, I struck - and he watched\nwith intense frustration as I rendered his remaining rook helpless,\nthen took both bishops, then a pawn. He cursed loudly at each\nloss, and I looked about each time he did this, worried an Arbitrator\nwould hear him- he seemed unconcerned about such a possibility.\nThen, after his last counterattack (which almost broke my formation),\nI took his queen and trapped his king in one brilliant move.\n\u201cCheckmate.\n\u201d\nHe\nsat there for a moment, staring in disbelief. Then he grinned at\nme.\n\u201cDamn\nit all, Sibling, you've beaten me! All right, here's your ration.\nCare for a rematch?\u201d\n\u201cNot\nnow. But I would like to know what was in your thoughts before I\napproached you. \u201d\n\u201cUmm.\n. . I'd rather not say. You'd be shocked. \u201d\nShocked!\nThen he had indeed been in thought!\n\u201cI\nwould not be shocked. Look, Sibling, you still seem to think I'm\nsome common fool, though I've beaten you at chess, the first to have\ndone so. \u201d\n\u201cAny\nfool can play good chess. Learning a set of rules and then\napplying standard strategies to a game is one thing; but thinking\u201c-\nand he said the word with a reverence which told me that he, too, had\nsingled out a higher kind of contemplation -\u201cis something else\nentirely. Let me ask you a question, Sibling, a question I've\nasked many but never with an adequate reply. . . what do you\nthink about?\u201c\nI\ndidn't know what to tell him, but it couldn't be the truth\u2026 I will\nhave to lie, I thought to myself, even if it meant losing the chance\nto show this man that I was his equal. But before I could open my\nmouth he had seen the split-second hesitation in my face.\n\u201cYou\ncan tell me, Sibling, \u201che said. \u201cIf you're hiding something because\nit would get you in trouble, we are probably of the same mind,\u201c and\nsomething in this man's nature and\nmanner seemed so absolutely sincere that I couldn't help but\nreconsider. I looked at him for a few moments, and then, in a\nmove so bold and reckless that even today I cannot believe I actually\ncarried it out, I told him everything.\n\u201cI\nthink of the Womb, the way it is set up. I think of the\nMotherhood and their Acolytes, their Priestesses, the things they\nteach us in Congregation. . . \u201c\nI\ntook a deep breath. \u201cSometimes,\u201c I continued, \u201cI don't believe\nwhat they say- their stories about the Conception, the Birth from\nChaos, all that. But those doubts\nusually pass\u2026 mostly, though, I daydream. \u201d\n\u201cWhat\nabout?\u201d His face now displayed amazement, an amusing contrast from\nhis detached insolence only minutes ago.\n\u201cMostly\nabout someday applying for Service - I want to be an Acolyte, but not\none of the Arbitrators, that's a job for brutes and bullies. I\nmade fantastic marks on my Examination\u2026 perhaps they'd make me an\nAdministrator at a workshop, I'm good with organization and I think I\ncould lead the workers well\u2026 maybe I could even serve as an\nassistant to the Sages! I know that they use assistants, I've been to\na Chamber of Sages before - they have two, but Siblings aren't allowed\nin the other - to replace the piping on some furnaces they had been\nusing for some experiment\u2026 Sometimes - and I'm telling you this\nbecause I trust that you won't laugh at me - sometimes I even dream of\nbecoming the Blessed Husband to the Mother Priestess. Stop\nlaughing - it's farfetched, of course, but I can dream\u2026 if nothing\nelse. \u201d\nHe\njust sat there, and I could tell he was once again engaged in thought.\nAs he looked me over (in that penetrating way of his), I reflected\nwith astonishment that I had really told him my most secret thoughts -\nthoughts I usually kept hidden from even myself, in the back of my\nmind, without acknowledgment; thoughts that, if spoken to the wrong\nperson (and almost everyone is the wrong person in this case), would\nsurely be conveyed to the Security Acolytes and result in my\nMiscarriage. I shuddered at the chance I had just taken.\nBut was it really a chance? This man seemed to care little for rules,\nand wouldn't dream of informing on me, even for a reward.\nWould\nhe?\nFinally,\nhe spoke- slowly, and with care, glancing out of the corner of his eye\nto make sure no one was near.\n\u201cSibling,\nyou've impressed me. Now I will tell you what I was thinking of.\nIn these daydreams of yours, have you ever thought of someday\nventuring. . . Outside?\u201d\n\u201cBy\nMother, no! Are you mad! One could not step into the Throes of Chaos\nand live-\u201c\n\u201cShhh!\nKeep your damned voice down! Listen, I have something to tell you- no,\ncalm down first. Ready? Friend, I know one can go Outside and\nlive, because I know men who have. \u201d\n\u201cWho?\nHow?\u201d\n\u201cProduction\nAcolytes, ones who have worked in the Outside. They actually\nspend months out there at a time, without any real harm to themselves,\ndoing a complicated sort of labor. . . umm. . . have you\never wondered where our meals come from? Or the tobacco and Herb?\u201d\n\u201cWhy,\nfrom the Breast of Mother-\u201c then I caught myself, realizing that I\ndidn't believe anything of the sort. The doctrines of Mother,\nthat her Essence supplies our needs and wants, that all things spring\nfrom her, was of course the only possible explanation for- well, for\nanything! How could we be if we be not in our Mother's Womb? But\nalways I had difficulty really believing it, because there were so\nmany loose ends, so to speak, so many unanswered questions I had asked\nour Litter Mother only to be told, \u201cThus it is so with our Mother,\nthus it is written, and do you argue with what Mother ordains?\u201d, a\ntruly unhelpful response.\n\u201cWell,\u201c\nI started over, \u201cI really don't believe that, about the Breast and\nall that. But then where could it all come from?\u201d\n\u201cFrom\nOutside! They, the Acolytes assigned to this work, create the food.\nOne Acolyte, who only entrusted me with this because he had been a\nfriend of mine since childhood, told me they cause the food to spring\nfrom the floor of the Outside, but slowly, not all at once. I\nlong to find out how this is done\u2026\u201c\nThen\nhe paused - it was his turn to decide whether to risk his neck on a\nstranger's trust.\n\u201cMy\nquestion, friend,\u201c he said quietly, leaning in closer to me, \u201cis do\nyou wish to venture with me. . . Outside?\u201d\nI\ncannot explain to you the conflict within my soul that this one\nquestion incited within me. Did I want to go Outside? The very\nthought excited me so much that I couldn't help but shake all over,\ntaken by a kind of horrible ecstasy like a puff of the Herb after\nseveral days of abstaining.\nThis\nman- this stranger! - had asked me to go with him Outside, a\npossibility I had of course never entertained before since I regarded\nit as certain death. The thought had never crossed my mind, of\ncourse- it was like longing to throw oneself into a waste\ndisintegrator, it was preposterous, obviously fatal. But he had\nawakened within me a wave of excitement like nothing I had felt since\nmy first days of Schooling, learning from the Lesser Sages, a new\nworld of knowledge opened to me to do as I would with it!\nhad\nto answer him, but as yet I knew not what to answer!\n\u201cI\ndo not know. Outside- let me have some time. Will you meet\nme here at this same time of day, perhaps tomorrow, and I will give\nyou my answer?\u201d\n\u201cI'll\nhave to put in more work in the morning to get the extra Comfort time,\nbut perhaps you are worth it. . . I could use the help. . .\nOkay, I'll be here. But have an answer for me. And don't\ngo around talking about this, you understand?\u201d\nAs\nif I would tell someone!\n\u201cYes.\nBut, tell me. . . how are you planning to go outside? What with\nthe Acolytes and-\u201c\nSuddenly\nhe began laughing and said in a loud voice, \u201cHah! That's a good one,\nfriend! Well, maybe I'll rematch you tomorrow, if I'm in the mood for\nanother game,\u201c just as an Arbitrator walked up to him from behind me.\n\u201cC'mon,\nnow, Collus, let's get you to your cell! Get along now with the\nothers, playtime is over!\u201c the wretched Acolyte roared in that\nannoying manner they often have when dealing with Siblings.\nCollus stood up, nodded to me, and followed his Litter Siblings and\nArbitrators as they filed out of the room.\nI\nsat at that table for the rest of my Hour, playing absentmindedly with\nthe pieces and thinking of the Outside.\nWhich\nbrings me back to my cell, where I had been pacing for Mother knows\nhow long. I stopped in mid-step, having counted 4 paces and being\n3 short of the long end, went to my shelf, and gazed at my prized\npossessions- two bound books. One was the Annals of the\nMotherhood, standard issue to any Sibling who passes his Examination,\ndetailing the history of the Motherhood and the tenets of the Faith.\nI opened it to the front and read the memorable first few lines:\nIn the\nbeginning all was chaos- man was wild and untamed, having no one to\nguide him. Men fought and struggled, tried and failed, and there\nwas much gnashing of teeth. Then Mother caused Herself to be,\nand She, through her Mercy and Love, took these wild ones into her\nsacred Womb and brought light and warmth to those who had known only\ndarkness and cold. From her command sprung the Mother Priestess,\nher own Divine Being who would live among these men, tame them, and\nguide them so that they might attain true Security.\nDid\nI truly believe any of this? \u201cMother caused Herself to be\u201c? It\ndoesn't sound possible, but perhaps man's mind is not meant to grasp\nsuch Divine Acts, as the Motherhood says.\nI\nput down the Annals and picked up my other book, The Engine and the\nFlame, which I had obtained under unusual circumstances. One of\nthe Sages who taught me during my Schooling days took a special liking\nto me, I being the brightest in the class. At Graduation, he\ntook me aside and gave me the book, telling me of its history- written\nby another Sage almost 100 terms before, printed without permission on\nthe School's equipment, it was ordained as Heresy shortly after it was\ndiscovered by the Priestesses. Most copies were burned, only a\nfew surviving in the hands of those who could not bear to part with\nthem, even at risk of Miscarriage (which, of course, was the fate of\nthe author). The book is a fictional account of an unusually\nbright Acolyte who struggles to invent a new kind of industrial engine\ncapable of putting forth the energy of a hundred blast furnaces.\nThe design and construction took years, and the few he told about the\nproject laughed at the idea of any major improvement over what Mother\nhad already provided. In the end, though, he is successful.\nI've spent hours and hours reading the book - more time, I realized\nthen, than I spend with the Annals.\nThe\nnext day I met with Collus again during the Hour of Comfort.\nThis time he spoke hurriedly:\n\u201cIt\nwill be tonight. \u201d\n\u201cTonight!\nBut why so soon?\u201d\n\u201cA\nperfect opportunity. I have to work in the duct rooms, so I'll\nhave access to all of the Blocks. \u201d\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\u201cMother!\nI'll crawl through the ducts, of course! Prepare a kit - wear work\nclothing and bring the rest in a bundle, take any tools you may be\nissued. \u201d\n\u201cHow\nwill you open my cell door?\u201d\n\u201cI've\ngot a Block key. \u201d\n\u201cWhere\ndid you get that!?\u201d\n\u201cStole\nit from a Security Acolyte I found passed out from Herb in a\nmaintenance room once. He'll only be stripped of his position if\nhe's lucky. \u201d\nIt\nwould be unnecessary to describe the next four or five hours of\nanxiety as I worked through my afternoon labor and made the motions of\nworship at the Evening Congregation. It felt strange, to say the\nleast, to sing my praises to Mother while my mind was on Escape.\nI was made even more uneasy when the Holy Procession marched down the\nhall at the end; it felt to me as if the Priestess and all of her Holy\nAcolytes were looking at me as they passed\u2026 Did they know? The\npossibility began to tear through my mind that Collus had reported me\nto the Arbitrators, or that maybe he was one himself, one of the\nInvisible Eyes of Mother I had heard about in whispered rumors who\nseek out Heretics.\nFinally,\nas I was sitting in a corner of my cell, I heard the latch opening on\nthe door. It swung open, and there was Collus, wearing his work\nuniform and holding a huge pack.\n\u201cReady?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\nYes. \u201d\nWe\nclosed the door behind us and walked down the silent gray halls of the\nCell Block that I had walked a million times before, but with\ndifferent eyes, and then turned a corner onto the 14th broadpassage,\nwhere we walked for a ways past the rows and rows of cell doors - and\nevery time an Acolyte passed I was sure he would stop us and check our\nPasses - until we at last reached a\nmaintenance\npassage. It was unreal, knowing that in a few minutes we'd be at\nthe limits of Mother herself, with nothing between us and the dangers\nof Beyond.\nCollus\nopened the door and we entered the dimly lit hallway, smaller than the\nones of the Cell Blocks. I had been through these before on work\ndetails; once I had been blessed with the task of installing a new\niron base for some of the heating equipment, and had even been given\nmy very own assistant for the time of the work. But now we were\nleaving.\nWe\nclimbed through an air vent that Collus opened with one of the lock\nwrenches he had been issued for his labor, and while I had been\npresently surprised at my courage so far, the moment the vent latch\nopened I was hit with a burst of anxiety. What was I doing?\nWe\nfinally arrived at one of the small duct stations that connected the\nair passages of Blocks 80 through 100 of our Grid. On the wall\nin front of us was the large grating that Collus had told me about -\nthe one that he believed led to Outside.\nIt\ntook us a few minutes to remove the bolts from the frame and remove\nthe grating. Every time a belt fell to the floor making even the\nslightest noise, I was sure someone would hear and the Arbitrators\nwould arrive.\nThe\ngrating was removed, and with a last quick look around we both hopped\ninto the narrow vent and began crawling toward the end - wherever it\nwas. It was almost pitch dark, and as seconds turned into\nminutes without an end in sight, my apprehension began to multiply.\nBut\nafter perhaps 10 minutes, Collus suddenly stopped in front of me.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThere\nit is!\u201c he whispered excitedly.\n\u201cWhat\ndo you see?\u201d\n\u201cLight.\n\u201d\nWe\nstarted crawling again, and in a few moments I could indeed see some\nkind of light source over Collus' shoulders, which got bigger and\nbigger as we continued until I could make out that it was another\ngrating with the glow of a new and mysterious light gleaming through\nthe gaps.\n\u201cIs\nit the Outside?\u201d\n\u201cI\ndon't know\u2026\u201c But he couldn't hide the excitement in his voice.\nI knew.\nFinally,\nwe were there. Collus began to loosen the bolts as I tried to\nmake out the image distorted by the closely-spaced bars on the grating.\nBut I couldn't see - Collus was taking up most of the space in front\nof me as he feverishly labored to remove the metal barrier.\nAnd\nthen it came off. Collus gave it a violent shove and it was\nthrown forward into\u2026\n\u2026\ninto something I cannot begin to describe without difficulty.\nThe scene through the passage was full of colors - bright, lively\ncolors, half of it mostly green and the above half the color of rust.\nThere were raised areas in the distance, though how far I could not\ntell, towering above the rest of the Outside.\n\u201cWe've\ndone it,\u201c Collus said, almost in a whisper. \u201cNow we are free. \u201d\nAnd\nsuddenly the elation I had felt since we first saw the light fell\naway, and I was frightened beyond belief. Not of physical harm,\nthough the ground below us was more than a hundred feet and I still\nsuspected we might be caught even now.\nBut\nCollus didn't notice the shudder that ran through me.\n\u201cWe'll\nhave to climb down\u2026 there are things to hold onto, it should not be\nhard,\u201c he told me, smiling magnificently.\n\u201cYes.\n\u201d\nCollus\nturned around facing back inside and began to climb down the wall,\nwhich, as he said, seemed like a fairly easy thing to accomplish.\nI watched him as he slowly descended about 10 feet, then looked up and\ncalled for me to hurry. I just looked at him.\n\u201cWhat\nare you waiting for?\u201d he called to me.\nI\ncrawled backwards into the passage, turned away from the opening, and\nmade my way back to my cell.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050906051005\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/octdec2000\/faith.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"Would That It Were is proud to introduce the work of Barrett Brown.

Lord Covington was a\ngracious host, yet he left much to be desired when it came to measuring sugar.\nAs\nCovington rambled about his latest excursion to Africa, Alice's attention\nwandered to the tall arced window at the end of the room.\nIt looked out onto a garden, much like any other garden she had seen in\nher lifetime. Now, her mind drifted backward in time five years;\nher eyes grew heavy and the wave of the leaves took her away.\nEdward\nO'Brien had been in her garden that day, tall figure bent, his nose pressed into\na ruffled geranium. Alice had studied him for the longest time, finding the cut\nof his suit odd and the shine of his boots nonexistent. Was he lost? Had\nhe come to call on her younger sister? Alice\ndid not recognize him; he was no\none she had seen in London.\nWhen\nhe didn't leave, Alice had gone out to him.\nIf he needed assistance, she would give what she could.\nPerhaps he was looking for Covington.\n\"Sir?\"\nHe\nhadn't turned around; he continued\nsmelling the geranium, fingers brushing the broad leaves.\nAlice could imagine the smell of them, dusty and peppery, making her\nsneeze.\n\"Excuse\nme, sir?\"\nAgain, nothing. Alice was annoyed; what business did this man have in her garden and why wasn't he willing to share? Alice had taken another step toward him and had begun to reach for the sleeve of his jacket when he turned. His eyes were like vapor over a pond, then they settled into an ordinary brown. Alice blinked, certain she had imagined it.\n\"Madam,\ndo forgive me,\" he\nsaid, reaching for Alice's hand.\nThen\nhe stopped, holding her hand and staring in what Alice could only define as awe.\nHe turned her hand over and back again, fingers running over hers, then\nover the multitude of buttons that ran up her wrist and arm.\nHis fingers pressed at the gray material, wrinkles amassing at her wrist.\nOne button popped open, revealing pale skin.\n\"You're\nan odd construct,\" he said, looking up at Alice, who withdrew her hand and hid\nit behind her back.\n\"And\nyou, sir, are rude. What business\ndo you have in this garden?\"\n\"I\ncame to see the widow Templeton, but am I to understand she is no longer in\nresidence?\" He looked toward\nthe house in the distance. Alice\nlooked as well, seeing nothing remarkable in the red brick or the white\nshutters.\n\"The\nwidow Templeton lives a mile east of here, sir,\"\nAlice said as he went back to the flowers.\nA frown creased her brow and she followed.\n\"I can't understand how you mistook this place for hers. Her brick is ivory, while mine is red.\"\n\"The\ngarden,\" he said.\n\"There are so many here--I mistook your geraniums for hers, though\nyours are better tended.\" He\nlooked at Alice. \"Forgive my\nmanners. I'm Edward O'Brien.\"\nHe extended his hand, but Alice did not take it.\nHe withdrew the hand and turned back to the flowers.\n\"You\ndon't look or sound Irish,\" Alice\nsaid, following him as he walked along the flowerbed.\n\"I'm\nnot,\" Edward said with a wide\ngrin.\n\"What\ngame do you play, sir?\" Alice\nlooked toward the house; there was\nno sign of her sister. If they were\nlate to tea at the Bain's--\n\"No\ngame. I'm not Irish.\"\nHe stood up again from the flowers.\n\"I lived in Ireland for a time, though;\ntook my name from the people.\"\n\"Took\nyour name? Didn't your parents name\nyou upon your birth?\" A pain\nbegan to bloom in Alice's temple and she lifted a hand, pressing.\nEdward's eyes followed her hand, focusing on the buttons of her glove.\n\"They\ndid,\" he said, nodding,\n\"but it wasn't a proper name for this place.\"\n\"This\nplace?\" Alice looked around\nthe garden.\n\"Earth.\"\nAlice\nturned away from Edward. \"You\ncan find the widow Templeton on Cross Street, sir.\nGood day to you.\"\nShe\nwalked as quickly as could, but feared she might stumble when she reached the\ncourtyard. She drew in a breath and\nrealized she was shaking. When she\nlooked back to the garden, the man was gone.\nSo\nbegan her relationship with Edward O'Brien.\nTwo\nweeks later, Alice saw him again; he\nlingered beside a cherry tree, long fingers trailing over the leaves.\nThe gnarled trees made a rough border around the building.\nThough pretty in the spring, they stood like men in the winter, hunched\nand thin. Alice left her sister to\nthe church ladies. Edward's eyes lit up when he saw her.\n\"Looking\nfor the widow Templeton again?\" Alice\ngestured to the church steps. \"She's\nthere, with Father Brandenburg now.\"\n\"No,\nno,\" Edward said in a hushed\ntone. \"Not looking for her.\nCame to look upon these old trees.\"\n\"I\nasked her about you,\" Alice said, circling the tree to get a closer look at Edward.\nHis features were almost feminine, lashes long, nose straight, mouth\nfull. \"She said she didn't know any Edward O'Brien.\"\n\"Then\nyou have caught me in a lie.\" Edward\npressed a hand against his chest. \"It\nseems I am always asking your forgiveness.\nWould once more be too much?\"\n\"Yes,\nunless you explain yourself.\" Alice\nclutched her Bible in her hands, waiting. When\nEdward made no move to speak, she continued.\n\"You said you took your name, that the one your parents had given\nyou was not right for this place, meaning Earth.\nExplain yourself.\"\n\"I\nsaid all that?\" Edward\nwithdrew a handkerchief, patting at his brow.\n\"You\ndid.\"\n\"One\nwould think after all my time here, I would learn to hold my tongue in certain\nmatters. Miss--\nIt occurs to me that I don't know your name.\"\nAlice\nstraightened, determined not to give it to him.\nAt that exact moment, her sister bellowed.\n\"Alice!\nWe're leaving without you if you don't come directly!\"\n\"Alice,\"\nEdward said, making the name a sigh.\nAlice\nsaid nothing, turning and walking away from the trees, and Edward, and every\nquestion she wanted to ask. The man\nmade no sense; there was no reason\nto continue.\n\"I\nshall call on you, Alice,\" he\nsaid.\nAlice\nturned, but again, he had gone.\nTwo\ndays later, he came to call.\nSwathed\nin her veil-draped hat and thick gloves, Alice dipped her hand into the hive,\nbees swarming around her. She didn't know Edward was there until he cleared his throat.\nShe looked up at him, surprised at the way the bees seemed to be avoiding\nhim. He cut a path right through\ntheir saffron cloud and came to stand beside the hive.\nThe hum from the insects increased.\n\"You're\nfrightening them,\" Alice said, withdrawing a hunk of honeycomb.\n\"They don't know what you are.\"\nI don't know what you are, she thought, angry that she was attracted by\nthe mystery. She loved mysteries\nand now, she had a great one.\nEdward\nstepped back, letting Alice work. The\nbees calmed. She shoved the honeycomb into the jar she'd brought, brushing\nan errant bee on its way. Edward\nwas roaming the garden by this point. Alice\nset the jar of honeycomb aside, stripping her gloves off and brushing her veil\nback; retrieving the jar, she set\noff in search of Edward.\nShe\nfound him admiring a stand of lilac bushes, his nose buried in a large purple\nbunch of the flowers. Alice smiled,\namused by the sight of the large man enjoying the simple scent of a lilac.\n\"They\nare my favorites.\"\n\"I\ncan understand why,\" he said, moving along the line of bushes;\nhis hand brushed the leaves as he went.\n\"Walk with me, Alice?\"\nShe\nfell into step with him, sneaking glances at him as they went.\nHe was handsome, there was no denying that, but it was the mystery about\nhim that attracted her. Her sister\nand aunt had not heard of Edward O'Brien. He\nhad appeared out of nothingness, whole and mysterious.\n\"Who\nplanted this garden?\" he asked as they stepped onto the flagstone walk that led to\nthe goldfish pond.\n\"My\ngreat-great grandmother.\"\n\"Your\npeople have been here a long time then.\"\n\"Quite,\"\nAlice said. \"I suspect\nthe garden would have been planted earlier, but no one had the energy Margaret\nhad. How long have your people been\nhere?\" She should have been\nshocked by the question, that she had the courage to ask it, but Edward smiled.\n\"Longer\nthan that, Alice.\" He looked at her, eyes vapor, then normal.\n\"You are the first one I've told and the only one to see me slip for\neven a moment. My time here has\nbeen long, though I haven't done enough, seen enough.\"\nAlice\nlooked away from him, disturbed by the admission.\nShe didn't know what to make of it.\nHow could this man not be of this place, of Earth?\nShe watched Edward walk to the edge of the pond;\nhe kneeled and stroked his fingers across the surface of the water.\n\"What\nis that in your jar, Alice?\"\nShe\nlooked down at it, having forgotten she was holding it.\n\"Honey and comb,\" she\nsaid, holding it up to the light. It\nlooked like the comb was melting, honey running like liquid gold into the jar.\n\"Have\nyou ever had any?\" she asked. When\nhe shook his head, Alice removed the lid from the jar, breaking off a bit of the\nhoneycomb. She brought it to\nEdward, pressing it to his lips. His\nmouth opened and she popped it inside; his\neyes closed as he chewed. Alice\nwithdrew her hand, honey dribbling on her skirt, on the stones.\nAll around her, the air was alive; it\nseemed to vibrate with Edward's happiness.\nAlice\ncouldn't help but smile.\nTwo\nmore weeks passed. Alice was\nexiting the church when she spied Edward's coattails vanishing into the garden.\nSlipping away from the crowd on the lawn, Alice followed.\n\"Edward?\nAre you-- Oh!\"\nEdward's\nhands fell to Alice's cinched waist, pulling her backward, turning her to face\nhim. She smiled up at him as he\nhanded her a small package.\n\"You\ngave me the great gift of your honey,\"\nEdward said, \"and I thought to repay you.\"\nAlice\nlooked down at the box, shaking her head. \"That\nreally wasn't necessary.\" How\nwould she explain such a gift to her aunt?\n\"I can't--\"\n\"I've\nbeen here long enough to have seen women enjoying these things.\" Edward\ntook the box back, prying it open. Inside\nlay a delicate gold bracelet. He\npicked it up and held it out to Alice.\n\"My\nglove will have to come off,\" she\nsaid, shaking her head again. \"Edward.\"\nShe looked over her shoulder, but no one had followed.\nPalming\nthe bracelet, Edward stepped forward, grasping Alice's glove.\n\"I don't know how this works.\"\n\"The\nbuttons,\" Alice said as he\nextended her left arm. Edward's\nfinger ran over the long line of buttons and he nibbled his lip in\nconsideration.\nAs\nthe first button came open, Alice squeezed her eyes shut.\nThis wasn't proper. No man\nsave her husband should be unbuttoning her gloves, yet Alice felt the glove come\napart, button by button, and then felt Edward's fingers on her skin.\nShe opened her eyes to see the astonishment in his.\n\"Why\ndo you hide your hands?\" he\nasked, reaching for the fingers of the glove.\n\"They--\"\nLittle finger. \"Protect.\"\nRing finger. \"And keep\nme--\" Middle finger, index.\n\"Ladylike.\" Thumb.\nThe glove came away in a gray twist and Alice knew then how foolish they\nwere. Gloves did nothing but\nconfine.\nAlice\nstretched her fingers, Edward wrapping the bracelet around her wrist.\nWhen done, he stepped back, and smiled, pressing her glove to his nose.\nAlice flushed. \"Oh\nEdward, I--\" He stepped\nforward again.\nFinger\nby finger, he replaced her glove, pulling the fabric over her wrist and arm. \"No\none has to know.\"\nBut\nI will, Alice thought, feeling the line of the bracelet and the whisper of\nEdward's fingers as he fastened the glove, button by button.\n\"Why\ndo you always have to be so contrary, Alice?\nIt's an evening in the park; you\nenjoy those.\"\nAlice\nshook her head. \"Not\ntonight.\" She didn't need to\nlook up from her book to know her sister was wearing a frown that would have\nmade a man's knees weak. Anne\nOxbridge had a dozen suitors; Alice\nwished she would settle on one.\nAnne\nleft the study with a huff and Alice smiled, Anne's heels thundering on the\nmarble floors. She would be going\nto Cook now, telling her to unpack Alice's food from the picnic basket.\nAlice stretched out on the sofa, her book falling into her lap.\nShe\nclosed her eyes and listened as Anne made a noisy exit from the house, doors\nslamming. With her temper it was no\nwonder Anne hadn't received a proposal from her suitors.\nGood\nmarriages had been the only thing their parents had wanted for them.\nThough their parents were five-years dead, the wish clung;\ngood marriages to strong men who would support them for the rest of their\ndays. Anne saw nothing wrong with\nthat, though Alice didn't want to be supported.\nShe wanted to fly on her own.\nAlice\nfell asleep on the couch, waking when the moon was high and the sky\nstar-scattered. She closed her\nbook, wondering if Anne was home yet. The\nhouse was silent. Not even the\ngrandfather clock ticked. Alice\napproached it, frowning. The hands\nand pendulum were still.\nShe\nwalked through the darkened rooms. \"Anne?\" she\nasked, looking up the staircase. Silence\nreplied.\n\"Anne?\"\nHer voice trembled now and tried to tell herself she was being foolish,\nbut the air didn't feel right; it\nseemed as though someone would walk up at any moment and touch her shoulder.\nAlice\nturned, pressing her back to the banister.\nShe saw that the outer study door was open.\nShe moved from the foyer to the study, the rustle of her skirts breaking\nthe silence. Grasping the edge of the door, Alice realized with a moment\nof panic that anyone could have come inside.\nAnd\nthen, she saw Edward on the small porch off of the study.\nHe was leaning over the moon-splashed roses, smelling them.\nHad he opened the door?\n\"Edward?\"\nshe asked.\nHe\nturned and smiled, extending a hand to her.\n\"Alice, come enjoy the night with me.\"\nAlice\nlooked back over her shoulder, feeling as though every nerve in her body had\nbeen rubbed with ice. It was silent\nand cold in the house, though the outside air was warm and sweet.\nAlice went to Edward, placing her ungloved hand in his.\nIt\nhad been another two weeks since Edward had given her the bracelet.\nAlice smiled at the memory, but after that incident, he had vanished\nagain.\n\"Where\ndo you go when you aren't here?\" she\nasked as his bare fingers closed over hers.\nShe looked up into his dark eyes, starlight seeming to hang there.\n\"There\nis always somewhere to go,\" Edward\nsaid, \"something new to explore.\"\n\"Then\nwhy do you come back?\"\nEdward\nsmiled Alice's hand. \"Perhaps\nthat is the true question.\"\nHe\ntucked her hand into his bent arm and they walked off the porch, into the cool\ngrass. As Alice's skirts caught on\nthe rosebush, she turned, only then seeing the moths suspended in flight.\n\"Edward,\nwhat have you done?\" She\nreached out and touched them, but they didn't move;\ntheir wings were frozen silk.\n\"I've\ngiven us a piece of time, Alice.\" He\nsmiled and pulled her along. \"Come\non!\"\nHe\nlaughed and she followed, running as he ran, striving to keep up through the\nmoonlit garden. Edward was a dark\nshape ahead of her, the tails of his coat flying out behind him;\nAlice could have sworn that they weren't coattails at all, but wings--and\nmaybe they were.\nAlice\nfollowed, but began to tire; her breath caught in her throat and she slowed, calling for\nEdward to wait. He turned and in\none smooth motion, swept her into his arms, continuing their flight through the\ngardens.\nWidow\nTempleton's peonies burst apart as they rumbled through, a shower of pale pink\nand magenta petals whirling as if in a storm;\nLord Covington's daisies didn't stand a chance against the wind they\ncreated, \"he loves me, he loves me not\" seeming to echo in their wake.\nDelicate lilacs came apart, mixing with leaves, and rose petals, and the\never-present scent of tilled earth.\n\"We\ndon't have flowers on my world,\" Edward\nsaid later, plucking petals from Alice's hair.\nThey sat atop the pavilion in the park, looking at the still people\nbelow, at the fiery stars above. He\ncrushed a lilac bloom in his hand and inhaled.\n\"I wish that I could become flowers, that I could be this\nscent.\"\n\"No\nflowers,\" Alice whispered,\nleaning back against his chest. She\nshook her head, finding it impossible to imagine.\nWhat did they have then? Was\nhis world at all like Earth? \"Is\nthat why you came here?\"\n\"We\ncame to study everything,\" Edward\nsaid. \"For me, flowers were a bonus. You should see some of my companions--they are allergic to\neverything you can imagine. Flowers,\nfelines, everything.\"\nAlice\nsmiled. \"There are humans like\nthat as well.\"\n\"Perhaps\nwhy we blend so well.\" Edward\nbrushed a lock of Alice's hair back over her ear, separating a peony petal from\nthe simple hairpin she wore.\n\"Do\nyou stop time when you study things?\"\nshe asked. \"If you\nhave, I've no memory of it.\"\n\"We\nprefer studying your world in motion. This\nmoment is ours alone because I wished it so.\nThose of my kind still study.\"\nAlice\nturned in Edward's arms, her eyes searching his.\n\"How many of your kind are here?\"\nshe asked, fear skipping down her spine.\n\"Only\nfive. Six if you count me.\nWe're a small team. There\nare others throughout the galaxy, busy with other worlds.\"\nHis hand came up, seeming to brush against the sky.\n\"Other\nworlds.\" Alice looked up.\nShe had never considered there could be worlds other than this one, that\nthe stars were anything more than pretty light.\n\"That scares me,\" she\nwhispered. \"How many others?\nHow many studying us like bugs?\"\n\"Not\nbugs, Alice.\" He squeezed her\ncool hand. \"We just want to\nunderstand different creatures.\"\n\"Earth\nis nothing more than a jar you look into!\"\n\"No,\"\nEdward insisted. \"Alice--we\naren't supposed to interact with others and perhaps this is why.\nBut when I saw you in your garden with your gloves--and, oh, those\nbuttons. You captivated me,\nAlice.\"\n\"All\nthis time on Earth and you hadn't seen gloves?\"\n\"All\nthis time on Earth and I've not spoken with another human like this,\"\nhe said. \"We stay as\nseparate as we can. No one had\nconfronted me as you did. We learn\nfrom a distance, interacting only when we must.\"\nEdward squeezed Alice's hands. \"You\nwere different. I shouldn't have\nbeen caught in your garden, but there you were.\nI shouldn't have come back, but I did.\nAnd here we are.\"\nAlice\nlooked over the still people in the park. Somewhere\ndown there was her sister, perhaps frozen in a kiss with one of her many\nsuitors. Somewhere down there, a\nman had taken a bite of a sandwich and waited to swallow.\nThe entire world was draped in ice, until Edward freed it. The\npower terrified Alice.\nShe\nshook her head, looking back at Edward. \"You\nscare me, Edward,\" she said.\n\"Take me home.\"\nAnd\nso, he did.\nWinter\nerased autumn and Edward stayed away. Alice\ntook to her rooms, withdrawing from her sister and aunt.\nIce coated the trees and Alice wondered if Edward had snow on his world,\nor trees at all. Though he was not\nat her side, he occupied a great deal of her time.\nHad\nhe returned to his own world? Was he in the southern hemisphere studying the flowers there?\nWere those flowers like any she knew here?\nEdward's\nabilities scared her, but being alone was even more frightening.\nAlice realized she had lost a good friend.\nEdward had trusted in her to keep his secret, had told her things he\nhadn't told another human, and she had pushed him away.\nWhat\nwas it like, she wondered, to travel to another world, six alien people amid\nmillions of others? How difficult\nhad it been to stay apart from everyone except the other five with you?\nAnd how brave had Edward been to reach out to her at all?\nA\npounding on her door roused Alice from her thoughts.\n\"Alice!\" Anne called. \"There\nis a man at the door.\"\n\"Open\nit and ask what he wants,\" Alice\nsaid, closing her book, waiting for Anne to go away.\n\"I\nmean--he's lurking there, Alice, like a thief or something.\nHe hasn't rung the bell or called. I\nthink he's studying the wreath!\"\nAlice\nopened her door, looking at Anne's panicked features.\n\"I'll handle it,\" she\nsaid, brushing past Anne.\nAlice's\nheart seemed to be in her throat. She\nswallowed hard. A man studying the\nwreath. She reached for the\ndoorknob, then hesitated, peering out the leaded glass window beside the door.\nThe man was turned into a watery shape, nothing solid at all.\nAlice scowled and opened the door. Edward\nstumbled forward, his finger sliding along the wreath.\nHe bit out a word that Alice took for a curse, pushing him back to the\nporch as she came outside.\n\"What\nare you doing here?\" she asked, looking at Edward's hand. He had caught his finger on the holly wreath and was now\nbleeding. Alice pulled the\nhandkerchief from his coat pocket, wrapping it around his finger.\n\"Winter\nbrings its own share of mysteries,\" Edward\nsaid, breath fogging. \"What is\nthis?\" He reached out,\nplucking a red berry from the glossy green leaves.\n\"Holly,\"\nAlice said, knotting the handkerchief.\n\"But don't--\" Before\nshe could warn him, Edward had popped the berry into his mouth.\n\"They're poisonous--to humans.\"\n\"Delicious,\"\nEdward said.\n\"Why\ndid you come back?\" Alice's hands curled into the arm of his coat.\nThe air was cold and bit at her skin;\nshe wondered if he would like to come inside for tea.\n\"I\nlost a good friend,\" Edward said, his eyes warm and genuine, \"and I was hoping to find her again.\"\n\"Come\ninside.\" Alice tugged on his\narm, opening the door. \"We'll have tea and something to eat.\nSomething that isn't poisonous.\"\n\"With\nhoney?\" he asked as the door\nclosed behind them.\n\"...after\nall, I didn't want to fire and ruin the pelt.\nMiss Oxbridge?\"\nAlice\nlooked at Lord Covington, managing a smile.\n\"Whatever did you do?\" she\nasked as though she had been paying attention the entire time.\nAre there roses in China?\n\"Climbed\nup the tree and...\"\nHis\nwords faded again as Alice rose from her chair and went to the long table\nagainst the wall. She added more\ntea to her cup, the hot rush of fresh liquid dissolving the sugar that clung to\nthe bottom. What sort of gardens\nmust Egypt have?\nAlice\nsipped, looking at Covington's clock. It\nwas almost time to say goodbye. Behind\nher, Covington's laughter rumbled and Alice turned with a smile.\n\"You are the clever one.\"\nShe looked up at the lion's head above his fireplace.\nWhat birds had those eyes seen?\n\"When do you leave again?\"\n\"Soon. Africa calls, I must go.\"\n\"And\nso must I,\" Alice said,\nsetting her teacup down. \"Anne\nand I have plans this evening.\"\nA\nsmile spread across Covington's weathered face and he kissed Alice's cheeks\nbefore letting her go. \"A\nbeautiful spring evening should be spent with your beau.\"\n\"He's\nnot my beau,\" Alice said,\nthough it was a tired argument. Half the town believed she and Edward had secretly married.\nShe\nleft Covington's home and headed for her garden, which had only grown more\nbeautiful over the past five years. Edward had helped tend the flowers and trees and loved\nspending time feeding the goldfish. He\nstayed away from the bees, but Alice gave him honeycomb whenever she came from\nthe hives.\nAbove\nher, thunder rumbled and Alice felt the first touch of raindrops.\nShe hurried through the garden, picking flowers as she went.\nAlice felt as though her hands were overflowing, but still that it would\nnever be enough.\nShe\nfound Edward where she had met him, bending over a geranium.\nEdward breathed, never removing his nose from the flower and Alice\nsmiled.\n\"Sir?\"\nshe asked, much as she had on that first day.\nHe didn't turn her way. \"Excuse\nme, sir?\"\nNow,\nEdward turned and Alice shivered when she looked into his vapory eyes.\nThey were like mist over a lake, calm and still, somehow soothing.\nHe blinked, but the reality didn't fade and for that, Alice was thankful.\nDid he have wings tucked under his coat?\nWere his clothes real at all? There\nwere too many questions left unanswered--he couldn't possibly leave.\n\"Edward,\"\nshe said, her voice breaking. \"I\ndon't even know your real name.\" She\nblinked tears away. \"Oh, I\npromised I wouldn't cry.\"\nEdward\nclosed the distance between them, wiping her tears away.\n\"I've got to go, Alice. There\nare so many things to see.\"\n\"Will\nyou come back?\" she asked,\nafraid now of the answer.\n\"I\nalways do,\" Edward said with a\ngrin, kissing Alice's cheek. A\npoppy fell from her grip and he bent to pick it up, smelling the orange bloom.\n\"You\ndon't even have flowers where you're going.\"\nAlice pressed all she held into Edward's arms, making him look like he'd\ncaught a bridal bouquet.\nEdward\ntossed the flowers into the air and as Alice watched, time stopped.\nEdward coated each petal and stem in ice, shaping them into a ball which\nhe placed in his pocket. \"Now\nI do,\" he said, brushing a\nkiss over Alice's cheek. He smelled\nlike peppery geraniums and Alice sneezed against his lapel.\nEdward\nleft without saying goodbye, rushing headlong into the gardens, coattails\nblurring into wings. Alice wanted to move, but she felt rooted;\nlilac petals clung to her dress, and she remembered the night five years\nago when Edward had taken them from her hair;\ndaisy pollen coated her fingers, and \"he loves me, he loves me\nnot\" echoed all around her.\nAlice\ncould feel the air tingling with his happiness and she turned in a wide circle,\nstretching her hands to the sky. When\nshe stopped, Edward had vanished, but the world around her seemed to keep\nmoving.\nThis\nwas what Edward relished, and Covington when he traveled.\nThis was what made them feel alive and frightened in the same instant;\nthe endless possibility that lay beyond the walls of this garden and so\nmany others.\nThe\nimages she had seen in books were more than flat photographs;\nthose places existed in a hundred shades of color, not in sepia, black,\nand white. Somewhere, someone like\nEdward smelled foreign flowers, perhaps standing knee-deep in mossy water do to\nso. Women with bare hands worked\nthe earth, feeding and nurturing it so more flowers would come. Dirt under nails, hands browned by the sun, trousers soaked\nwith mossy water.\n\"Take it button by button, Alice,\" she said. She had stayed in this place all her life, but it was time to breach the garden walls. There were, after all, so many things to see.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050421124105\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/aprjun2001\/buttonbybutton.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The Internet's Premier Magazine of Historical Science Fiction","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/glHTwhbUXAUAoDT7nSl5Q-8NvMY.json","volume":2.0,"issues":2.0,"has_text":true}

Your Attention Please!\"\nThe passengers looked nervously at each other then toward\nthe speaker in the ceiling as the violent shaking of the craft\nincreased. \"SecondLook PastVentures is experiencing unexpected\ndifficulties. Please maintain your group in a calm manner.\"\n\"Benjamin,\ntell me this isn't happening. Not on our first vacation\nto the past.\" Sara grabbed his arm and squeezed so\nhard he nearly cried out. Her other arm encircled their\ntwo-year-old daughter protectively. \"You said this\nwould be safe!\"\n\"It's\nall right. I've never heard of a problem in the eight years\nof public traveling. Probably just a time-sync bounce.\"\nThe ability to sound unexcited surprised him. If Sara felt\nhis pulse or put her hand on his chest, she would feel his\nheart hammering against his ribs. It felt like everyone\nwithin ten meters should be hearing the thudding.\nThe\ncraft shuddered, dropped for undetermined amount of time,\nthen shook like a dog drenched in water.\n\"Your\nAttention!\" The unseen voice spoke calmly. \"Because\nof technical problems beyond our control, we are evacuating\nall groups to their predetermined time positions. Check\nyour message receiver now, in the group leader's control\ncenter. Instructions are now being encrypted to inform you\non returning by SecondLook Extraction. Standby...emergency\ndeparture in ten...nine...eight\n\"\nSara\nfrantically tied the bag of their time-coordinated issued\nbelongings to her waist and gripped Sophia's hand.\nBenjamin\ntook the power book message from the receiver and stuck\nit inside his coat pocket. \"Stay put when we enter.\"\nHe whispered to Sara.\n\"Prepare\nto disembark, prepare to disembark. Three...two...one...1872\nGo!\"\nBenjamin\nand Sara felt like they fell into a vacuum with the roar\nof a howling wind, and then they plunged down a dark shaft\nof glittering diamonds ending with them huddled together\nin a small clearing of trees. Rain came down in sheets,\nlightning cracked and thunder rumbled from behind the black\nclouds. It was night .\n\"Sara,\nSophia! Are you all right?\" Benjamin had to shout to\nbe heard.\n\"We\ncan't see anything! What's happening?\" Sara yelled\nback.\n\"Hold\non. Our sight will be back in a moment. This is common.\"\nThe\nfirst things he saw when his eyes focused were the treetops\nbending from the storm. Sara was huddled over Sophia, her\nback to the downpour. Benjamin took both their hands and\nfled into a deep grove of thick oak trees. Together, the\nthree cowered behind a huge tree trunk that formed a shelter\nof sorts with several large boulders.\n\"Crawl\nunder the rocks. We'll wait here for the storm to end. Can\nyou see yet?\"\n\"Yes,\nit just returned. Where are we?\"\n\"I\ndon't know. We should have been time-jumped to Boston. That's\nwhere our vacation itinerary indicated we were to go.\"\nBenjamin\ncouldn't believe he slept. His coat covered Sophia, and\nSara was snuggled against him. The storm was over; rain\ndrops dripped from the leaves of the tree branches and the\nsun chased the chill away. In every direction he looked,\ngreen trees and grass grew abundantly. A vast, pristine\nland. It certainly wasn't the preserved museum pieces of\na past time. Both Benjamin and Sara had seen all twenty\nof the forests protected by glass walls.\nWhen\nthe opportunity came to actually see forests covering thousands\nof square miles, before man developed their mega-cities,\nthe Briggs jumped at the chance. SecondLook PastVentures\nwould supply them with clothing, money and tutorials of\nthe era, then put them in the year of their choice for one\nmonth.\nComing\ndown a dirt road past the trees, Benjamin saw a man driving\na wagon being pulled by four, stout horses.\n\"Stop!\nPlease.\" Benjamin waved his arms, palms open to show\nhe had no weapon.\n\"And\nwhat are ye doing on the road, friend?\" The dialect\nwas of old New England.\n\"We\nwere lost in the storm. My wife and daughter are in the\ngrove. Would you take us to a city?\"\n\"A\ncity? I happen to be on my way to New York. Is that city\nenough?\" He motioned to climb in the wagon. \"Get\nyour family.\"\n\"Thank\nyou, sir.\" Benjamin, Sophia and Sara climbed into the\nwagon and rode to New York City.\n\"I\nseem to be a bit foggy, what's the date?\" Benjamin\nhoped they were in the right era.\n\"The\ndate? October 27th.\"\n\"What\nyear?\"\n\"Are\nyou daft, man? 1872, in the year of our Lord.\" The\nwagon driver looked at Benjamin with disbelief. He shook\nhis head.\nThey\nwere let off near the waterfront. Benjamin secured a room\nin the Sailor's Boarding House.\nAs\nhe sat on the bed, he pulled the message receiver out of\nhis coat pocket and activated it. The message flashed in\nwhite letters on a black background: We must receive a visual\nsignal within thirty (30) days from activation, visible\nfrom the location of longitude 52 degrees north and latitude\nof 28 minutes northwest within one hour of 1600 GMT. Upon\nreceiving said visual signal, persons shall be retrieved\nby SecondLook. Please release message receiver, destruction\nin one minute. The signal must contain at least two colors\nof the spectrum.\nBenjamin\nmemorized the coordinates then placed the receiver in the\nwashbasin. He watched as it shrunk into nothingness.\n\"Why\ncan't they just come and pick us up?\" Sara asked, worry\netched on her face.\n\"Because\nwe were inserted out of time-sync. According to the class,\nif you remember, we would have traveled down a time warp\nramp to Boston, on August 22, 1872. I guess whatever problems\nthey had made them just dump us. No special month or day.\nThat's how we ended up outside of New York Since we can't\nhave any type of items not indigenous to the time era, there's\nno way of tracking us except by pre-determined coordinates.\nAll the receiver did was transmit a time-warp signal, and\nI guess it's the only thing allowed. But only for twenty-four\nhours.\"\nWith\na forced grin, he told them to enjoy their stay and he'd\ncheck into seeing where the rendezvous would be.\nThe first things he bought were a Farmer's Almanac and a\nnautical map. With Sara and Sophia by his side, sitting\non the bed in their room, he mapped out the coordinates.\n\"God, it's in the middle of the ocean. How the hell\ncan we be there on the 25th?\"\nEveryday\nfor a week, Benjamin frequented the saloons and eateries,\nasking questions of sailors and merchants in regards to\nweather conditions and availability of ships.\nInside the Boar's Tavern, Benjamin ordered a stein of ale\nand sat down at a table. He was exhausted from worry and\nconcern they couldn't make the rendezvous point.\n\"Is\nthat Benjamin Briggs?\" A rough voice called from across\nthe room.\nBenjamin's\nhead snapped around to face the speaker. \"My God, Albert!\"\nThe chair fell over as he leaped to his feet. The patrons\nlooked in wonder as eight men hugged and slapped each other\non the backs.\n\"What\nin the hell are you guys doing here?\"\n\"We\nwere dumped in New Jersey three weeks ago.\" Albert\nsaid with a rush. \"After we got our coordinates, we\ncame here to find a ship. They expect us to be between the\nAzores and Portugal on the 25th of November. I think we're\ngoing to have to steal one, except none of us knows how\nto sail.\"\n\"I\ncan sail. The top of my class, 2062. All done through simulation,\nbut its all the same.\" Benjamin checked the map with\nhis and Albert's figures. \"Identical extraction point.\nWe get picked up together. Let's have another mug of ale\nand plan this out. How much money do we have, all told?\"\nWhen he entered the room, Sophia slept on the bed and Sara\nrushed into his arms. She looked into his eyes questioningly.\n\"Have you discovered something? You look excited.\"\n\"You'll\nnever guess. I met Albert Richardson who was also in our\n1872 time-sync group; he's with six other men who were evacuated\nfrom the SecondLook. We pooled our money and bought a 103ft\nsail boat,\" he said proudly. \"I forged some papers\nshowing I was an experienced sea captain, then I secured\na consignment of 1700 barrels of alcohol and wrought-iron\nwire to deliver to Italy. You can't believe it. Merchants\nare desperate to have their goods shipped to different countries.\nWe leave on the 7th of next month.\" His blue eyes nearly\nsparkled from the excitement.\n\"But\nhow will we get rescued?\"\n\"I've\nthought of a way, and I think it will work. If it does,\nwe'll be rescued, if not, we live the rest of our lives\nwaiting for SecondLook to try to find us.\" His brows\nfurrowed and he frowned. \"So much of this depends on\nthe accuracy of the almanac. It's predicting a lightning\nstorm on the 25th.\"\n\"A\nlightning storm! Benjamin, we can't be on the ocean with\nSophie during a storm. We'll die!\"\n\"Trust\nme Sara, it's our only hope.\"\nThe\ngroup of eight men, one woman and a three-year-old child\nleft the New York harbor on the morning of November 7, 1872.\nWith directions from Benjamin, they heaved the sails and\nwere soon heading toward Genoa, Italy.\nThe\nmen accomplished two things on the days of riding the sea.\nThey secured nine barrels of alcohol in the lifeboat being\npulled behind them, then wrapped a roll of wrought-iron\nwire to the mast of the lifeboat, fifteen feet of naked\nwire sticking above it and the end hovering over the barrels.\nOn\nthe afternoon of November 25th, the storm hit. The wind\nhowled, waves crashed over the bow, and lightning split\nthe seas.\n\"Sara,\ntie yourself and Sophie to the masthead.\" Benjamin\nyelled over the roar of the storm. \"Albert, raise the\njib, we've got to hold into the wind. Stay our position!\"\nHe lashed the wheel with a rope and called to the other\nmen. \"It's nearly time, start the fire under the barrels\nand tether the lifeboat at least ten meters from us.\"\nAs\nthe lifeboat rode the swells, the barrels of alcohol boiled\nfrom the fire, vapor clung like fog over the boat. The crew\nand Benjamin had tied themselves to the mast with Sara and\nSophie.\n\"All\nwe can do is pray.\" Benjamin murmured, his arms around\nhis wife and daughter.\nDespair\ngripped his heart as the liquid in the barrels boiled away.\nA mighty crack of lightning hit the wire above the mast\nand traveled down in a flurry of snapping, angry, sparks,\nending at the bottom of the wire which was saturated with\nthe fumes from the alcohol. . The explosion caused the ship\nto heel violently and a fireball rose high into the air,\nthe flame a bright yellow and red. Everybody watched in\na stunned silence.\nAn\nice blue, cold tunnel enveloped them. \"Untie yourselves,\nlet's go.\" Benjamin shouted as he pulled the ropes\nfrom Sara and Sophie. In two's they ran up the time-warp\nramp in the tunnel, Benjamin carrying Sophie.\n\"SecondLook\nis pleased to announce we have successfully completed our\ncontract. Please be seated, we will be returning to time-sync\nmomentarily.\"\nOn December 4th, 1872, the Mary Celeste was found drifting\naimlessly between Portugal and the Azores. She was sea-worthy,\nhad a supply of food and water and her cargo was intact,\nwith the exception of nine barrels of alcohol and a roll\nof wrought-iron wire missing. There was no reason for the\nship to be deserted. Nonetheless, sometime on the 25th of\nNovember 1872, Captain Briggs, his wife, their daughter,\nand the seven-strong crew had indeed abandoned ship. They\nwere never to be seen again.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20051030133631\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/janmar2003\/homewardbound.htm","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/2o50nxMUelv5hfRs3uxPug17tbE.json","volume":4.0,"issues":1.0,"has_text":true}

We would\nsit for hours, playing poker and musing on world events at\nO'Reilly's Pub down in Old San Francisco's Warf District.\nHe would often tell me this after making some outrageous bet,\nand then laying down a perfect royal flush, seemingly pulling\nthe right cards out of thin air. Now, it was a good thing\nthat Carlisle and I were friends, or I would have shot him\nfor cheating. Astonishingly, the more he would talk about\npredictability and Nature's Order, the more I came to accept\nhis sanity, clarity of judgment, and insight.\nOne Saturday afternoon, over a few glasses of stout gin and\ntonic, I got the nerve to challenge Carlisle a little more\nthan usual. He was sipping his drink calmly, peering through\nhis wire-rimmed lenses at the noisy, tobacco-choked crowd\nmilling past the brass rail.\n\"Tell me, John, how do you do it? What gives you this\ncertainty in prediction, this belief in the future?\"\nCarlisle turned his attention from some ruffians arguing about\na bar tab to me, and smiled wryly. He fumbled in his pocket\nfor a minute, and without saying a word, pulled a device from\nhis coat.\n\"This, this is my certainty,\" said Carlisle. \"Take\na look at it, closely if you'd like. Pick it up.\" At\nhis command, I gingerly grasped this machine and examined\nit. It was a silver and brass box, in shape not dissimilar\nto a cigar box, though slightly smaller. On the top were a\nfew dials, a gauge or two with some numbers, and a switch.\nRotating the box in my hand, I noticed it to be unevenly heavy;\nits left side pulled toward the table much more than its right.\nIntrigued, I set the device back on the table between us.\n\"What does this do?\" I asked.\n\"I've been doing some studies,\" Carlisle said. \"Have\nyou ever heard of a certain Presbyterian minister, from the\ncentury before ours, named Bayes?\"\n\"Yes,\" I answered. \"Something to do with statistics,\nthough mathematics were never my strong point at the university.\"\n\"Probability,\" corrected Carlisle. \"Conditional\nprobability. Bayes's theorem shows us how the likelihood of\none event can be conditioned on another.\"\n\"Go on,\" I urged him. I decided to light a cigar;\nthis might take a while.\n\"I have been working with Bayes's ideas, and taken it\na step further. In my calculations, I've found a way to predict\nthe order of events, and in so doing, to order them.\"\nWith that statement, he flicked the switch on top of the mysterious\nbox. It started to hum, as with a flow of electricity from\nsome unseen source. He then took a small, white card from\nhis wallet, scribbled something illegible on it, and slipped\nit into the machine's side slot. The whirring got louder,\nand the table itself, while not large, began to take on a\ncertain animated quality.\n\"What would you say were your chances of marrying Helen?\"\nhe asked me. Helen was a mutual friend, a neighbor's boarder\nfrom Boston. She was a slender, red-haired beauty, Irish in\ntemperament, with shockingly intense green eyes. Though we\noften chatted politely, I lacked the confidence to seek to\nknow her more intimately.\n\"Helen? Why, little or none,\" I answered, feeling\nmy face turn warm.\n\"You're wrong, sir, quite wrong,\" Carlisle said,\npulling the white card back out of the machine. \"I predict\nthat you shall marry the fair young Helen, and soon enough.\"\nHe read the card carefully, and then tucked it away in his\npocket. \"You have to set the circumstances in motion,\nthough. Go to Chinatown, and seek out a certain apothecary,\na Mr. Zhan.\"\nSomehow at a loss for words at this intrusion into my personal\naffairs, I took my leave of Carlisle then. Quickly rising\nfrom my seat, I bade him adieu and scurried off into the dusty\nSan Francisco streets towards home. That night, as the moonlight\nglimmered through the half-open curtain of my bedroom window,\nI lay in a state between wakefulness and sleep. As the hours\ncrept by, I drowsily counted the shadows of leaves and branches\nas they slid across the ceiling. I imagined the shadowy figures\nof Helen and myself together, walking hand in hand down a\ncountry lane. Turning Carlisle's device over and over in my\nmind, I attempted to resolve the mystery of its inner mechanism.\nSo much was unexplained, and moreover unexplainable. It came\ndown to a matter of trust, of a depth of faith I was unaccustomed\nto placing in the likeness of a mortal man.\nAfter three more days of restlessness, I mustered the courage\nto find this apothecary, and roamed the bustling streets of\nChinatown. In a small corner shop that smelled of jasmine,\nginger and moldy leaves, I found the elderly, wan Mr. Zhan\nhobbling behind an ornate brass counter.\n\"May I help you find something, sir?\" inquired Zhan,\nwith a wry gleam in his eyes. When I introduced myself, an\nimmediate look of recognition flashed across his wrinkled\nface.\n\"You are a friend of Mr. Carlisle,\" he stated. \"I\nhave this for you.\" From under the counter he pulled\nout a gold and brown stick-figure dragon, a type of Chinese\nartifact known as a root sculpture. Some ancient artist had\ncarved lions and demons into the gnarled wood.\n\"Life is like this dragon,\" said the old man. \"There\nare many parts to the body, but only one head. Many paths,\nbut only one destination. Take this and go home.\" I offered\nto pay Mr. Zhan, but he refused any compensation. So I tucked\nthe small dragon under my coat and proceeded homeward. It\nweighed less than a pound, and was not a burden to carry.\nYet as I walked the streets with it wrapped in the folds of\nmy coat, the dragon grew ever warmer, and pulsed with an unnatural\nliving energy. The closer I approached to my home, the greater\nthe heat and throbbing of the small statue. Noisy and chaotic\nconstruction blocked my customary route, so I followed a wooden\nwalkway up a nearby hill. Along the way through the business\ndistrict, I heard a commotion at the next street corner. A\nrunaway carriage was careening toward a group of shoppers.\n\"Look out!\" I screamed as I dashed instinctively\ninto the crowd, pushing a well dressed pedestrian out of the\nway. The carriage caromed down the street further, slamming\nanother empty one, parked on the side of the road. \"Miss,\nare you all right?\" I asked, panting for breath. Only\nthen did I recognize a certain curl of red tresses over a\nlace collar.\n\"Why, yes sir, I am!\" said Helen. \"Thank you\nso much!\" Though we were both shaken, we struck up and\nimmediate conversation and walked home together. Then I began\nto see Carlisle's insight. Had I not taken a detour to visit\nthe ancient Chinese medicine man, I would have never seen\nHelen, nor had the opportunity to save her from near certain\ninjury. Helen and I preserved the Asian dragon on our parlor\ntable a souvenir for many years to come.\nSoon after this incident, I was sent off to cover the war\nin Cuba. Carlisle and I didn't see each other for years. When\nI returned from the war and sought him out at O'Reilly's,\nhis usual spot at the near-corner table was empty. Months\npassed before I could share with him the wonderful news, that\nHelen and I had wed, and she was expecting our first child.\nThen one hot July day, while entering the lobby of my bank,\nI noticed a tall, sturdy fellow, with salt-and-pepper hair\nand wire glasses at a desk, signing some papers. I immediately\nrecognized the figure as Carlisle. He was well dressed, in\nthe latest French fashion.\n\"John!\" I said, walking over to shake his hand.\n\"How have you been?\"\nLooking up from a pile of bank notes and checks, Carlisle\ngreeted me cheerfully. After exchanging pleasantries, we agreed\nto meet at an exclusive restaurant that evening, to discuss\nour fortunes. A fine porterhouse steak and a ruby-red Chianti\nare always conducive to the renewal of a friendship.\n\"What,\" Carlisle inquired between bites of steak,\n\"have you been doing these last few years?\" With\nthat query, I told him about my life as a journalist for the\nChronicle, and my marriage to Helen. I reminded him of his\nastonishing prediction and the mysterious device he had shown\nme at our last meeting.\n\"I told you,\" said Carlisle, \"about these probabilities,\nand the interactions of events. Are you certain,\" he\nsaid with a grin, \"that the runaway carriage would have\never broken loose, had you not been at the right spot to save\nHelen? Since we used to have those poker games at O'Reilly's,\nI have taken my investigations much further, and with my probability\ncalculator, I have begun to explore the highest ranges of\npossibility.\"\nWith that introduction, Carlisle told me a story of his increasing\nwealth, and how he had used his formulas, and his machine,\nto benefit from progress. The wealth of the Vanderbilts and\nAstors was not beyond his reach. And he had traveled extensively,\nthrough India, Russia and Europe.\n\"I'm exceedingly wealthy now, my friend,\" he told\nme smugly. \"Oil, electricity, and gold: these are the\nroads to fortune these days.\" He explained to me how\nhis device, through a mechanism of electrically operated gears\nand motors, helped him calculate both improbable events-and\nrule them out-and probable events. \"Singling out the\nmost likely is a matter of removing the least likely,\"\nhe assured me. \"And my biggest discovery: whatever is\nleft, after removing the unlikely, is not only likely, but\nreal.\"\nThrough manipulating a chain of events, Carlisle was able\nto not only make predictions about the future, but to affect\nit. \"I can help you do the same,\" he promised me.\nHanding me a piece of paper with some rather large numbers\non it, he said, \"Tomorrow, buy this amount of stock in\nGeneral Electric and Standard Oil. Hold them for 10 days,\nand then sell.\"\nI by now trusted Carlisle's word implicitly, and rushed the\nnext day to the stock exchange and bought the precise quantity\nof stock he had recommended. In 10 days, I sold, gaining some\n$14,000 in the transaction. The day after, the stock market\nlost millions. And the week after that, even more shocking\nnews: \"McKinley Assassinated!\" screamed the headlines.\nIn my days at the newspaper I would see Carlisle's name pop\nup occasionally. \"American Millionaire Consults German\nChancellor,\" read one headline. Another described his\npurchase of a chemical factory outside Bonn, and still a third\nhis investment in a British shipyard. I wanted to follow his\nlife story more closely, but distance and events always prevented\nus from close communication. Years later, when I next saw\nCarlisle, he looked tired, though still richly adorned in\nsilk shirts and finely tailored jackets. We were at a conference\nof railroad and telegraphy executives in Boston. New wrinkles\nspidered gently around his cheeks, and his hair cascaded in\ngray, uncombed waves around his shoulders. He looked like\na man losing touch with reality.\n\"Are you all right, John?\" I asked.\n\"It's\nit's the machine,\" he said. \"There\nare consequences, consequences to everything.\" With that,\nhe began shoving his way through the posh crowd toward the\nmarble-cased exit. I followed after him, curious. \"I'm\noff to Liverpool,\" he said. \"I can't tell you much\nmore, but be sure to watch the headlines.\" I was frustrated\nby my friend's newfound lack of constancy; this frantic persona\nhe donned was new and unsettling. And also, I was anxious\nto learn more of his machine, his calculations and his predictions.\nTwo months later, I received a package in the mail, postmarked\nLondon. When I opened the package, I found a small, leather-bound\njournal, and a letter. I hastily opened the letter, which\nI gathered to be from Carlisle.\n\"My Dear Friend,\" the letter began. \"I send\nyou this journal of my scientific endeavors. I recorded here\nall that led me my present state. I trust you shall keep it\nsafe.\"\nI opened the journal and flipped through the pages, reading\nbits here and there. Although I understood little of the mathematics,\nI followed the story of Carlisle's work. How the machine I\nhad seen was but a prototype of a larger, more complex one\nhe had built at his English countryside estate with his immense\nnewfound riches. Each of his successes in prognostication\nwas documented, as were the consequences of these acts.\nDuring the quiet early years of the 20th century, Carlisle\nseemed to drop out of existence. There were no more headlines,\neven as the wheels of progress seemed to turn faster and faster\ninto our new, enlightened age of Progress. Engaged as I was\nwith my growing family, and my successful journalism career,\nI lost track of him. His journal, ever an object of my curiosity,\nremained securely on a shelf in my study.\nThen one spring morning, as I was taking my morning coffee,\nI heard some shouting and a loud \"THUMP! THUMP!\"\nat the entrance to the parlor. Wondering at the commotion,\nI rushed to the front door ahead of Mrs. Stevens, our housekeeper.\nPulling the door open, half ready to throttle the noisome\nintruder, I was confronted with a gaunt, skeleton of a man,\ndressed in black from head to toe.\n\"Sir, what do you want?\" I enquired.\n\"Friend, friend it is I!\" said the stranger. It\nwas only then, at the somber timbre of his voice, that I recognized\nCarlisle, or I should say, the near ghost of Carlisle.\nWe sat down in the drawing room and talked. I offered him\ntea, but he refused it. He was frantic.\n\"You must get out,\" he said. \"Leave San Francisco\nnow.\"\n\"But, why?\" I demanded.\n\"It's gotten completely out of hand,\" he said. \"Something\nbad is coming, and I've been working to avoid it. But I've\nonly made matters worse.\"\nHe then explained to me the interrelatedness of the Panama\nCanal, the Spanish War, McKinley's assassination, and the\nrise of new forms of power and wealth.\n\"I've invested in markets, bought and sold companies\nand men. Politics can be manipulated, and so can the forces\nof Nature. When one such as I pushes the forces of time in\nways of his own desire, they bend, bow and break in ways too\ncomplex for me to foresee completely.\"\n\"I'm\nI'm sorry,\" I said. \"But I just\ncannot justify leaving my home based on what you've told me.\"\n\"I've seen a great war coming,\" he told me. \"Many\nof my own actions have led to it. But now, I have taken steps\nto bring an end to it. My calculation device shows me the\nproper paths to take. Certain European princes must be paid\nand certain must die, else we all shall. But you must take\nHelen and your children and flee the city now!\"\n\"Sir, though I have always given you my trust and friendship,\nI cannot comprehend what you tell me today,\" I said.\n\"I will stay here with my family.\"\n\"Foolishness! All foolishness!\" he said, thrusting\nhimself up from his seat and pacing my oaken floor. \"Nature\nwill have its way! Where is my journal?\"\nShaken by his remonstrations, I pulled the journal off my\nbookshelf and dropped it into his open hands. Saying hardly\na word, Carlisle pounded out the front door of my house and\nscurried off into the hazy street. I tried to put the rest\nof this out of my mind, till the next morning, when I was\nthrown out of bed and in a flash our house crashed to the\nground. Helen, the children and I narrowly escaped into the\nrubble-strewn street with our lives. I never saw Carlisle\nagain, nor do I know the results of all his experiments\n.\nIf war one day comes, then this vast city will have paid the\nprice for nothing.\nThe\nEnd","source":"http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20051030150806\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/aprjun2003\/probability.htm","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/iUSUvpx6kWHx5kJ5wuTaycnvU5A.json","volume":4.0,"issues":2.0,"has_text":true}

One\nhand held the gift; the other was lifted to knock on the door.\nHe paused and breathed deeply, the cinnamon smell of fall leaves\nfilling his lungs, forcing out the last of the metallic air from a thousand\nyears hence.

An inrush of\nair seemed to pull at the traveler, making him teeter forward ever so\nslightly.\n\"Damn\nit! There's no call for incessant\nbanging and crashing on my door. If\nyou're storming the house then fire cannon, but don't break down my door with\nyour fist; it will take a great while on your part, longer than I can stand to\nwait!\" White haired, white suited, and mustached, he was just as the\ntraveler remembered from the ancient pictures.\nThere was even a 'cigar' in his mouth, smoke curling upward in the\nautumn afternoon.\nThe\ntraveler froze.\n\"I...uh...Mark...uh..Sam...that\nis Mr. Clemens...Mr. Twain...I'm sorry...I.\"\nMark\nTwain squinted and looked at the time traveler.\nHe\ntook in the traveler's platinum suit; rainbow colors shifting in patterns, the\nlattice of crystal that held the gift; light dancing throughout....and swore.\n\"Hellfire\nand damnation! Another one.\" Then\nloudly, over his shoulder into the house.\n\"Livy! There's\nanother one of those damnable people from the future at the door.\"\nThen, to the traveler. \"Well,\ndon't just stand there. I suppose\nyou have something important to say.

Delicate,\nfragile, a strong wind or a harsh word might send her whirling out the window\ninto the sky.\n\"So\nkind of you to come. I don't suppose you could tell us how far you have\ncome?\" Her voice was a sea\nbreeze,\na\nlight touch of mist.\n\"An\nhour...no...I'm sorry, a thousand years.\nA thousand years from now.\"\n\"How\nnice.\"\n\"Yes...uh...nice\"\n\"Do sit down, Mr...\" She paused, the question hanging in the air.\n\"We\nhave no names.

Two or three came\nto help me retain the Wide West mine I owned and let slip away.\nOne fellow nearly had me riding with General Custer to the Little Big\nHorn after bothering me quite a bit at the U.S. Centennial in New York.\"\nTwain rolled the cigar around his mouth and puffed quietly for a\nmoment. \"A good half dozen\npop in whenever Halley's Comet passes through their time.\nIt's gotten so I can't swing a cat without hitting a time\ntraveler.\" Twain chuckled.\n\"With apologies to the cat.\"\nThe\ntraveler, still overwhelmed, tried to speak.\n\"I...uh...came to tell you...to ask you.\"\nTwain,\nhands in both pockets, laughed. \"Of course you did.\" He began pacing around the traveler. \"You'll tell me about books I have yet to write, the\ndate and time of my death, the loss of my family.\" He chewed contemplatively on the cigar for a moment.\n\"Then you'll go on about global wars, bombs big enough to blow up\nthe planet, men walking on the moon, curing disease, rockets to Mars and\nbeyond, earthquakes in California, Volcanoes in Missouri, floods, famine,\netcetera, etcetera.\" He knocked ash from the end of the cigar with a deft flick of\nthe fingers. \"Pretty much\nwhat everybody has to say, isn't all that new.\nJust change the dates and a few of the names. One war for the next, One scientific advance for another and\nit all shakes out very much of like ilk, today or a thousand years\ndownriver.\"\nThe\ntraveler, stunned, frowned before he spoke.\n\"I...uh...don't\nunderstand. Others...there have been others?\"\nTwain\nsmiled. \"Enough to fill the\nchurch and the choir besides.\" He\nsavored the cigar a moment more, then squinting, peered more closely at the\ntraveler. \"You look pale lad. I'm\nsorry, I didn't think. This must\nbe a bit much for you. Maybe I\nshould show you something.\" Putting\nthe cigar out on the heel of his shoe, Twain gestured down the hall.\n\"Follow me.\"\nThe\ntraveler stumbled up from his chair, gravity gone from his legs, to be towed\nby Twain back into the darker recesses of the house until they came to a\nlibrary lighted by a large bay window. Twain motioned him in and had him sit in a plush leather\nchair.\n\"This\nis where I travel in time; or perhaps I should say more succinctly, through\ntime.\" Twain said.\nConfused,\nthe traveler could only utter a puzzled question.\n\"How...how does it work?\"\n\"It's\nalready working. Listen.\"\nThe\nhouse breathed in and then exhaled stairs creaking, dishes clattering, low\nvoices murmuring, children laughing. A\nshadow flitted by the open library door followed by the sound of small running\nfeet. A door swung shut.\nLivy Clemens voice floated down from somewhere higher up, calling a\nchild's name. Outside the window\na transport wagon, pulled by large draft horses, groaned and creaked its way\nup the hill. Dogs barked. Time\npassed, gently, swiftly, and inexorably forward.\nSomewhere, some-when a clock chimed in deep-throated tones. The traveler felt himself sinking softly into the passing\ntime of the present. The dust of\na thousand years blown away on the wind of today.\nTwain\ncoughed quietly. \"Do you see\nwhat I mean about traveling through time?\nIn a sense we are all time travelers.\nEvery second of every day is spent traveling through every second of\nevery day.\" He placed an\navuncular hand on the traveler's shoulder.\n\"I know you have come with the very best of intentions.\nYour heart and mind full of the wonders you would reveal to me, the\nsecrets you would wrest from me. Honesty\nand integrity, which you emote with the profusion of Mt. Vesuvius, are\nadmirable qualities. Qualities\nthat I have never been personally responsible for, nor ever will.\"\nTwain smoothed his mustache with thumb and forefinger.\n\"I'm sure you even hoped to gain some new writings from me to take\nback to the future with you.\"\nTwain\nchuckled when the traveler nodded meekly in the affirmative.\n\"I can assure you on that score, my ego is such that I do not have\ngreat ambitions on literary inertia beyond what I know will be my lifetime. As for unpublished works, most of them are walking wounded\nthat my best efforts can't seem to bring down.\u201d\nTwain pulled a cigar from a humidor on his desk and puffed it to lie,\ntossing the spent match into a brass spittoon.\n\u201cYour have questions about my life.\nOther women perhaps, sired children, my childhood, my thoughts, my\nreasons for many actions over all the years?\u201d\nTwain shook his head. \u201cI\nhave no new answers. My life is\nmy own, in so much as I can keep time travelers out from under my bed and from\nunderfoot.\"\nThe\ntraveler, adrift, stared out the window.\n\"But, I came so far...so very far.\"\n\"Haven't\nwe all?\"\n\"Yes,\nI suppose you're right.\"\n\"I\nhave a question of you.\"\n\"Of\nme?\" The traveler\nbrightened.\n\"Halley's\nComet. Does it still swim through\nthe solar system every 75 years or so.\"\n\"Yes,\nbut there's more than just that. We\nhave a base...a town on the comet. They're\nmining it -- living there, artists, writers, it's the center of all that is\nbeautiful in my time.\"\nTwain\npuffed quietly on the cigar for a few moments.\n\"I'm glad to hear that.\"\nHe turned to the traveler. \"An\nold Osage Indian in Missouri told my father when I was born that every living\nthing in the world had its spirit anchored in the heavens.\nSome were brother to the sun, some to the planets.\nHe spoke of mine being brother to the running star, what with me being\nborn the last time the comet made a visit.\" He worked the cigar with tongue and cheek.\n\"There seems to be a great deal of truth in what the old Indian\nsaid. I never put much stock in\nhim then. He was always drunk,\ndisorderly, unclean, and in every respect a civilized man.\"\nTwain walked to the window. \"I\nknow the next tour of the comet will mean my demise -- many of the travelers\nhave told me so. I am very\npleased with that...it's nice to know I already have a ticket to ride.\"\nThere\nwas a soft tap at the library door. A\nchild's face appeared and disappeared, then reappeared.\nTwain\nsnuffed out his cigar and gestured towards the door.\n\"My children. I'm\nafraid I must go. As always the\npresent demands the fullest amount of my time over the past or the future.\u201d Then aside to the young girl at the door.\n\u201cRun along Jean, tell mama I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d\nHe turned to the traveler. \u201cWhat\nare your plans?\u201d\n\u201cHome...I\nsuppose I must go home.\u201d The\none-hour time limit returned to memory. A\nquick check of his eyelid chronometer showed the traveler that he must return\nto the crystal sphere. \"Yes,\nI must go home.\"\nTwain\nlooked intently at the traveler. \"If\nyou had any more of a hangdog look I'd be tempted to send you out to the\nkennel. You are disappointed?\nThe\ntraveler buried his head in his hands. \"I've\naccomplished nothing...nothing at all. You\nhave no idea how much effort has gone into my being here with you!\"\nTwain\nsmiled. \"No more and no less\nthan I have taken to be here myself.\"\nTwain walked behind the desk and opened a drawer.\nInside was a stack of manuscripts all titled the same.\nGlancing briefly at the traveler to make certain he could not see the\nother manuscripts, Twain removed one and closed the drawer.\nHe handed the papers to the traveler.\n\"Here,\ntake this. You cannot return home\nempty handed. This is the\noriginal manuscript to my celebrated \"Frog\" story.\u201d\nThe\ntraveler stared at the manuscript. \"My\nGod, Mr. Twain..Mr. Clemens! This\nis priceless. You have no idea of\nits value.\"\nTwain\nsmiled. \"Oh, I have an\nexcellent grasp of its value. It\nwill be of greater worth to you a thousand years hence than it is to me today.\nTake it and enjoy.\"\nFarewells\nwere exchanged between the traveler and the family before Twain walked him\nback to the sphere, shook hands and stepped away towards the house.\nThe\ntraveler, smiling, waved from inside his crystal sphere as it began to rise\nsilently, majestically into the air. Suddenly,\nforked spears of blue lightning began to envelop the traveler's time machine\nand a second sphere appeared, occupied by a young woman.\nThe traveler and the woman both stared at the other in shock as their\nrespective vehicles faded in and out of displacement with each other.\nThen,\nwith a soap bubble 'pop' and a clap of thunder they both were gone.\nTwain,\nshaking his head, chewed on his cigar for a moment and stared at the dancing\nlight display that silently played and then faded from the site of the\n\"collision\".\nJust\nthen a man came walking up the carriage drive towards the house.\nTwain noted the glass helmet and bulky body suit, sighed and shouted\nback to the house.\n\"Livy\ndear, more coffee.\" Then as\nan afterthought. \"And stop\nby the library.\"","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050903212707\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/janmar2001\/downtime.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The Internet's Premier Magazine of Historical Science Fiction","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/qK101x6foCgAOPKbl+TK76lcSbA.json","volume":2.0,"issues":1.0,"has_text":true}

I built up the fire for him. It was in Massachusetts, he said, at the turn of the century, when they first contacted him. \"Messengers from God,\" he called them, but I knew them too, by then, and I knew better. To each his own, though. John Chapman was nothing if not a religious man. His sort saw God in everything.

I wasn't yet twenty-five years of age, and knew little of the world. All I knew was Massachusetts, my family, and my God. And then they came. Came from the sky, like angels from heaven.\"\n\"Did they look like angels?\" I asked.\n\"What do angels look like, boy? They didn't pop out of some Renaissance painting, but they sure looked like angels to me. They were about this big,\" he held his hand out to about half his height, \"and they didn't glow or anything, but they were the most wonderful creatures....\"\n\"Like they'd been made just to impress you, the greens and the blues....\"\n\"Ah, you've seen them, then.\" I nodded. \"Perhaps you were meant to be my successor in their charge.\"\n\"What did they ask of you?\"\n\"They gave me a little bag. Just a little bigger than my closed fist, and full of little seeds. And they said 'take these, John, and plant them. Take the seeds and their seedlings west, into the new country, and bring them to the farmers there. Without them, the land will wash away, and there will be famine.' So I took their bag and went to Pennsylvania, and started a tree farm. But they've never spoken to me again.\"\n\"Sometimes they don't need to, John. You've done well, can't you see? Your trees thrive throughout the country, and your name is known far and wide.\"\n\"Still, I wish I could have seen them again.

You've done well.\"\n\"Then my soul will be at peace. You - you will carry on my work.\" With that he stood up and, leaving his pack, trudged off into the darkness of the forest.\nA few minutes later, the little spaceship landed where he had been sitting, and my new friends came out of it. \"Thank you, Matthew. You've set Johnny at peace, which we could not have done. Will you come away with us now?\"\n\"Not now, I'm sorry. I find - I find that I have to stay here for a while yet.\"\n\"If that is your wish.

Think of this\nas an opportunity for further cooperation -- a way to cement the peace between\nVenus and Mars.\u201d\nVarantus forced a smile. \u201cWhat will you do\nfirst?\u201d\n\u201cFirst?\u201d Gao asked. \u201cI must consult the Leibniz\nMachine.\u201d\nMorovan led Varantus to the airlock and Gao\nheaded to the room that housed his gigantic reasoning device. He set switches\nand positioned levers, then opened his derivation log and marked a page February\n1st, 1882. If he wanted to get to the bottom of this mess, he\nwould need to be well-armed with logical calculations.\n#\nBrassen met Gao in the airlock of the Crimson\nStorm. Animosity kindled in the big Martian\u2019s eyes, but the professor saw\nhim do his best to master it. \u201cI shall show you where it happened,\u201d Brassen\nsaid as he led Gao down a stony corridor. The interior of the Martian ship\nlooked as if it had been hewn from an asteroid.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Gao. \u201cFollowing that, I\u2019ll\nneed you to return to your quarters and -- \u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Brassen crossed two of his arms over\nhis dark green chest. His third and fourth arms brandished his ceremonial\nspear. \u201cWe are not tame Venusians,\u201d he warned. \u201cOur leader has been murdered\nand every Martian on this vessel hungers for vengeance.\u201d\n\u201cI appreciate that,\u201d said Gao, \u201cbut the exact\nconditions at the time of the ambassador\u2019s death must be maintained if I am\nto determine who the culprit is. If anyone but myself and my assistant are\nallowed to move freely on either vessel, clues could be covered up and evidence\ntampered with.\u201d\nBrassen focused narrowed eyes on Gao but said\nnothing. Gao knew that remaining inactive was a hard pill for the big Martian\nto swallow.\n\u201cWhat about the ice creatures?\u201d Brassen asked\nquietly. \u201cCould they have done this?\u201d\nEarlier that day, Gao and Brassen had discovered\ntwo creatures from distant Planet X attempting to sabotage an interplanetary\npeace conference.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Gao, \u201cbut I promise you\nI will find out.\u201d\nBrassen glanced at the rows of closed steel\ndoors lining the granite corridor. \u201cI will try to protect you,\u201d he said,\n\u201cbut if your investigation fails, my crew will almost certainly try to kill\nyou.\u201d He nodded curtly and stalked away.\nGao followed. \u201cThen wish me luck,\u201d he muttered.\n\u201cGood luck,\u201d said Brassen. Gao made a mental\nnote never to underestimate Martian hearing.\n\u201cWhy is it so hot in here?\u201d Gao asked as they\nentered a large stone chamber. A chalk outline showed where the ambassador\u2019s\nbody had been found, slumped over a jewel-crusted stone table. A hazy light\nshone in the center of the room and Gao squinted, trying to --\n\u201cDo not look directly at it,\u201d Brassen warned,\n\u201cor it will stop working.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Gao asked, feeling beads of\nsweat gather on his brow.\n\u201cThat is our faster-than-light drive. It\ncreates a large amount of heat.\u201d\n\u201cThen our friends from Planet X cannot be\nthe culprits,\u201d said Gao. \u201cThey could never survive this heat.\u201d He looked\nagain at the chalk outline. \u201cWhy was the ambassador in here?\u201d\n\u201cOld men,\u201d said Brassen. For the briefest\nof moments, his perpetual frown became a grin. \u201cThey love the heat.\u201d\nCareful to avert his gaze, Gao stepped toward\nthe mysterious drive.\n\u201cDo not go there,\u201d said Brassen. \u201cThe heat\nrises exponentially as you approach.\u201d\nGao stepped away. \u201cWhere is the ambassador\u2019s\nbody now?\u201d\n\u201cIn our morgue.\u201d\n\u201cTake me there,\u201d Gao said, \u201cand then I must\ninsist that you confine yourself to your quarters.\u201d\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Brassen. He handed Gao\nwhat looked like a coconut sliced in half. \u201cIf you need my assistance, speak\ninto this device.\u201d\nGao nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nThe morgue, with its floors and walls of gleaming\nplasteel, reminded Gao of the interior of a Venusian ship. The ambassador\u2019s\npale body lay on a leather-covered table in the middle of the room. Gao gazed\nat his friend\u2019s still form and, for a moment, could not believe that the ambassador\nwas really dead. Feeling out of sorts, Gao shivered as the remnant of a dream\nbrushed his consciousness. He had fallen asleep worrying over the increasing\nnumber of artificial constants needed to get sensible derivations from the\nLeibniz Machine, almost as if reality itself had gone astray. As if Gao no\nlonger lived in a rationally ordered universe. Perhaps --\n\u201cI am going to the bridge now.\u201d The odd feeling\nvanished as Brassen spoke, bringing Gao\u2019s mind back to the present. The professor\nturned and saw the Martian\u2019s muscular form framed by the morgue door.\n\u201cI asked you to go to your quarters.\u201d\nBrassen shook his head. \u201cThe Crimson Storm\ncannot be left entirely unmonitored. I promise that I will not leave the\nbridge, however -- short of an emergency.\u201d\nGao nodded and turned back to the ambassador\u2019s\nbody. \u201cThere are sensors on that console,\u201d came Brassen\u2019s voice. Gao looked\njust beyond the table and saw the console. \u201cWe... acquired it recently from\nthe Venusians.\u201d Gao watched Brassen\u2019s form turn and leave in the reflection\nof the multi-faceted gem at the console\u2019s center.\nGao took a physical step back, simultaneously\ndistancing himself emotionally. He was not a medical doctor, and needed to\nremain dispassionate in order to piece together what had happened. The Leibniz\nMachine had indicated that a clear solution existed, but the increasing problems\nwith the machine\u2019s accuracy had prevented Gao from determining the solution\nbeforehand.\nA solution to every puzzle, he reminded himself.\nAn answer to every problem.\nGently, he lifted the ambassador\u2019s wrist.\nThe fingers were calloused and well-used, but undamaged. Gao studied the\nrest of the ambassador\u2019s skin and nodded: there had been no struggle. As\nfar as Gao could see, the ambassador had not been hit or cut, meaning some\nother, more subtle agent had caused the old man\u2019s death.\nGao moved to the sensor console, wondering\nif he could configure it to scan the ambassador internally. The largest facet\nof the gem showed what Gao took to be a diagram of the Crimson Storm. He\nassumed the blip moving against the still background to be Brassen, heading\nfor the forward-most compartment. The jewel flickered and Brassen disappeared,\nreplaced by a different sort of blip in a different section of the ship.\nWondering what he had done, Gao passed his\nfingers over a few of the smaller stones on the jewel-encrusted table. Having\npracticed with the Leibniz Machine for so many years, the professor found\nhe had an intuitive grasp of most devices, including the Venusian console.\nA smaller face of the gem flashed to life,\nshowing first the morgue, then the ambassador, and then the ambassador\u2019s internal\norgans as Gao directed the view closer and closer. \u201cAha,\u201d he exclaimed.\nReaching into his vest pocket, he removed his bifocals. \u201cJust as I thought.\u201d\nIf Gao read the Venusian symbols correctly, the ambassador had been poisoned\nby a self-administered dose of Sram, a compound deadly to Martian biology.\n\u201cBut Sram leaves an easily-traceable residue,\u201d Gao thought out loud, \u201cso someone\nhad to dispose of it after the ambassador killed himself.\u201d\nGao spun about. But who was the accomplice?\nRunning through the possibilities, he stared at the doorway.\nSuddenly mindful of something else, he spun\nback to the console. Gao had gained enough experience with the sensors to\nknow that he had not caused the shift in the internal schematic, as he originally\nthought. Focusing his attention once again on the main face, Gao saw that\nthe second blip had entered the engine room. The new blip had a thermal signature\nvery different from a Martian\u2019s, and stood about half as high as a human being.\nThere was only one place a creature with readings\nlike that could come from: Planet X. Gao raced from the morgue to the engine\nroom, though he had no idea what he should do when he got there.\nGao pressed his back to the rocky wall just\noutside the engine room. The professor was no fighter, but he knew better\nthan to leave his back exposed any more than necessary. Remembering a bare-knuckled\nboxing match he had seen outside of Tsingdao, he shifted his thumb from the\ninside to the outside of his clenched fist. He sprang into the engine room\nand saw... nothing.\nGao squinted at every item in the room, trying\nto determine if it had been present before. The Planet Xers at the conference\nhad demonstrated an amazing ability to disguise themselves, even successfully\nimitating a Martian despite extreme differences in gross physical anatomy.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in here,\u201d said Gao in his most commanding tone. If you\u2019re in here,\nthen what? he thought.\nHe turned and -- ducked! Brassen\u2019s spear swished\nthrough the air just above the professor\u2019s head, disturbing the few wispy\nhairs still growing from his scalp.\n\u201cWhat are you doing, you idiot?\u201d Gao demanded.\nSeveral other large, armed Martians waited just behind Brassen. Eyes narrowed,\nBrassen prepared his spear for another swing.\n\u201cWait,\u201d Gao said. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you think.\u201d\nBrassen looked unconvinced. \u201cWe tracked you\nhere, monster. I nearly skewered you or one of your kin at the conference.\nThis time, I mean to carry the task to completion.\u201d\n\u201cThose sensor readings were faked,\u201d Gao said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s an Xer here at all.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s\na bigger game being played here than just murder,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ambassador\ntook his own life.\u201d\n\u201cLiar!\u201d yelled Brassen. His flat nostrils\nflared. \u201cSuch an action would disgrace both the ambassador and his ancestors!\u201d\nGao stepped back, and Brassen didn\u2019t close\nthe distance. \u201cI see you\u2019re ready to listen to reason,\u201d said Gao. \u201cThe ambassador\nhad an accomplice. If we -- \u201d\nGao shrieked as Brassen dug the point of his\nspear into Gao\u2019s shoulder. \u201cPlease stop that!\u201d Gao yelled. He grabbed his\nshoulder and his hand came away dripping blood. \u201cBrassen, you moron!\u201d he\nadmonished.\nThe Martians had become very serious. Crouching\nlow, Brassen had closed his eyes. He\u2019s trying not to look at the engine,\nGao realized. As quietly as possible, Gao shifted back and to the right.\nWhether because of the increased heat from the drive, or because of his wounded\nshoulder, he nearly lost his balance. Through the haze that had sprung up\nin front of his eyes, Gao noticed beads of sweat forming on Brassen\u2019s arms\nand brow. Mars stood twice as far from the sun as the Earth, and Gao gambled\nthat Brassen would prove twice as susceptible to the heat as an Earthman.\nGao backed up another step and Brassen advanced,\nlistening carefully and trying to get a fix on him. Gao wanted to tell Brassen\nthat someone played him for a fool, but he knew would die the moment he spoke.\nHeat seared the back of Gao\u2019s neck and he\nfelt the skin on the back of his ankles blister. His flame-licked world shimmered\nand spun, and Gao realized that more than just the heat and lost blood was\naffecting him: the faster-than-light drive was distorting time and space\naround him. A distant, detached corner of Gao\u2019s brain noted that the ambassador\u2019s\naccomplice must have used the drive to dispose of the Sram.\nBrassen, skin a green so dark it looked nearly\nblack, collapsed to the rough floor. Gao hurried forward and tried to drag\nthe big Martian back to safety. He was joined by a pair of strong green hands\n-- and then another.\nGao sat hard on the rough stone. He tried\nto wipe the sweat from his brow, but his shoulder hurt too much. The Martian\nwho\u2019d helped Gao retrieve Brassen wiped it for him with a hot green hand.\nSweating profusely, the Martian shook his\nhead. \u201cNo ice creature could withstand that.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d Gao cried as the last piece of\nthe puzzle fell into place. Finally, he understood what the Leibniz Machine\nhad tried to show him.\n\u201cWhat of the creature?\u201d demanded another of\nthe Martians. Five of them stood in close-quarters, swaying slightly in unison.\nGao had read of this behavior: it signified the Martian blood rage. Earlier\nthat day, the Martians had learned of the existence of an interplanetary power\nbent on destroying them; then their leader had died, and another was just\nbested in combat with an Earthman. They needed to lash out at something,\nand Gao had to make sure they didn\u2019t target Varantus\u2019 ship, or Gao himself.\n\u201cThe creature escaped!\u201d Gao cried. Leaning\non the Martian who had helped him rescue Brassen, Gao stood. \u201cHe came to\nsow further distrust, but we have bested him.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take the fight to his homeworld!\u201d yelled\nthe Martian Gao leaned on. He moved forward, and Gao stumbled. \u201cAlert the\nfleet,\u201d he ordered one of his officers. \u201cTell them to prepare for an invasion.\u201d\nGao stared, dumbfounded. He had thought this\nparticular Martian rather level-headed. And he had seemed to understand there\nhad never been a Planet Xer present... The Martian gave Gao a wink, and Gao\nunderstood. They have their politicians as well, he supposed. This one had\ngrabbed power and given his people a quest -- and gotten Gao out of a sticky\nsituation to boot.\n\u201cDo you need medical assistance?\u201d asked the\nMartian.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Gao said, unable to keep the annoyance\nfrom his voice. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think you can help me here. I\u2019ll -- \u201d\n\u201cYou should return to your vessel,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhat about Brassen?\u201d asked Gao.\n\u201cA diplomatic aide,\u201d said the Martian. \u201cHe\nshould not have been given command of a spaceship. But do not worry -- he\nwill not be harmed.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d said Gao. He limped forward, eager\nto be rid of the Martians and their ship.\n#\nMorovan changed Gao\u2019s bandage, then stood\nstaring at the wound as if he could undo the injury by force of will.\n\u201cThank you, Morovan,\u201d said Gao, moving his\nhead this way and that to force his pillow into a more comfortable shape.\n\u201cMore iced-tea, please.\u201d Gao placed an arm to his forehead. \u201cI\u2019m still overheated.\u201d\nThe Moon Man departed and Varantus studied\nGao guiltily.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay, Varantus,\u201d said Gao.\n\u201cBut I want to,\u201d said the Venusian. \u201cI want\nyou to know that I\u2019m stepping down as chancellor.\u201d\nGao raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\nAfter all, I can\u2019t prove anything.\u201d\nVarantus chewed his lip. \u201cWhen did you figure\nit out, Thompson?\u201d\n\u201cWhen Brassen collapsed. Only a Venusian\ncould withstand the heat long enough to dispose of the Sram, and only a Venusian\nwould have been able to manipulate the sensor readings to make it appear a\nPlanet Xer was onboard the Crimson Storm.\u201d\n\u201cThat still doesn\u2019t prove I was the ambassador\u2019s\naccomplice,\u201d said Varantus.\n\u201cTrue,\u201d said Gao, \u201cbut you\u2019re the only Venusian\nthe ambassador trusted.\u201d\nVarantus frowned. Clearly, he regretted what\nhad happened.\n\u201cBut why did you do it?\u201d Gao asked, sitting\nup. \u201cWhat could possibly have made the ambassador give up his life, and you\nyour post?\u201d\nVarantus moved to the portal in Gao\u2019s room\nand looked out at the massing Martian fleet.\n\u201cYou wanted the Martians to attack Planet\nX? You\u2019ve always been a strong proponent of peace.\u201d\nVarantus turned conflicted eyes on Gao. \u201cI\nam no longer sure what to believe,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ambassador and I acted\nas we did to achieve a greater purpose, but that purpose is as yet unknown\nto me.\u201d\nGao frowned. Varantus barely made sense.\nThe Venusian turned back to the portal. \u201cYou\u2019re\ngoing along?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Gao. \u201cBrassen has been promoted\nto full ambassador, and requested my presence.\u201d\nVarantus nodded, turned, and went to the door\njust as Morovan arrived with the iced-tea. \u201cFarewell, professor,\u201d said Varantus.\n\u201cI hope we shall meet again.\u201d\n\u201cFarewell,\u201d said Gao. His iced-tea tasted\nbitter.\nGao stood and, under Morovan\u2019s disapproving\ngaze, moved to the portal. A war was underway, the solar system about to\nbecome a much more dangerous place. Gao had lost Varantus and the ambassador,\nhis only friends out in the void of space, yet he didn\u2019t feel quite as bad\nas he should have.\nGao turned to Morovan and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m going\nto a new world,\u201d he said. \u201cAt last, I have become an explorer again.\u201d","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050727004221\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com:80\/martianambassador.htm","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/B8dTFxI6d3iOA0gzgYMtif0snV8.json","volume":5.0,"issues":3.0,"has_text":true}

Even with the rest of the shop\nforce out with the plows, the home office in Chicago insisted we keep to our deadline. So old Ira, our coach painter, and his apprentice\nJeremy set to adding the final gold striping and lettering\nwhile I kept them company.\nI hung around with them partly because this was\nthe only warm spot in the Oelwein, Iowa railroad yards and partly because I was fascinated\nby their work. Watching Ira apply the delicate gold leaf\nwas a genuine pleasure. Here was a craftsman of the old\nschool, master of an art that was rapidly vanishing. Even\nPullman uses deluxe yellow\npaint for their lettering, any more. I was the Chicago\nGreat Western railroad's company photographer and had been\nsent from Chicago a week ago as advance man for the inspection party.\nDespite the poor light in the car shop, I was able to get\na couple photographs of Ira and Jeremy at work for my personal\ncollection.\nTwo days later,\nwe wheeled her out into the bright sun for her official\nphotographs. Boy, she was a sight! The Bluebird, we\ncalled her, and the name fit. The Oelwein shop crew had\ndone a remarkable job.\nBack last\nOctober, there had been three old McKeen motorcars sitting\non a siding next to the shop. Built in 1910, they had\nnever been very reliable and were now out of service needing\nmore repairs than they were worth. Well sir, someone came\nup with the idea of rebuilding two of them as trailers and\nputting a new engine in the third to create a motor driven\npassenger train.\nNormally, an idea like that would die a swift and\ndeserving death, but just then the Chicago Great Western\nwas in a bind. Look at any map and you'll see that the\narea between Chicago, St. Louis, Omaha and the Twin Cities is covered with rails. Too many rails, in fact,\nand the smaller roads like the Great Western are constantly\nfighting for survival.\nThe home office in Chicago had been agonizing\nover this fact, particularly the declining passenger loadings\nas the regional economy was slipping into recession. Something\nhad to be done to reduce costs and - hopefully - grab the\npublic's attention. So when this cockamamie idea came\nin from Oelwein, they latched onto it instead of firing\nsomeone.\nThe question\nnow was: would it work?\n*****\nThe bosses came around from Chicago a few days later to\nsee their new passenger train and the Bluebird sat in the\nOelwein passenger station, her engine rumbling steadily,\nwaiting to receive them. Her McKeen heritage was plain\nto see in her rounded roofs and arched windows, but her\nnew front end - rebuilt to hold the large distillate engine\nfrom Electro-Motive - gave her a brutish, square shouldered\nlook. The carbodies were a rich blue accented with Ira's\ngold pinstriping and lettering, and the underframes and\nturtle roofs were glossy black. Yes sir, January 10, 1929\nwill be a day to remember on the Great Western, and the\nshop force here at Oelwein was as proud as a new papa.\nShe was as ugly as sin, and we loved her.\nApparently, so did Mr. Radcliff, the Superintendent.\nHe had brought a gaggle of reporters from Chicago and invited more from\nMinneapolis and towns along the line, so we had a full load\nthat morning.\nWe stood on\nthe open platform stamping and shivering from the cold,\nthe reporters ogling this nine-day wonder and me, a company\nman, hovering in the background to answer any questions.\nIt was then that I first noticed the two of them. They\nseemed ordinary enough at first, dressed in heavy coats\nand festooned with cameras and equipment. They were off\nseparate from the mob, carefully examining the lead car.\nStanding nearby, I happened to overhear their conversation\nand was struck by how dismayed they seemed.\n\"It's\n- not like we thought.\" one mumbled.\n\"Greener.\"\nthe other replied.\n\"The\npaint chips must have shifted over the years.\"\n\"More\nlikely the raw materials have changed since then. The\nmodern formulation is wrong.\" He began digging through\nhis equipment pouch. \"We need a shot of this.\"\nHe came up\nwith a small disk of paper and stuck it to the side of the\ncarbody. I could see that it was divided like a pie into\nred, yellow, blue, black and white segments. Facing the\ncar, he peered through his camera's viewfinder, carefully\nfiddling with the controls. The camera gave a faint musical\n'ping'. He fiddled some more, then came another 'ping'.\nHe then carefully peeled the color wheel off the car and\nstuffed it into his pouch.\nThat was when\nI realized there was something fishy about these two.\nThat tall chap had taken two photos without reloading his\ncamera! And what was this 'ping' business, I wondered?\nAnd why take pictures of paint? Odd.\nIn the meantime, Mr. Radcliff was making a speech\nto the assembled press, who seemed skeptical about this\nmotor train idea. Motorcars are far less expensive to\noperate than steam trains, he pointed out, and over the\nlast 15 years their reduced cost had saved many lightly\ntraveled branch line services. The Bluebird (he went on\nto explain) would take this economy up to the next level,\nproviding daily service between Minneapolis and Rochester. Until now, this\nwas ambitious for a motorcar and the bets were this new\nmarvel would die in the middle of nowhere, leaving them\nto freeze. The Bluebird might just prove them wrong -\nor might not.\nIgnoring the\nfestivities, the two were hard at work photographing every\nsquare inch of the lead car. As I watched, the taller\none opened a cover on the back of his camera and extracted\na small flat disk about the size of a silver dollar. Slipping\nit into his pouch, he took out a package, tore it open and\nproduced a new disk, slipping it into the camera.\n'They're not\nusing film?' I thought. 'What is it about these two?'\nWell, they\nmust have been using something, because they pointed their\ncameras at the track, at switch stands, at the station,\nbaggage wagons, signals, shanties and crewmen. They seemed\ngrimly determined to take pictures of every item on the\nGreat Western right of way, and the frosty air was filled\nwith faint, merry 'pinging'. Fascinated, I kept a careful\neye on them, and when the tall one paused to load a new\ndisk, I realized he had taken about 100 photos! That little\ndisk beat hell out of the clumsy film slides my Kodak used.\nI wondered enviously where I could get a camera like that.\nFinally the\nspeeches were done and we crowded aboard the Bluebird, each\nreporter surrendering his visitor's pass to Detective Quinn\nas he boarded. Quinn was a beefy Irishman with a hard\neye and a too-ready Colt 44 under his coat. Like all cops,\nhe could get nasty with someone he took a disliking to.\nThose two must have also struck him as odd, because he questioned\nthem closely when it came their turn to board.\n\"We're\nindependent journalists.\" the tall fellow, who introduced\nhimself as \"Chuck\", said.\n\"We're\ndoing an article on this train for Railroad Modelmaker.\"\nhis friend \"Al\" added. \"Not to mention\ncatching anything else interesting we happen to see - for\nfuture reference.\" he gave me a secretive wink at that\nand snapped a picture of me and my cumbersome Kodak bellows\ncamera.\nQuinn brooded\nover their passes as I snuck a look at them. They seemed\nin order, although I noted that their names had been typed\nin over Mr. Radcliff's signature. Usually passes are filled\nout by hand, although there was nothing irregular about\nthese, strictly speaking.\nQuinn and I aren't friends (nobody cares to associate\nwith a railroad dick) but we knew each other from the Chicago office. The guy was\na real iron puss, but as much as he wanted to dig into this,\nthe line was waiting. He let them pass. 'You two better\nmind your manners.' I thought to myself.\n*****\nThe Bluebird\nwas a complete train in only three short cars. The first\nunit had the engine compartment, a small Railway Post Office\nand the baggage compartment. The second unit had coach\nseating - reasonably comfortable at a modest price - while\nthe third unit was the real prize. This car had a tiny\nkitchen and dining section, then a section of lounge seats,\nthen two Pullman berths (for invalids heading to the Mayo\nClinic in Rochester) and finally the rounded end of the\ncar was a smoking lounge. All the comforts of the 'Broadway\nLimited' at an upper-Midwestern price!\nIf the two\nof them had been enthusiastic about the outside of the train,\nthey went berserk once they were aboard; literally taking\npictures of the upholstery, ash trays, even the floor tile!\nOnce again the air was filled with their faint 'pinging'\nwhile Quinn and I watched, bemused.\n*****\nEveryone aboard,\nour engineer, Sven Neilssen, released the air brakes, applied\na bit of sand and cranked the throttle open. The distillate\nengine roared and bucked and threw out a cloud of black\nsmoke - then we eased smoothly away from the station.\nWithin moments, we had cleared the yard and were gaining\nspeed steadily as the press corps settled up their bets.\nSoon we were\nrolling smoothly along over the wintery countryside, the\ncars rocking gently and everyone busy gossiping about this\nnew marvel. The air was thick with cigar smoke and a couple\nof bottles were making the rounds. Willie, the colored\nsteward, circulated with a tray of snacks and we helped\nourselves to the tureen of coffee on the counter. I happened\nto catch Mr. Radcliff's eye and we exchanged small smiles.\nSo far, so good.\nMorning turned into midday\nand the Bluebird was making steady time. The crowd was\ncomfortably settled and a new round of bottles had mysteriously\nappeared. (Prohibition must have been repealed without\nus hearing of it, I thought, amused.) Willie was serving\nsandwiches and tea, and a couple of Chicago journalists were sampling\nthe Pullman sections (one snoring loudly, an empty hip flask\nstill clutched in his hand).\nOur two strangers\nwere all over the place like kids in a candy store. Evidently\nthey were getting an enormous kick out of being here, and\nonce they ran out of things to photograph, they began exploring\nthe train.\nMidday turned into afternoon and we were rolling smoothly\nnorth. I made my way forward and checked with Sven and\nthe Electro-Motive company rep, who reported everything\nworking just fine. The toolbox was open and the rep's\nhands covered with grease, but I decided not to make anything\nof it. On my way back, I ran into the two of them headed\nforward.\nOur big stop of the day was at Rochester, Minnesota, the Bluebird's destination\nin regular service. The station was only a few blocks\nfrom the famed Mayo Clinic, and a delegation from the medical\nstaff was on hand to join the celebration.\nSo far, the Bluebird was a champion and we were\non time and in good form. We paused for an hour or so\nto allow the locals to tour the train. They were favorably\nimpressed and the local journalists in particular made large\nover the Pullman sections for disabled travelers. This sort of\npersonalized service is what gives small roads like the\nGreat Western an edge over the big carriers, and the patronage\nrumbled approvingly at this innovation.\nMr. Radcliff\nand I conferred briefly and were pleased with how things\nwere going thus far. It seemed that this motor train idea\nwas working, and he mentioned that he would suggest motorizing\nour entire passenger fleet at the next Board meeting.\nI had to admit that I was skeptical about that, seeing how\nthe economy was going.\nWe pulled into Randolph a bit after 4.00 PM and the two of them got up\nto their antics again, jumping to the platform even before\nwe stopped. No sooner had we cleared the main then #8,\nthe 'Mill Cities Limited', came roaring past en-route to\nKansas City. Ping-ping-ping-ping-ping\ntheir cameras fired steadily and repeatedly as they followed\nthe swiftly moving train like marksmen pursuing a fleeing\ndeer.\n\"How\ndid they know?\" Willie asked me as we watched their\nodd performance from the rear car. Apparently he had been\nkeeping tabs on these two characters as well.\n\"Hmmm?\"\n\"How\ndid they know the 'Mill Cities' was a half-hour late?\"\nHe was right, now that I thought of it. They had scrambled\nto get in position like they knew they had only seconds\nto spare.\nThen I happened\nto notice a bit of bright color lying on the right of way.\nLooking closer, I saw that it was one of the wrappers for\nChuck's disks. Why, I don't know, but I slipped quickly\noff the step, snagged the pit of paper and stuffed it in\nmy pocket as the Bluebird started moving.\nThe Bluebird pulled into Minneapolis Union Station\nshortly after 5.30\nPM to a crowd of local dignitaries, more journalists\nand curious onlookers. The trip had gone smoothly, the\npress loved us, and there was no doubt in our minds that\nthe Bluebird would be a solid success when she entered service\non the 13th.\nThere were\nmore speeches and general carrying on to occupy my attention\nfor the next hour or so, and when I thought to look for\nour two mysterious photographers, they had vanished.\n*****\nQuinn finally\nsolved the riddle of those two, if we can say it was solved.\nHe thought to check the passes against the Superintendent's\nmaster list and discovered to his amazement that not only\nwere they not listed, but the batch those passes came from\nwas still at the printer. To prove his point, Quinn produced\nthe genuine passes, still unmarked, from the new batch that\nhad arrived two days later.\n\"A marvelous\nforgery, I must say!\" Mr. Radcliff commented, examining\nhis signatures on the two bogus passes carefully. \"But\nI don't understand why these gentlemen didn't simply apply\nfor real ones. We would have welcomed more journalists.\"\n\"I'm - not sure they are forgeries, sir.\"\nQuinn said, uneasily. We had talked this mystery over\nat length in the past week and had reluctantly decided that\nit had to come to the Super's attention. Between us, we\nexplained about their strange behavior, their exotic equipment\nand their fixation with little details that we took for\ngranted. Then there was the timing of the two forged passes.\nAnd to top it off, no one had ever heard of a Railroad Modelmaker\nmagazine. But the clincher was the wrapper Chuck had dropped\nand I had picked up at Randolph. It was made of some odd, dense paper almost\nlike isinglass. Printed on it was:\nPANA-CHROME\nCOLOR DISC\nNIKON\nN3 STANDARD\n100\nEXPOSURES FORMATTED\n2.500\nGIGS - 400 KB\/S SPEED\nmfg\n6\/2014\nMr. Radcliff\nturned pale when he saw that. \"You don't seriously\nsuppose - ?\"\nQuinn nodded\ngravely. \"It's the only explanation that fits.\"\nHe'd put his career on the line to say that and was relieved\nthat Mr. Radcliff didn't dismiss the idea out of hand.\n\"But\n- \" Mr. Radcliff was clearly shaken, \" - time\ntravelers? Can that possibly be?\" We had all read\nthe popular romances by H. G. Wells and Jules Verne, but\nto be confronted by such fancies as cold, hard fact was\nstunning.\n\"Historians.\"\nI suggested. \"They came here - er, back here - to\nrecord an important moment in history.\"\nThat thought\nleft us all feeling rather giddy. We had had a brush with\nsomething cosmic, like out of a Scientific Romance novel.\nTo think that our little railroad would be a turning point\nin human events!\nBut then the\nimplications hit me. \"What?\" Mr. Radcliff asked,\nseeing me sag where I stood.\n\"I -\ncan't help but wonder what they knew about the railroad's\nfuture.\" I said slowly. \"The way they acted,\nyou'd think they had never seen the Great Western before\n- or any railroad, for that matter.\"\nThey looked\nat me in confusion, then our eyes were drawn to the wall\nmap showing the overbuilt, financially overextended Midwestern\nrail network.\n\"Oh,\ndear Lord!\" Mr. Radcliff sagged in his chair, staring\noff at nothing. There was a long silence, a funeral silence,\nas indeed this meeting had become a funeral.\n\"Isn't\nthere anything we can do?\" Quinn asked at long last.\nBut we all knew the answer. There is no appeal to the\njudgment of history.\nAfter a time,\nMr. Radcliff's eyes focused on the two blank passes lying\non his desk. \"Yes.\" he said somberly. \"There\nis one thing we can do.\"\nSitting on\nthe table opposite was a paperboard box for records going\ninto long-term storage. With the beginning of the new\nyear, Mr. Radcliff had been clearing his files of outdated\nmaterial. Once filled, that box would join 50 years of\nancient paperwork in the basement archives.\nMr. Radcliff\npicked up the two blank passes, drew his fountain pen and\nsigned them. \"See that these are included in the\narchives.\" he said, nodding toward the records box.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050727004221\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/octdec2003\/daytoremember.htm","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/Brgh9mpyU7jVkJAPxsHVxumEmLo.json","volume":4.0,"issues":4.0,"has_text":true}

Manuel lost the power of speech and endured the\nominous summer squatting by the Rio Caima, watching its crystalline waters\nmeandering through his verdant valley and out of sight.\nManuel\nSabetudo enacted the accident in his mind, knelt over his own body, motioned\nthe sealing of his eyes, followed the crowd home where they deposited his\ncorpse, then helped them remove his torn clothes and bathe him, blushing for\nhe was a modest man. Bathing, Manuel's fingers traced the pools of bruises\ncovering his skin. Deep bruises, the colour of sick ponds, lighter bruises,\nthe colour of summer skies. Later, he sat vigil with the villagers, moved to\ntears by the inundation of flowers, the singing, the feverish prayers. He\njoined his own funeral procession singing louder than the rest, but no one\nnoticed. He sat next to the priest at his Seventh Day Mass and joined the\ncongregated in sacred communion.\nThat\nsummer, Manuel Sabetudo dug his own burial pit and slept in his grave,\nbecoming acquainted with the flesh's final abode, searching out the most\ncomfortable position for his eternal rest. A man of tormented sleep, he lay on\nhis back gazing at the stars, but his bones complained, heaven so far above\noutside his reach. After a month of trials, tossing and turning, he settled on\nhis belly, the best vantage point to observe the approaching worms.\nVillagers\nsighted Manuel Sabetudo veiled in the morning mists at the mouth of the River\nCaima, squatting without a fishing line, mesmerized by the current. By\nmid-day, during the sesta and while\nthe others rested, Manuel paced from Oliveira's crossroad to his home, then to\nthe graveyard and the church. A daily routine performed in earnest silence.\nSome speculated that his state was in anticipation of the world's apocalyptic\nend. Some guessed he might have encountered his own ghost. Despite their\nmusings, no one succeeded in extricating the truth and he walked about as if\nhe were invisible to the world, already a soul from beyond.\nThe\nday of his predestined death, for the first time since his vision, Manuel\nSabetudo bathed in the Caima and groomed himself, parting his hair to\nperfection. He dressed in his black suit, knowing it would be torn to shreds.\nHe walked through the market crowd lifting his hat, thanking people beforehand\nfor the splendid roses, lilacs and chrysanthemums each one would bring to his\nfuneral. They would remember his wishes.\nBefore\nproceeding to his death Manuel Sabetudo made a detour to the grave digger's\nhouse and voiced his special instructions, belly-down, no casket; stopping\nnext door at the priest=s to pinpoint the scriptures he wished read at his\nfuneral, \"Of those who lie sleeping in the dust of the earth many will\nawake,\" from the Book of Daniel and, \"It is good and holy to think\nof the dead rising again,\" from the Maccabees.\nBy\nthe time his errands were finished and his private good-byes voiced, the\nentire village, a following of hundreds, trailed Manuel Sabetudo like a\nprocession. They were curious. How could one confront death on such a sunny\nand glorious day? Not a hint of a breeze to topple a tree like Cipriano\nBispo's fate years before, nor a hint of a thunder cloud to fulminate him like\nRossandra Ferreira. After completing a perfect circle around the town wall,\nManuel stopped. His back to the crowd, he faced the hollow darkness of the\nvillage portal. The portal funneled the distant marble glow of the cemetery.\nHe looked up for the omen. It was then that out of the cloudless blue a flying\nsaucer crossed the village skies. A roar coarser than thunder trembled the\nground, a white apocalyptic line slashed the air, convincing the\nreligious-minded that Manuel Sabetudo predicted the end of the world. In a\npanic, the fearful herd of villagers stampeded towards the protection of their\nwalls trampling everything in their path.\nAnd\non the rare occasion the thunderous roar would return to slash the white\napocalyptic line over their haunted sky, villagers would drop scythe, hammer\nor kettle and hurry to Manuel's headstone where they would huddle in prayer,\nfreshening his grave with roses, lilacs and chrysanthemums. Manuel Sabetudo,\nthey believed, averted the end of the world by offering his life to God. A\nsaintly death, so their lives could be spared. The villagers remembered\nManuel's funeral scriptures and prayed by his grave, awaiting the day of his\nawakening when Manuel would return to free their troubled consciences.\nManuel\nSabetudo would wake up from his eternal abode, moved to tears by the\ninundation of flowers. He would smell each flower and join his people and\ntheir feverish hymns, singing louder than the rest, but no one ever noticed.\nYears\npassed. The villagers returned less and less frequently. Manuel Sabetudo,\ntired of rising up from his grave, slowly succumbed to eternal rest.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050903212707\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com\/janmar2001\/roses.html","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":"The Internet's Premier Magazine of Historical Science Fiction","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/4qstaFe+kLQ2UzHi-ZVhTYI47Us.json","volume":2.0,"issues":1.0,"has_text":true}

With every fiber of his being, with every drop of blood in his body,\nJohn Gray wished he had never found the mysterious stranger on his prairie.\nHow he railed and yowled at\nperfidious fate and his own na\u010fve stupidity. Why had he not simply left the\ninterloper exactly where he found him? Merciful Nature would have taken care of\nthe rest; by morning the stranger would have been frozen as solid as iron. Dash\nit all to blazes, why could he have not left well enough alone?\nFor the devil had come to Deer Lick\nand was living under John Gray\u2019s roof, or so he heartily believed.\nFor three days the stranger lay\nfeverish and delirious in John Gray\u2019s bed, and responded neither to the\nremedies the doctor forced past his teeth nor to the entreaties of John Gray\u2019s\nwife and daughter. Sally and Mary both had become enthralled in the mystery of\nthe stranger\u2019s appearance and his bizarre babblings. The village medical man,\nDr. Hastings, was likewise fascinated and rode all the way to Brighton to cable\nhis colleagues across the county asking for advice about the stranger\u2019s odd\nsymptoms.\n\u201cNever seen a fever like it,\u201d he\nconfided to John Gray on the third day after the stranger\u2019s arrival. \u201cIt spikes\nway up to a hunnert-and-five, then drops to normal and then back up again, all\nin less than a quarter hour. A child can handle fever like that for a day,\nmaybe two, but a grown man? Never seen it. He should be dead, by all rights. Or\nif not dead, then all bunged up in the brain for sure.\u201d\n\u201cWell maybe he is,\u201d replied\nJohn Gray, \u201cmaybe that\u2019s why he yammers and jabbers in them heathen tongues all\nday and all night.\u201d\nDr. Hastings smiled and shook his\nhead slowly. He chose his words carefully to avoid giving offense, but not so\ncarefully that John Gray would forget who was the educated man and who was the\ndirt farmer. \u201cHe may be jabbering, John, but it\u2019s perfectly respectable\nChristian jabber in French and German and Eye-talian. Spanish, too. And one or\ntwo lingoes I never heard before, maybe Russian or Bohemian.\u201d\nJohn Gray shrugged and said, \u201cIf\nEnglish was good enough for Jesus Christ, it\u2019s good enough for me, I reckon.\nDon\u2019t need any of this silly foreign jibber-jabber.\u201d At this, Dr. Hastings\u2019\nlips began to twitch uncontrollably and he quickly excused himself to take his\nsupper at home.\nWith the exception of the great\nunpleasantness some called a Civil War and some called a War Between the\nStates, John Gray had never experienced a significant change or surprise in his\nlife. To have so many thrust upon him in so short a time created an almost\nunbearable tension in the man. He barked orders and insults and fairly turned purple\nin the face when Mary fell at his feet sobbing, begging him again to reverse\nhis ban on Hugh Gregory.\n\u201cDon\u2019t backtalk me, missy!\u201d John Gray\nyelled, lifting his hand menacingly. \u201cI am your father and you\u2019ll just obey\nme!\u201d Mary flinched in surprise. For all his gruffness, her father had never\nraised his hand in anger against her in all her twenty years.\n\u201cYes, father,\u201d she replied in a tone\nthat would have broken John Gray\u2019s heart a mere three days earlier.\n\"Interesting,\" came a soft\nvoice from behind John Gray as his daughter sobbed. \"Nicht wahr? Tr\u010ds int\u00e9ressant.\"\nThe farmer whirled. Standing at the\nentranceway to the room, the picture of unconcern, was the stranger, dressed\nonly in the spare, tattered nightshirt the old farmer had donated for the purpose.\n\"La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 patriarcale,\" he continued to mutter. \"My, oh\nmy. It is one thing to read about something, and another thing again to\nexperience it in the flesh.\"\nJohn Gray stared dumbstruck as the\nstranger wandered into the room and began circling father and daughter,\nexamining them as if they were some rare species of fish or fowl. \"You're\nup and about!\" John Gray finally barked.\n\"Certainly,\" sniffed the\nman. \"I cannot stay in bed indefinitely. I need to understand the whys and\nwhens and wherefores. Otherwise there\u2019s no reason for me to be here at all.\u201d\n\"Don't give me none of your\nforeign fancy talk!\" John Gray shouted. \"Not two hours ago you were a'burnin'\nup, on death's doorstep. Now here you are, healthy as a horse...\"\n\"Schr\u00f6dinger's Fever,\"\ninterrupted the stranger with a casual shrug. \u201cIt will continue to wax and wane\nfor some time. It is uncomfortable but harmless. Do not fret about it.\u201d\n\"Fret about your own self,\u201d\nreplied John Gray, neither knowing nor caring who Schr\u00f6dinger was, nor why the\npoor devil would have a malady named after him. \u201cAt least have the decency to\nput on proper clothes if you\u2019re a\u2019gonna wander about the house!\u201d\nUnderstanding dawned in the\nstranger's eyes. \"Ah. Dress code taboos,\" he muttered.\nTwenty minutes later,\nJohn Gray found himself in his kitchen, observing the stranger consume a\nheaping plate of Sally's cooking. It was like watching a dull plow being pulled\nby a drunk ox through a muddy field. The man was dressed again in his fancy,\noddly cut shirt and trousers, and both of his wrists were adorned with slim,\nsilver-white trinkets. He clutched knife and fork as if they were unfamiliar\ntools from some exotic trade, and fairly shoveled food into his mouth with\nwhichever implement struck his fancy at that instant, stopping only\noccasionally to chew or to offer Sally an encouraging smile.\n\"I feel ath if I\nhave not eathen in weeks,\" he lisped through a mouthful of potatoes.\n\"Days, at least,\" said\nMary, offering a cloth napkin. He stared at it in incomprehension until Sally\npantomimed the act of wiping his mouth. \"Ah,\" he said, \"Eating\nmorays and manners. Yes. Je comprends.\"\nSally stood and asked, \"Can I\nbrew you up some coffee, Mister...?\"\nThere was a pause. \"Mister?\"\nHe replied blankly.\n\"O for gosh sakes!\" John\nGray exploded. \"Your name, man! Why do you constantly make such a\nfearful fuss over the simplest questions?\"\n\"Of course,\" said the\nstranger, standing and bowing elegantly. \"I beg your pardon. My name is Raincross.\nSebastian T. Raincross, esquire.\"\n\"John Gray,\" replied the\nfarmer, standing and sticking out his hand. Sebastian T. Raincross looked down\nat the proffered hand and up again, puzzled.\n\"Shake his hand,\" said\nMary, her voice full of wonderment, as if she were instructing the man in the\noperation of his lungs or kidneys. Sebastian T. Raincross did as instructed,\nbut it was like no handshake ever shook in the state of Missouri. He gripped\nthe back of John Gray's proffered hand and proceeded to vibrate like a man in a\ncarriage going over rough terrain. The farmer snatched his hand from the\nstranger's grip as if it were red-hot.\n\"You're a queer one, ain't\nyou?\" he asked as the stranger dropped back into his chair.\n\"So I have been told,\"\nagreed Sebastian T. Raincross, liberally spearing ham with both fork and knife\nand putting both utensils into his mouth simultaneously. \"So,\" he\nsaid with a loud belch as he finished his meal, \"please explain why you are\nforbidding your daughter from bedding the young man of her choice.\"\nMary and Sally gasped.\nJohn Gray seized Sebastian Raincross by the front of his shirt, and screamed,\n\"You take that back! Ain't none of that ever gone on under this\nroof!\"\n\"Non, nyet, nem!\" shouted Raincross.\n\"I used an incorrect word. I meant to say... c'est quoi le maudit\nmot... wedding. Yes, that's it! Why will you not permit your daughter's\nwedding to the young man of her choice?\"\n\"Question ain't no better with\nthe right word,\" spat John Gray, releasing his grip on the stranger's\nshirt. Sebastian Raincross stumbled backwards a pace before he recovered his\nbalance.\n\u201cMy humblest apologies, I meant no\noffense,\" he muttered. This time, however, John Gray sensed something in\nthe stranger other than genteel befuddlement. There was now a hard look in his\neyes, and more than a hint of untruth and even menace in his words. John Gray\nshuddered. Bad enough to have a madman in the house, now he had gone and made\nhim angry.\nCHAPTER 4\nAnd so it went for almost six months.\nSebastian Raincross would experience brief oases of lucidity which alternated\nwith much longer periods of fever and delusional rambling. Dr. Hastings frankly\nadmitted his helplessness in the face of a malady that did not behave as a\nproper malady should, though Sebastian Raincross seemed unperturbed and settled\ncomfortably into the Gray household as if he were long-lost kin. Hints and even\noutright suggestions that he move along were neatly sidestepped, turned back\nupon themselves and finally, utterly ignored, often with the connivance of John\nGray's own wife and daughter. Without once opposing his wishes in word or deed,\nthey still managed to quietly delay and undo every eviction notice he decreed.\nJohn Gray was sorely vexed. Day by day\nhe felt the mastery of his household slipping from his grasp as the stranger\nplied his wife and daughter with fantastic tales and odd notions -- the word\n\"suffrage\" was being whispered less and less furtively, for one. John\nGray didn't know what it meant, but it sounded new and radical and dangerous.\nIn Missouri, men with dangerous ideas usually found themselves swinging from\ntrees. John Gray wanted no part of it.\nWorst of all, the mystery of\nSebastian Raincross did nothing to alleviate John Gray's original problem. Hugh\nGregory was handsome, kind and popular in Deer Lick, and his troubles with Dave\nGray already elicited considerable local sympathy. Inconsolable at the loss of\nhis love, Hugh slipped into a terrible melancholia. One night, after a particularly\nenthusiastic round of imbibing at the saloon, he declared publicly that the men\nof the Gray family were a race of monsters. \"I\u2019m better off!\u201d he slurred\nin a loud bellow. \u201cI don' need their p\u2019isen'd blood 'n my children!\"\n\"You take that back!\"\nboomed a loud voice from the back of the saloon.\n\"That goes double for me!\"\nbellowed a similar voice by the door.\nDave Gray staggered from the\ndarkened, smoky rear of the saloon. Big and bluff, his face was flushed with\ndrink and anger. He bit down on his foul-smelling cigar and stared pure hatred\nat Hugh Gregory. His older brother John Gray, still clear-eyed and ramrod\nstraight, stood by the front entrance, fists clenching and unclenching. A\nbemused and healthy Sebastian Raincross sat at the bar, surveying the unfolding\nscene like an enthusiast waiting for a wrestling match to begin.\nHugh Gregory laughed a bitter laugh.\n\"I see Beelzebub and Lucifer are on speaking terms once again.\"\nJohn and Dave Gray eyed each other\nand nodded, curtly. \"Call us what you will, we are still Grays,\"\nannounced John Gray, \"You done insulted the family name and we're callin'\nyou out.\"\n\u201cCome on the both of you!\u201d shouted\nHugh Gregory, slipping into a sloppy, two-fisted boxing stance. \"I can\nlick two sour old buggers like you with one hand tied behind my back!\"\n\"Fine by me,\" said Dave\nGray, rubbing his hands together in glee. \u201cLet\u2019s us take it outside.\u201d\n\"Two against one,\" cried a\nvoice from the back of the saloon. \"Is that what the Grays think are fair\nodds?\"\n\"He called it,\" replied\nDave Gray, staggering through the saloon gates. \"And we're just two sour\nold buggers, right? A strapping young fella oughta be able to lick us both with\none hand tied behind his back.\"\nJohn Gray found it strange that the\nthree men exited the saloon accompanied only by Sebastian Raincross. Too drunk\nand riled up to care, Hugh Gregory and Dave Gray staggered their way into a\ntiny alleyway between the blacksmith's shop and the general store. \"Come\non then!\" said Hugh Gregory as he dropped once again into a drunken\nimitation of a prizefighter's stance. \"Put up your dukes and fight!\"\n\"Yes, by all means fight,\"\nencouraged Sebastian Raincross. \u201cThis is all so horribly overdue.\u201d\n\"You stay out of this!\"\nroared John Gray again. \"You've been nothing but a thorn in my side since\nthe day you got here!\"\n\"I beg to differ,\" replied\nthe odd man, pointing at Dave Gray. \"I would say that he is your\nthorn. Perhaps he is the entire rose bush.\"\nDave Gray turned even\nredder than he was before. \"Are you looking for a thrashing too?\" he\ndemanded. \"Because when I'm done with this young pup I can break your head\ntoo, right and proper!\"\n\"I believe you could,\" said\nSebastian Raincross, and once again John Gray saw him transformed. His eyes\nwent cold and hard and they almost glinted with their own illumination in the\ndark alleyway. Suddenly, John Gray was afraid.\n\"Look here, people,\" he\nsaid hastily. \"Mebbe this has all been a big cock-up. What say we go back\nto the saloon and have a round on me?\"\n\"No,\" said Sebastian T. Raincross\nin tones of doom and finality. \"No, it all ends here. As it was supposed\nto.\"\n\"What d' you mean?\" asked\nHugh Gregory.\nNo answer ever came to Hugh Gregory\u2019s\nquestion. In fact, no one in Deer Lick was ever able to agree about what\nhappened next. The saloon crowd was still milling about in confusion, and some\nlater said they heard the sounds of flesh battering flesh and horrible cries\nfor mercy. Others reported a droning like a hive of angry bees or multiple\npopping noises like a thousand corks coming out of a thousand bottles of fancy\nFrench wine. When at last they warily entered the alleyway, they were greeted\nwith a bizarre spectacle.\nAll four men were on the ground, eyes\nclosed, limbs splayed this way and that. George Carver, the local veterinarian,\nwas first on the scene and immediately determined that John Gray, Hugh Gregory\nand Sebastian Raincross were still breathing. In fact, at the veterinarian\u2019s\nfirst touch, Sebastian Raincross sat bolt upright, an insolent smile playing\nbriefly across his features. When George Carver put his fingers on Dave Gray\u2019s\nneck, however, the color drained from his face.\n\"He ain\u2019t got a pulse,\" he\nsaid in sad resignation just as John Gray's eyes fluttered open. Instantly,\nmultiple cries of \"Murder!\" and \"Get the Sheriff!\" went up.\n\"Wha? Murder?\" grunted the\nfarmer as he staggered to his feet. \"Whose murder?\"\nThere was a moment of terrible silence\nas John Gray suddenly spied his brother\u2019s lifeless body, whereupon he turned to\nSebastian T. Raincross and bellowed, \"I hold you responsible for\nthis!\" Sebastian Raincross did not reply but merely shrugged in a helpless\nway.\nBefore John Gray could collect\nhimself to lunge at the strange man's throat, the Sheriff arrived. Fending off\na dozen people with a dozen different versions of the night's events, the\nlawman finally achieved a modicum of order by firing his pistol into the air.\n\"That's better!\" he said. \"Fer now, let\u2019s take the body to the\nundertaker...\"\nJohn seized the Sheriff's arm and\npointed balefully at Sebastian Raincross. \"Arrest that man, Sheriff!\u201d He\nshouted. \u201cHe killed my brother!\"\n\"What?\" exclaimed Hugh\nGregory groggily. \"Dave is dead?\"\n\"Yeah, and you killed him!\"\ncried out an anonymous voice from the crowd. \"Everybody knows you hated\nhim like p'isen!\"\n\"So did John!\" responded\nanother voice. \"They haven't talked in ten years!\"\nThe Sheriff took in the scene with an\nexasperated air. \"I can see this whole thing is going to get right\ncomplicated,\" he said. Waving at all three men, he turned to his deputy\nand ordered \"Arrest the lot of \u2018em! We'll sort it out in the\nmorning.\"\n\"No!\" shouted John Gray,\ngesticulating wildly at Sebastian Raincross. \"It's him, I tell you! Him!\"\nThe Sheriff let his hand casually\nfall near his holstered gun. \"So you say, John, but I say that murders\nusually happen among people what knows each other.\"\n\"If there's even been a\nmurder,\" added the veterinarian. \"I can't find a mark on him.\"\n\"Reckon that's why we got people\ndoctors and animal doctors,\" responded the Sheriff. \"We'll let a real\ndoctor take a look at him tomorrow. Until then, I don't want any more trouble\nfrom anyone! Understood?\"\nThe three men nodded, two more\nsullenly than the third, and followed the Sheriff to the local jailhouse. When\nthe deputy unlocked the single tiny jail cell, John Gray balked.\n\"I'm not going in there with \u2018em!\"\nhe said, planting his feet. \"They're both crazy men! My life wouldn't be\nworth a plugged nickel!\"\n\"You'll get in there and you'll like\nit!\" ordered the Sheriff. \"The next man to go whinin' and complainin'\ngets slapped in irons! Comprende?\"\n\"Comprendo,\" replied\nSebastian Raincross.\n\"Will you just shut your mouth\nfor Jesus' sake!\" yelled John Gray, as the Sheriff closed the cell door\nwith a clank and the screech of metal on metal.\nCHAPTER FIVE\nJohn Gray's life had never been easy,\nbut his night in Deer Lick's jailhouse was the worst in all his days. He dozed\nfitfully, cramped up on the cell's cold and dirty floor without so much as a\nblanket, trying to keep as far away as possible from his cellmates. Though the\ngood times he had shared with his brother were few enough and far between, John\nGray dreamed of them. He dreamed of the time he and Dave stole apples from the\nPomeroy Orchard and gorged themselves to sickness. He dreamed of the look of\njoy on Dave's face when he held his newborn niece in his arms and was told that\nhe was to be her godfather.\nJohn Gray awoke the next morning with\ntears on his face, and his younger brother's name on his lips.\n\"I'm sorry,\" came a quiet\nwhisper from behind him. John Gray turned, and found Sebastian Raincross\nobserving him. To his shock, the little man was also shedding tears, wiping\nthem away with the cuff of his odd shirt.\n\"What would you know about\nit?\" grunted the farmer.\n\"Everything,\" said the\nlittle man.\nBefore John Gray could frame a reply,\nthe Sheriff and his deputy entered the jailhouse. \"Okay Hugh,\" he\nshouted, \"wake up!\" With a moan, the young man rose from the floor of\nthe cell and looked around in confusion.\n\"Oh, my head,\" he groaned.\n\"Tell it to the distiller, I ain't\ninterested,\" said the Sheriff, unlocking the door. \"Out with\nyou.\"\n\"What about me?\" demanded\nJohn Gray.\n\"We're still looking into your\nbrother's death,\" said the Sheriff. \"We'll be letting you out one way\nor t'other, by and by.\"\n\"Then why are you letting Hugh\ngo?\" demanded John Gray. \"If I mighta done it, Hugh might have done\nit just as easy, and with better cause.\"\nFor a single brief moment, a look of\nconfusion crossed the Sheriff's face. He started to reply and then stopped, his\nmouth moving in perplexity with no sound issuing forth. An instant later, his\nexpression set itself again, cold and hard. \"I don't need no dirt farmer\ntelling me the law,\" he snapped.\n\"Don't you worry yourself,\nJohn,\" said Hugh Gregory in a nasty sing-song. \"I'll tell Mary and\nMother Sally that you're well.\"\n\"You stay away from my\ndaughter!\" John Gray shouted, his hands thrust desperately between the\nbars of the cell. \"Do you hear me, Hugh Gregory? Stay away from my\nMary!\"\n\"I hear you old man,\" Hugh\nGregory shot back over his shoulder as he exited the jailhouse. \"I'm just\nall done listenin'.\"\nJohn Gray sank to the cell's metal\nbench, his hands covering his face. \"Why me, Lord?\u201d\n\"Weren't you perfectly happy to\nhave Hugh Gregory wed your daughter six months ago?\" asked Sebastian Raincross.\n\"Poor Dave was right,\" said\nthe farmer, ignoring the odd man's question. \"The Gregory clan is pure p'isen.\"\n\"Is it the Gregorys who are\npoisoned, or you?\" asked the stranger.\nJohn Gray whirled on Sebastian Raincross,\nred fury in his eyes. \"Little man, you are pushing me too far. They can\nonly hang me once, for one murder or two!\"\n\"Don't be silly,\" said the\nstranger in his hard and dangerous voice. John Gray's heart skipped a beat and\nhe felt his fists unballing of their own volition. His hands fell to his sides\nand his red rage subsided into a kind of terrified calm. Turning away, he\nwhispered in a voice barely audible, \"Are you the devil?\"\n\"I'm afraid not,\" replied\nthe odd man. \"For that would be much easier on you.\"\nMary and Sally and Tom came to the\njailhouse later that day with Hugh Gregory. It was like no conversation John\nGray had ever had with members of his family, for he was not barking orders but\nlistening and pleading.\n\"Father,\" sobbed Mary into\nher handkerchief, \"how could you do it? We all know that Uncle Dave was a\ndisagreeable man, but to kill him in cold blood!\"\n\"Listen to me child, I would\nnever do such a thing! You must know that!\"\nIncredibly, Sally shook her head.\n\"I know no such thing, old father. You hated your brother like nothing\nelse, and maybe when you heard about his lies and treachery, you lost your\nhead.\"\n\"What lies? What treachery? Make\nsense, old woman!\"\n\"Don't play dumb, John,\"\nsaid Hugh Gregory. \"We all know that Dave told the padre tales about\nleaving his fortune to Mary, hoping that you'd hear about it and put a stop to\nour nuptuals! And it worked, old man, because he knew you cared about nobody\nand nothing except cold hard cash.\"\n\"He wasn't leaving Mary his\nmoney?\"\n\"Never,\" replied Hugh.\n\"All his money goes to his own son in Kansas City.\"\n\"Dave doesn't... didn't have no\nson,\u201d protested the farmer.\n\"That you knew about,\" said\nSebastian Raincross, from behind him.\nThe world swam about John Gray. He stumbled\nand half-fell to the floor, shaking off Sebastian Raincross\u2019 supporting hand.\n\"We've come to say goodbye, old\nfather,\" said Sally very matter-of-factly. \"Hugh and Mary are getting\nmarried and they're taking me and Tom east with them.\"\n\"NO!\" John Gray roared.\n\"Mary, I absolutely forbid this! You are not to marry Hugh or anyone\nwithout my permission!\"\nMary regarded him coolly through the\nbars of the jail cell door. \"My happiness may just be a matter of dollars\nand cents to you, father, but you do not own me.\"\n\"That's not true,\" wailed\nJohn Gray, \"I swear that's not true!\"\n\"It is, father. You know\nit in your heart.\"\nJohn Gray wept bitter tears and shook\nhis head slowly, back and forth. \"What's gotten into you, girl? What's\ngotten into all of you?\"\n\"The truth,\" said Mary,\nflicking her eyes over her father's shoulder at Sebastian Raincross. Without\nanother word she turned her back and marched purposefully from the jailhouse.\n\"So long John,\" said Hugh\nGregory. \"Good luck to you.\"\n\"Go to blazes,\" said John\nGray. \"And you too,\" he said, staring at his wife's familiar face.\n\"That's where I'm a\u2019comin\u2019\nfrom,\" Sally responded. \"Where I'm a' headed is another sort of\nquestion.\" And then they were gone, and John Gray was alone in his cell\nwith Sebastian Raincross.\n\"I'm ruined,\" whispered\nJohn Gray through his tears. \"Completely ruined.\"\n\"I'm afraid so,\" said\nSebastian Raincross, nodding sympathetically.\n\"Are they gonna hang me\nnow?\" John asked, looking up at the ridiculous, terrifying little man.\n\"Are you gonna do your hocus pocus and put me on trial? Shaw! Maybe we\njust skip the courthouse and go straight to the gallows!\"\nSebastian Raincross shook his head.\n\"No gallows, John. No trial. You'll just stay here for a little while\nuntil Mary and Hugh are safely married and away, and then it will all go away\nas if it had never happened.\"\n\"You are the devil,\"\nspat John Gray.\n\"No,\" replied Sebastian Raincross,\nshaking his head again. \"No, I'm just the Break Inspector, doing my job,\nas distasteful as it may be.\"\nJohn Gray snorted. \"There ain't no\nrailroad and no brakes within a hundred miles of here.\"\n\"B-R-E-A-K,\" said Sebastian\nRaincross. \"I inspect and fix breaks, not brakes.\"\n\"Make sense man,\" John Gray\nsaid. \"Breaks in what?\"\n\"In time.\"\n\u201cNo,\u201d said John Gray, shaking his\nhead. \u201cNot \u2018in time.\u2019 Tell me now!\u201d\n\"Do you know the word\n'vandal?'\" asked the odd little man. \"I'm very proud of myself, I\nlooked it up. A vandal is a miscreant or criminal who breaks things for no\napparent reason.\"\n\"Sounds like someone I\u2019m lookin\u2019\nat right now,\u201d replied John Gray.\nSebastian Raincross flinched and\ncleared his throat. \"In your great-great-great grandchildren's generation,\nthey will face another kind of vandal called a 'hacker.' Five generations later\nthe name will be 'fieldbaby,' and five generations after that, an 'enswarm.'\nFive times five times five generations after that, we will call them 'timebreakers.'\nIn the end, they are all the same: Immature, unconcerned with the general\nwelfare, ready to break things that do not belong to them for the sheer joy of\ndestruction. The only thing that ever changes is the scale of the destruction\nthey can wreak.\"\n\"My wife and my precious babies\nare gone,\u201d John Gray sobbed, \u201cand here you are, just yammering foolishness.\u201d\n\"Your brother was supposed\nto die, John,\" said Sebastian Raincross in a soothing, sympathetic tone,\n\"but it was on a different day in a different manner, back when he\ninsulted Hugh Gregory at the boarding house. Hugh was supposed to lose his\ntemper and come after Dave with his dander up and his fists raised, and Dave\nwas supposed to drop dead of a heart attack out of sheer fright.\"\n\"Dave wasn't afraid of nothing\nor nobody. You saw him at the saloon!\"\n\"Dave was afraid of everyone and\neverything when he was sober,\" replied the little man. \"Why do you\nthink he was such a mean cuss half the time and drunk the other half?\"\nJohn Gray continued to shake his head\nand mutter, \"not afraid of nobody and nothing.\"\n\"Dave was supposed to die that\nday, and the Sheriff was supposed to say that it was a sad deal but nobody's\nfault, and Mary and Hugh were supposed to get married four months later while\nyou played proud papa. You were never, ever, ever supposed to hear\nanything about Dave leaving his money to Mary. It was a lie and a wrongness and\na timebreak. It was a crime against you and every living thing in the\nworld.\"\n\"You're a madman,\" John\nGray repeated.\n\"I'm from the future,\"\nresponded Sebastian Raincross. \"From so far in the future that your age is\nmore remote and mysterious to us than the ancient Pyramid-builders are to you.\nThat may be why my manner seemed a little strange at first. Imagine how you\nwould have fared at dinner with the Pharaoh.\"\n\"You're a lunatic!\"\nscreamed John Gray. \"Nobody can travel back and forth in time like it was\na river!\"\n\"Your great-grandfather couldn't\ntravel on a steel rail at 40 miles per hour,\" said Sebastian Raincross.\n\"You can't fly through the air at one hundred miles per hour, but your\ngrandson will. He will be a great hero in a terrible war, an ace of the air. He\nmust be born. Him and his brothers and sisters and cousins. History requires\nthem, craves them, begs for them, and your stubbornness was strangling them all\nin their cradles.\"\n\"Are you saying that this is all\nmy fault?\u201d\n\"Vandals always look for the\nweakest link, John. A blank wall just crying out for vulgar graffiti, badly\nwritten code full of security holes, fieldvels with overlapping\nharmonics...\"\nJohn Gray sighed like a punctured\nbladder. \"\u2026And nasty old men who love money more than life itself?\"\nhe asked.\nSebastian Raincross nodded\nreluctantly. \"We protect the big and obvious places, John, but we can't be\neverywhere and everywhen. Sometimes they get past us. They look for backwater\ntowns and simple yes or no situations that can be swayed with a single change,\none kick at a can of cheap whitewash that defaces a precious work of art.\"\n\"So now you up and leave for\nyour wonderful home in the future and leave me here to rot?\"\n\"Oh dear no,\" said the\nlittle man, shaking his head. \u201cI have no home to return to. It was gone the\ninstant you had your conversation with the Reverend Hurley.\u201d\nJohn Gray scowled through his tears.\n\"I thought all the rack and ruin you visited upon me was to fix what was\nbroke.\"\n\"Fix,\" replied Sebastian Raincross,\n\"not restore. If a house burns down, and you build a replacement, is it\nthe same house? Even the most exact copy will have discrepancies. I will be\ngoing back to a world that will look something like the one I left, but the\nceiling beams and roof shingles will have been switched around. Those I love\nmay never have been born. The dwelling I live in may never have been built. A\ntyrant may rule my... my land, for want of a better word.\"\n\"Then why do it at all?\"\n\"Because the alternative was\nworse. Because time was broken and we needed to fix it before the bone set\nwrong. Before the whole human race was burned from the surface of the planet\nlike so many twigs in a bonfire.\u201d\nJohn Gray\u2019s head fell\ninto a position that almost looked like prayer. \u201cI\u2019m a simple, greedy, mean old\ncuss of a dirt farmer,\u201d he whispered in a voice almost too low to be heard. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t understand your fancy talk and your fancy ideas. But just tell me\u2026 Why do\nyou do it?\"\nSebastian Raincross sighed again. His\nown tone dropped to match John Gray\u2019s. \"I have... call them daughters,\nthough that is not exactly what they are, and they were the love of my life.\nBut I indulged them too much and did not watch over them properly and did not\nraise them with proper values, and they slipped away from me. They began to\nbreak things that did not belong to them.\"\nJohn Gray's eyes grew\nwide.\n\"In my world, if you leave a\nwarehouse unguarded or write security holes into your source code, you are just\nas responsible as the vandal for the vandalism that naturally results. I was a\nbad father to my not-daughters, and I have spent what seems like an eternity\ncleaning up after them.\"\nSebastian Raincross raised his arms\nand crossed them in front of his face. The silver-white trinkets on his wrists\ntouched with a clinking sound and began to glow, first red, then white.\n\"In fact,\" said Sebastian\nT. Raincross, \"that is exactly what I have done.\"\nAnd he was gone.","source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050727004221\/http:\/\/www.wouldthatitwere.com:80\/breakinspector.htm","source-hostname":"Would That It Were magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/CkWQD6IPfKKsH0f1ZKOO8bKSf3M.json","volume":5.0,"issues":3.0,"has_text":true}
