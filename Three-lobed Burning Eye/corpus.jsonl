Water sits in his cuttlebone, heavy like his conscience. He has chosen both, and both are what has brought him down here, alone, where the maintenance systems at the base of the city\u2019s towers hum endlessly.\nAmong the pepper dulse and the spiraled wrack, Casilo pauses at last, watching the fronds wave above him in the water and hoping for a miracle, that in the three days of postponement, some light will break through, shimmering blue and green on all their skin, and he will live, and he will live unburdened. Above and around him, the fronds sway black to brown to purple. The glimpse of an occasional wild animal; a hermit crab or sea lily. A free life beckons; outcast below or beyond the city, hunting shrimp for sustenance.\nDemocracy is responsibility and facing your decisions. Democracy is jet propulsion, up up up through the waters, a backwards motion, water through your syphon. Democracy is arms meeting with those of others, the reserved touch of acknowledgement, as you make your way back. They approach with questions or complaints or have a vague sense of Casilo\u2019s importance, and it draws them inwards like fish to a siphonophore\u2019s blinking light.\nCasilo commiserates, acknowledges, rarely argues. Yes, it does seem like they won\u2019t get the changes to the educational system they\u2019d hoped for, but please be assured he won\u2019t stop trying. He\u2019s sorry he didn\u2019t push harder on increasing energy generation, but when it came down to it the budgetary arguments were strong, and he felt the consensus reached was appropriate for now, hopes you will understand.\nBehind him, a familiar voice. The others dissipate, sensing that this is no longer a public space, that he is no longer available to them.\n\u201cHocsi\u2026\u201d Casilo\u2019s voice trails off. He sees her most days, and yet it is only now he notices her aging. The signs are subtle \u2014 tentacles with less tone than they once had, her color a shade or two paler, her eyes slightly cloudy \u2014 but they are unmistakably there.\n\u201cI came to find you. You haven\u2019t seemed yourself lately and, well, I was concerned. I hope you\u2019re not letting the job get to you too much.\u201d\nCasilo spreads his tentacles in front of him. When he closes his eyes he sees the color configurations of previous decisions spread out in front of him. He runs through the minutiae of political process in his apartment at night, unable to sleep.\n\u201cNot too much,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you know it can take a lot of focus at times.\u201d\n\u201cOh I know!\u201d Her laughter is only a subtle tone in her voice, dignified, professional, but Casilo recognizes it easily. \u201cBut it\u2019s still a job. A duty, certainly. A calling, perhaps. Don\u2019t forget that we do it to make this world better. Don\u2019t forget to enjoy that better world as you go. And I\u2019m always here if you need to talk about anything.\u201d\nCasilo acknowledges her with a swift, downwards motion. \u201cOf course. Thank you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow. Take care of yourself.\u201d\nAs she leaves, the others start to swarm back, but none of them mention the trench development, and that is Casilo\u2019s saving grace. He cannot think of the deep crack in the floor of the ocean, much less the proposals for energy development. He calls this day a write-off. Tomorrow he will catch up on correspondence, meet with constituents, and in the afternoon attend council where they will once again attempt to reach a consensus on rehabilitation and exile terms for lawbreakers. Tomorrow he will do his duty.\nToday, though, he swims into the tower that houses his apartment. Alone between the glass walls, he turns up the temperature a few notches, selects music and accompanying soft lights to flow through the water, swirling patterns all around him. He helps himself to a snack of spiced mussels. Some of the younger councilors say eating animals is wrong. He hopes he will never have to be embroiled in that debate.\nCome morning, the light is soft through the water. He listens to a new bulletin while preparing himself for the day. The trench development debate is on hold for three days, awaiting responses to questions about a report \u2014 a temporary reprieve, a prolonged pain. Today they will debate a trade agreement with the Vornwaters, south of here where ice may linger on the crest of a wave, and the seas below are warmed by great generators to reach habitable temperatures.\nCasilo looks through his notes, bright colors and patterns on the tablet he holds in front of him. It\u2019s a complicated proposal, not just a question of numbers but full of restrictions and requirements around disclosure of information and secrecy and competition, with knock-on effects to other agreements, at least one of which involves trade not with a region but with individual components \u2014 companies, they call them \u2014 who each produce something different.\nHe thanks the makers, and thanks his assistant, that he has clear summaries already prepared for him, along with notes detailing the likely impact on his constituents. He makes some comments of his own \u2014 questions he wants to ask. He has an idea which way he is likely to vote, but will listen to the arguments, knowing that achieving consensus is key.\nCasilo swims out to face the day\u2019s decision. This one, at least, he will survive.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe first time he used his veto, he was proud to do so, prepared to die even though only a genetic anomaly or undiagnosed condition would have led to such an extreme fate. Those were the days when they swam on the edge of war, when there was talk of expansion and invasions, and blockades were erected between buildings, great woven mats swaying in the current, protesters clinging on desperately. Those were the days when activists stained the waters around the council the blue-green of blood; thick blood, copper heavy, soon to be spilled \u2014 they said \u2014 in a battle only for waters that weren\u2019t needed, and weren\u2019t ours by rights.\nTheir tactics held some appeal for Casilo who was angry by this point, angry at how the public were being misled, at the devastation a war would cause, at the cynical motives of those who led the arguments for it. But, deep down, he knew such displays were not for him. He knew how the system worked, and he knew how to work within it \u2014 a talent carefully cultivated and long studied for.\nHe was the youngest member of the council, back then, one of few who had not vetoed before, and a small caucus met before the debate because it would be a waste for two to use it, a waste of precious life which was, after all, what they were here to preserve. Some warned him to think carefully before agreeing, but their relief was still evident. Even Hocsi\u2019s assurance that he could still back out, that no-one would think the less of him, were tinged with a confidence that this was how things were meant to unfold. Casilo knew better than to tell them he was willing to die for this, even though it was true \u2014 such statements could only add to their perceptions of his immaturity. Instead he offered in evidence his good health and an assessment that the risks were miniscule. They agreed.\nThe debate fluctuated black-brown-yellow. Many began glowing yellow, the color of opposition, announcing principles that would not be waved. Casilo was among them. They were criticized by those more experienced, and by the media, for disrespecting the consensus model, for failure to show openness to compromise. Cheers and jeers rippled through the water from the public gallery. Casilo could feel anxiety tightening his veins, the pressure of history. He opened his cells and the bursting of them flowed his body with relief, like a sore being lanced, a pressure valve opened. Warmth flooded through him, adrenaline surged. Everyone turned to look and there he was, red, red, red among the black and the brown and the yellow.\nDemocracy is red, when it needs to be. Red for an absolute, a block, a unilateral decision made necessarily rarely, which cannot be undone. Red among yells and screams, journalists pushing through with cameras and microphones, ignoring all regulations. Red still now as Hocsi sheltered him behind her, guiding him away, supporters moving to create a barrier.\nCasilo remembers little of what came next, but he remembers resigned voices, and a crowd of young people dancing in the water high above them.\nHe used the veto twice more. The next was, in retrospect, probably a mistake; he believed the cuts to educational funding were wrong, certainly, but such fluctuations in the budget were an everyday matter, part of the ebbs and flows of government. This time, there was some fairness in the comments about him being unwilling to compromise. But there are few councilors who have not used the veto mistakenly at one time or another, and most don\u2019t admit to their fault as readily. There is some pride in that.\nHe knew from the start that his third use of the veto was taking a risk. Though it is usually the fourth time that is fatal, such a consequence occurring earlier is far from unheard of. He took medical advice and they scraped away samples of his cells to measure the extent of the hemochromatosis \u2014 the disease that to some extent afflicted everyone who has used a veto, caused by a build-up of iron from the red dye throughout the body and particularly in his brain. They proclaimed him \u2014 with hefty disclaimers \u2014 in excellent health aside from that.\n\u201cHemochromatosis,\u201d the doctor said, \u201cshould be treatable by now, but unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. We can treat lead poisoning with chelation, and even mercury poisoning if we get to the patient soon enough, but for some reason any remedy for this remains elusive. I must ask what research is being done.\u201d\n\u201cI hope it is none,\u201d Casilo replied, discretely clutching the aching patch where cells had been removed. \u201cThe very foundations of our society are built on its existence.\u201d\nDespite the doctor\u2019s assessment, Casilo got his affairs in order, deleted some documents, both personal and professional, asked his cleaner to take out some accumulated junk \u2014 paintings that were never displayed, a broken seat, a box of empty jars \u2014 from his apartment.\nHe thought of persuading someone younger to use their veto \u2014 their first veto \u2014 instead, but this was a minority position and there were few who felt as strongly as he did. He could have pushed, and he saw little moral problem with doing so \u2014 he was not asking them to take a risk he had not himself taken. Yet he knew this was something he had to do. And there was no glory in it this time, the only adrenaline surge borne of fear and yet he knew, confidently, that he had done the right thing.\nAfterwards, avoiding the press, he swam to the apartment of an old friend, feeling an unusual sadness as he went. There they relieved their troubles with a (rare, expensive) solution of anemone known for its relaxant effect. They next day, he was back to normal, except for a sadness \u2014 perhaps psychological, perhaps related to the increased iron in his brain \u2014 which lingered and did not entirely go away.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHe has done none of these things. Time has rushed upon him.\nAnd the trench he will die to save is not worth dying for. There have been developments of other important sites, other beautiful areas of the ocean, and perhaps they were right and perhaps they were wrong, but people learned to live with them, forget, eventually, what those places were like before.\nThough his constituents wanted to save the trench, had campaigned fervently, they would be horrified if they knew was he was planning. They would implore him not to go ahead, insist \u2014 as he knew \u2014 that this was not worth dying for. But when he had surveyed them they had said their position on the proposed development was unwavering, that they could see no compromise.\nCasilo had thought of going there, one more time, as if it would help with his decision. He remembered the deep waters, the compression of his body, the pressure on his skin until it was almost exhilarating, a sense of achievement, a sense of the foreign. No-one could survive that deep unaided, but part way down there was a station that would rent you a capsule and a guide, and within the lower pressure of the transparent sphere you would begin to relax again as you descended, moving downwards through a cloud of amphipods, pale and glowing in the light of your capsule.\nThere are animals down there that have not been found anywhere else. You might see echinoderms \u2014 sea cucumbers and the pink sea pigs with their short tentacles. Then come spoon words, lizard fish, anemones and soft coral. More colors than Casilo\u2019s kind could ever be, more than they usually saw in nature.\nIt would be true to say that his visits to the trench had had an impact on Casilo, and it would be a shame for it to be destroyed. He understood, too, why his constituency cared when so many others did not. The Alumni Association of the School of Biological Exploration had voted, en masse, to join the constituency. At a far higher rate than the rest of the population, they had been there. They knew what was at stake.\nBut Casilo will not do this for the echinoderms, spoon worms, lizard fish, anemones and soft coral. He will not do it for the shock of magenta and the moving shoals of orange, for the fact it is unique, exists nowhere else, cannot be replicated.\nHe will do this for democracy, because democracy is his life. Because democracy itself is more important than the decisions made and outcomes achieved.\nHe has sworn to represent his constituents, and today he will do just that.\nHe barely hears the arguments, the forceful yeses and the soft nos. Discussion of cost and alternatives, of timescale, talk of the immediate needs of our growing civilization. Have they \u2014 any of them \u2014 noticed his nerves, the subtle, anxious shifts in color, the tremors running down his tentacles?\nCasilo sucks in oxygen, grasps his arms and tentacles together. The sacs of pigment burst open, they flow through his body. It does not feel like poison. It feels like a choice. The shouts below him are loud and yet muffled, as if he were travelling far away, and he cannot distinguish a single word from them. The redness reaches the ends of his tentacles, covers him completely, and he begins to float upwards, up to the pale light.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue32\/3lbe32_story5.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"Democracy shades black-brown-yellow, is iridescent, buoyed up on reflective cells: guanophores and leucophores.

The priyayi invented a family for her, a history, a line as long and illustrious as the line of any courtier.\nIn other words, they lied through their teeth. It was only twenty years ago that they and the Rajah\u2019s mothers, the old queens, blazed into orbit in search of blood and conquest. The Poison Court I had built for them was so new it shone like a jewel, repelling the jungle vines with its lapidary sparkle, and none of its stones had cracked.\nThe Roro was gold all over, her face too masked in gold. Beneath her raiment there was no living flesh to be seen. The priyayi whispered that her skin was dead. That her skin was like the craquelure ceramics imported from faraway Fifth Kiln, green as celadon.\nAnd between the cracks? Void. Dust. Stars.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI said I saw through her. \u201cI put it to you,\u201d I said, \u201cthat you are a dark star.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d the Roro said. \u201cI put it to you, stonemason, that I am the princess you bricked up alive when your rajah no longer had use for her.\u201d\nThe Roro shrugged as if to say it didn\u2019t matter. After all, I was holding my mother\u2019s chisel. She pushed her shining golden breast against the chisel\u2019s edge.\n\u201cIf you say I am a star, then strike me,\u201d she said.\nI had set my mother\u2019s chisel into stranger rocks on this telluric planet, but I was loath to set any chisel into the Roro. I knew her heart was hungry and that it would pull me in.\n\u201cStonemason,\u201d the Roro said. \u201cAre you afraid of me?\u201d\nIn answer, I took her hot heavy hand.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSuhita died standing, a victim of the petrifying disease that plagues her people. Soft-eyed Asmara, grower of vines, followed. Of her own will, it was proclaimed, she drank poison and curled up at the feet of her statue lover, and virtuous widows would do well to follow her example.\nThe priyayi are liars. I say so, though no one heeds me: who would believe a kasar? The last kasar on the planet, driven mad by grief, whispering her secrets to the unhearing stones.\nI told the truth to the Roro, who bent her stiff golden ear to me.\n\u201cAsmara stumbled over a loose stone,\u201d I said. \u201cFell to her knees. The Rajah made certain to misinterpret the gesture.\u201d\nHe guided the cup to her lips himself, our Poison King. Filial to the last.\n\u201cWould you like to go inside?\u201d\nThe Roro laughed. \u201cYou won\u2019t get me that way again.\u201d\nArm in arm we walked to my hovel.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nNight fell. I lay with her. I kissed her golden mouth.\n\u201cWhy me?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cWe kasar must make do with each other,\u201d the Roro answered. I perceived it was a joke. We the raw, we the unrefined. The stonemason and the untapped star.\nIn my bed, the Roro was heavy, hard to turn. Her irradiated limbs trailed glowing dust over mine.\n\u201cI\u2019m your mother\u2019s age,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI could be your mother.\u201d\n\u201cMy mother,\u201d I whispered back, \u201cis dead.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI dined. The Roro did not. Under her black quartz gaze I wiped my dripping mouth.\n\u201cWalk with me in my garden,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYour garden will wither in my wake,\u201d the Roro warned. Was she worried for me? At the corner of her mask, I noticed a crack.\n\u201cIt is not,\u201d I reassured her, \u201cthat sort of garden.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIgnoring me, the Rajah spoke the language of the priyayi, where polish is prized. \u201cBright star,\u201d he began, \u201cbright jewel\u2026\u201d\nHe never finished. He had noticed Queen Suhita.\n\u201cIt is her likeness,\u201d he said, unnerved, \u201cher exact likeness.\u201d\nThen he gasped. His other mother, Asmara, lay huddled at Suhita\u2019s feet, malachite flashing in her dry dead veins. Her lips flecked with mica. Her stone eyes bulging.\nI had built the old queens\u2019 tomb, that much is true. But the night Suhita and Asmara were said to have been sealed away, I unlaid the bricks. I stole them from their rest. I anchored them in my garden, mouths open to the sky.\nThe Rajah cried out and fled. We watched him, a silken cyclone whirling toward the Poison Court: still gasping, still crying out; now limping, now dragging his leg. His heavy travertine leg.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cHe is poisoning you,\u201d she said. \u201cI tasted it in your kiss.\u201d\nCracks were multiplying over her mask, one creeping tendril after another.\nI nodded. \u201cThe way he poisoned his mother. And mine. And when I am gone, he thinks, he will be free, free at last, from stone and stonemasons.\u201d\nBut the Rajah forgets: I built his Poison Court. His Court, his cage. I am immune to its every toxin. And when his mother\u2019s curse has petrified him and the Rajah stands stone dead, I will set him atop a plinth, and I will shape him.\n\u201cI see that I need not have come,\u201d the Roro said. \u201cThe dark star struck long ago. It fell to this world and was planted, and took root like a jungle vine.\u201d\nOur orbit had returned us to the tomb of the old queens.\n\u201cIs there anything inside?\u201d\nThe Roro\u2019s mask was falling away. I saw her starved green face, the nebulae of capillaries burst by her screams to be set free. I saw her sockets, her snarling alabaster teeth. I saw eternity.\n\u201cVoid,\u201d I said. \u201cDust. Stars.

Both his cows had gone dry, udders swollen and eyes downcast, considering even the grass treacherous. He would have glared at anyone, she told herself.\n\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d her father asked.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d she replied. Everyone in Sumara had been glum for a fortnight, weighed down by suspicion and fear, growing eyes on the back of their heads, smearing turmeric over their foreheads, and taking nimble footsteps. It was not customary for the men to be quiet, but that\u2019s how things had changed in the village of Sumara.\n\u201cHere, have some milk,\u201d her father said. A hint of rose; a pink froth on the surface.\nShe thought of Arappa while she sipped from the glass. \u201cSomething is happening, isn\u2019t it, appa? I have never seen Baru anna\u2019s forge so crowded before.\u201d\nA shake of the head. \u201cFocus on what you\u2019re taught at the grove,\u201d he replied. They were standing in their backyard, where the grass tickled her ankles.\n\u201cBut Eranu thinks I ought to get my own sword,\u201d Maya argued. A twitch in her father\u2019s lip. Perhaps it was the wind. He turned his face the other way, toward the forest where the leaves swayed, the branches drooped in clusters to form hideous gates leading into darkness, and the fragrance of the alinyas beckoned her.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMunivar lashed him before picking him up by the shirt collar. \u201cSumara is safe, remember that. The alinyas, bless their crimson souls, protect us as do the deep roots.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re just dogs,\u201d Eranu chuckled, one eyebrow raised cocksure.\nMunivar slapped him again but refrained from the topic any further. For the rest of the class, there were murmurs among the students. Even Maya, who usually sat at the back, crawled forward to hear the gossip from the village.\nJuwala-dhanu and Pimri had clearly been more fortunate in their arguments with their fathers, for even their looks, by the end of the day, had descended into that pallor that had plagued the rest of Sumara.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cCome with me,\u201d her father said to Maya that night.\nThey walked to the edge of the forest, where the hollow clicks of midnight were the loudest. They shared a torch until she realized she didn\u2019t need one. The darkness had a clarity in her eyes, shades of black and poison green, which until then, she could swear she had lacked. They wandered a mile inside. Teaks gave way to cedars and oaks. The crevices in the barks became more prominent, and the smell of woodsmoke from the hunters\u2019 dead fires gripped her senses. What did they hunt? The undergrowth grew soft, the air thick and wet, and the birds whispered their songs like secrets exchanged across the highest branches.\nHer father stopped next to a tall cedar. \u201cClimb,\u201d he said.\nMaya craned her neck to look up, through the canopy of leaves at the brightly spotted, black canvas. The moon frolicked aimlessly to the west, its light fell on the forest floor in freckles and scars. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy do you want me to?\u201d\n\u201cThis is what your mother would have wanted,\u201d he said, a saint-like expression on his face. It was a compelling argument; it would have made her do anything.\nThe bark was wet and flaky against her skin, with knots like wobbly knees, and oozed sap onto her hands as she climbed. Her limbs snuck into the gashes like pieces of a puzzle, her body moved back and forth and up and up and up until, when she gazed down, her father\u2019s face looked sculpted, surrounded by a grizzled mane, gleaming in the torchlight; he was smiling.\n\u201cYou did well,\u201d he told Maya later that night, as he tucked her into bed and slept the other way. She hugged his knees for comfort, afraid to ask him any questions.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMaya believed him a little. That evening she asked Father. \u201cIs it really the end of the world beyond the forest?\u201d She sipped the milk. Rose red, darker than the previous time. The smell of what moans alone.\nHe nodded only half-heartedly, as though he had never seen it himself. \u201cThe world is a big place,\u201d he replied, \u201cand they say what is the end of one is the beginning of the other.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhen he left, Maya took her sling, her pouch of stones and a torch, and surreptitiously crept out to the forest. The sun was a reddish afterglow, pulling the mountains over it like a blanket.\nThe forest was dark inside, indifferent to the dusk beyond. The fragrance of the alinyas was faint, but Maya smelled it grow stronger with each step. Shadows lurked behind trees, coming forth when the moonlight pierced the leafcover. Old oaks, birches and teaks snuggled next to each other, the wind flitting between them, playing catch with her in hisses and hollow swirls. Twigs crushed under her feet. She only followed the scent; a sister\u2019s calling.\nAn hour into the forest, she realized she had forgotten to light the torch. Her eyes borrowed the light hidden beyond the leaves above. She stood in a small clearing, and as dew drops splashed on her palm, she wondered why she didn\u2019t feel cold.\nThe silence broke to her left.\nThe alinya ambled from behind a great bush, nettles amidst coppices of oak. Larger than a dog, covered in silver fur, its forehead a mass of glowing flesh, and narrow eyes with that crimson glint that cut the darkness of the heart of the forest. It wrapped its long tail around a branch overhead, the orbed end radiated with clarity, shaming the moon for its cowardice in these parts. Others came. Three, four. They descended from trunks or slipped out of burrows. And they all moaned.\nIt was a calling, Maya realized.\nShe followed them deeper into the thickets, the clearing a forgotten oasis. Her breathing steadied, her eyes dimmed to absorb the light of the alinyas\u2019 tails and the miasmic glow on their foreheads. They led her down a slope scattered with trees and shrubs to a valley that smelled of them entirely.\nThere, in the middle of a clearing, under a great slab of rock in a pit, lay the wounded one. Its forehead sliced open and the hollow cavity within made her retch. Beside the pit with the wounded one was a fresh grave just as deep, carved with shivering limbs by the alinyas, sealed with teardrops and immortalized with their cries. When she looked around, she noticed other graves, a dozen or more mounds swollen with the flesh of dead alinyas.\nMaya\u2019s hand felt the underside of the rock, fingers curling over rough edges. Her muscles caved to her will. A gentle tug was enough. She lifted the rock as easily as it were a pebble and cast it aside. The alinyas moaned louder, snuck around her and into the pit, pulling out the wounded one, and licking the ooze off its forehead until its breathing ceased. They dragged the alinya into the grave, into its final resting place. The smell was familiar to Maya, but she could not name it.\nShe sat and hugged her knees and looked at the dead one. She looked at the four that lived.\nThe light from their tails illuminated the tallest tree in the clearing, the one Eranu claimed to be at the heart of the forest. Maya stood, gathered her belongings, and went to it. The tree rose like a great tower to pierce the sky. Her fingers felt the raw timber of the trunk, like people huddled together under a great umbrella, their limbs interwoven, and flesh sewn into the roots of the valley.\nWhen she climbed, she did not look down.\nWhen you reach the top, do not attempt to pluck the moon, her father had said. Instead, she looked all around her: at the new floor of treetops under her, at the expanse of the forest stretching to the silhouette of mountains in the distance. The sound of water, the bristle of leaves, the sky curving to clasp the horizon, sending its army of stars as gifts. Eranu was not wrong, but he was also not right. This was not the end of the world. This was only the end of theirs.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cWhere did you go today?\u201d her father asked Maya once she had returned.\n\u201cTo do what mother would have wanted me to,\u201d she replied.\nShe was too exhausted to tell what she had witnessed in the forest. Images played in her head. Visions appeared in consciousness. Her strength faded like an illusion, reducing her to a child. The alinyas came in her dreams, transforming them into nightmares, until, when she woke, her father sat beside her, a look of worry on his face.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not well,\u201d he said, observing the sweat glistening her forehead. \u201cTake rest. I\u2019ve fed the crows. And if it\u2019s what you want, do not go to the grove today. I will speak to Munivar.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be alright. If I don\u2019t feel well, I\u2019ll come back.\u201d\nHer father nodded. \u201cHave this milk before you leave then.\u201d\nShe drank reluctantly. It tasted of honeyed petals and salt, and dark red as the blood bubbling out of a thorn\u2019s prick.\n\u201cWhat is happening in the village?\u201d Maya asked him. Just one question, she told herself. Instinctively, she snatched a fly by its wing in candlelight and brought it close to her eyes. Something in its webbed eyes made her let it go.\nHer father took a deep breath. \u201cNothing to worry about,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Empire promises to protect all its lands, even the farthest ones. Remember what Munivar says. Learn everything that he teaches. Wisdom is man\u2019s greatest weapon.\u201d\n\u201cThen why is everyone making swords at the forge?\u201d she asked.\nHe ruffled her hair, urging her to drink faster. \u201cMaybe I can come to the council\u2019s meeting with you today, after the grove,\u201d she offered.\nIt was her father\u2019s turn to be reluctant. He had invited her yesterday, but today was different.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAt the grove, Munivar paced the grass restlessly. He taught them the history of the Empire and how to count beyond fifteen. Eranu was the first to interrupt him. \u201cHow much time do you think we have?\u201d\nMunivar stopped pacing and shot a sharp look at him. \u201cYou\u2019re all fools,\u201d he snarled. \u201cSumara cannot be found. It is a baseless fear. Even the Emperor is not privileged to drink of the forest\u2019s water without our permission. We needn\u2019t invite ourselves to this carnage. We sit at the edge of the world, under the shield of the infinite forest. Trust the lore, boy, and no harm shall befall us. Now,\u201d Munivar narrowed his eyes, \u201cI want to meet your father before you go planting more ideas in the other children\u2019s heads, do you hear me?\u201d\nEranu shrugged and winked in Maya\u2019s direction. \u201cThere are roads, you know. And caves dug through the mountains. And monsters to walk across them.\u201d\nMaya was not one to forget such untamed conversations, however. When she made her way to the council meeting, it was with an unsettled head, a vacillation between nightmares and memories she knew she would have to cast aside.\nIn the grotto, she sat by a blazing sconce, fanning her fingers over the flame, trying to remember what it was to feel the sting of the fire. Over a dozen men and women sat in the chamber, their eyes sleepless, clouds sprawled underneath them.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not for the rain we pay the taxes,\u201d one of them said. \u201cWhat is the purpose of them eating our crops if we don\u2019t get arms when we need them?\u201d\nOne guffawed. \u201cRumor is that the man who sends the soldiers is as dead as the man who collects our taxes,\u201d another offered. \u201cWe have only two choices: we either leave through the forest, hoping that the end of the world is a soft and kind place, or we stay here and watch the blood seep out of our bodies.\u201d\nHer father sat quietly on one of the gunnies, chin resting on his knuckles, his eyes shifting between the occupants of the grotto before finally landing on his daughter. \u201cWe fight,\u201d he said. \u201cThe forest holds no reward for us. It is only for those born in it.\u201d\n\u201cHear, hear,\u201d a few murmured. \u201cBless the alinyas, and the roots they feast on. And there bloody be some worth for that wall we built.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d Maya replied. \u201cYou have something on your hands.\u201d\nThe dark on his hands rebuked the candlelight. He slid to the floor and slept all night leaned against the door, his snoring filled the air with the groan of his sins.\nA day passed and then two. The shadows of the hills were thought to be poisoned. As though something lurking beyond it had intruded in that sacred land which even Emperors were forbidden from trespassing.\nBajuna and Khumarao erected two more watchtowers, but there was no sight of the Empire\u2019s shields marching toward Sumara; no hint of aid. As Maya stood by her door, sipping on the milk the color of strawberries, her father laid a hand on her shoulder. \u201cA sword is like the fly whose wing you caught,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly this time, don\u2019t let it go.\u201d\n\u201cAppa,\u201d Maya replied. \u201cAm I what my mother would have wanted me to be?\u201d\n\u201cYour mother wanted you to live.\u201d\n\u201cThen spare the last alinya,\u201d she begged, for she knew what he had done.\nHer father stared at her, his words lost. His knees failed him, and he sank, holding the frame of the door, before grabbing her hand. His strength paled in comparison to hers.\n\u201cThe alinya is a beautiful thing, appa. It is what we pray to. The enemy cannot find us while the alinya lives. You told me to listen to Munivar. So, I\u2019m doing that. Please.\u201d\nHer father smiled and cupped her chin. \u201cWe always had a weakness for myths. The hordes are beyond that hill, child. Or maybe under it already. It is time to stand for who we are.\u201d\nMaya brushed his hand away and, shoving him through the door, ran. Away, through the gate, over the low fence between bamboo pikes that separated her house from Araapa, his poultry and his crank, and toward the bulk of the trees that burst out of the earth to form the mouth of the forest.\nShe did not stop; she didn\u2019t need to. Her body retched out the fatigue like something distasteful, making her endure the terrain, own it. The woods had always been her true home, the undergrowth a soft silken carpet, the shadows of the trees insignificant to her in front of the aroma of the wood and the flowers blooming where the leafcover bowed to reveal the sky. She drank from the water that sparkled in the brooks flowing down the slope. Each step mimicked a forgotten memory, each broken twig a former life she glimpsed in fleeting images. She wove herself around and between the trees, ensnaring what always ensnares, darkening what always darkens.\nWhen she reached the mystical clearing, she followed the trail of the alinya, sniffing the footprints, dogging their voices left on the rims of the leaves and their paw marks on the trunks.\nUnder the shadow of the tallest tree, Maya knelt and watched the last of the alinyas breathe like Maya\u2019s mother had breathed on a bed surrounded by candles, her rattles shaking something deep within herself. The alinya gasped a final breath. Its crimson eyes waned to colorless gray. The light on its tail flared brightly for one moment that begged forever, before the beast fell into stillness, all its brilliance fading, its face shrouded by the blood flowing from its injured forehead. The blood Maya had drunk the previous night, and so many nights before.\nTwo instead of one. Her father had betrayed her in his desperation. Maya cried until the sun feared the endlessness of her tears and scurried behind the mountains, leaving behind an orange hue to placate her anger. The forest grew silent. A silence of a guardian abandoning its duty.\nMaya buried the alinya and marked its grave with her blood.\nAs she stumbled out of the forest, she saw fires on the thatches of the watchtowers, heard the screams from a distance. She snuck around the village to the far gate and scurried into her home from the backdoor, the night now as bright with flame as a summer noon. She packed bread and the balls of rice tied in coriander leaves and stuffed it within her clothes.\nThe strangers arrived at the village with glinting axes and spiked helms. They spoke a tongue that did not require to be understood. Hate burned in their eyes.\nShe could not find her father among the screaming or stilled faces. In the thick of the battle, everyone looked the same. Eranu, Munivar, Araapa, and the rest of the village men who had walked out of Baru anna\u2019s forge like brave pretenders, with swords in their wobbling hands. Now all faces meshed into one until the blood dried.\nMaya picked up a sword lying on the ground and sliced her way through the horde, undeterred, unhurt and unchallenged. The spirit of the alinyas coursed through her blood. The bodies did not bother her anymore. Not Eranu\u2019s, Araapa\u2019s, anyone\u2019s.\nNot even her father\u2019s.\nShe spotted the one who was pointing fingers and issuing orders, seated on a black horse, on a saddle of pelt and bones. A wolf stood by him, its eyes scanning the falling populace with a measured growl.\nIt had been the last sip of red milk before Maya left for the forest that now gave her the courage to approach the rider and his wolf with her fear abandoned. It was what made her angry. \u201cCome here, little one,\u201d said the voice. The wolf howled.\nShe took a step closer. Made her stance a few feet away, her sword aloft and gleaming.\n\u201cThey say this is the end of the world,\u201d the voice continued. \u201cIs it true?\u201d\nMaya did not reply. Only waited until the wolf, sensing her intention, stepped forward to stand between her and its master. Blood dripped from its teeth, and as it opened its mouth wide, she screamed the sound of what lay hidden inside her.\nHer breath was a storm; her eyes a punishment for those who lingered around her.\nThe wolf staggered. It turned around and ran, bouncing over corpses and flesh, until it bore a hide a darker shade than the night around and disappeared.\nMaya watched the rider regard her from his towering steed, staring down at her small frame and tilted expression covered in blood. When his ride would not advance, he dismounted and pounded toward her, drawing his blade. She felt his eyes on her, his intent, and finally his rage. He took two great strides ahead to bring down his sword upon her. Maya parried his effort with her own, the clang of steel ringing in her ears. Her scream pulsed from her, entered his veins and weakened the mettle of his bones and their shape altogether. In that instant, the sword slipped from his hand, betraying him when he had demanded its loyalty the most. He cowered and fell on his knees, until his heart stopped at Maya\u2019s sight and her strength.\nWhen he died, Maya saw the clouds of smoke reflected in his eyes. Only a remnant of her strength left, she suppressed her tears, turned and fled. Not outside, but to the heart of the village, where in the middle of the square there grew a banyan tree. She climbed it like her mother would have wanted her to, and lay amid the leaves and branches, shivering and hugging her knees. And she cried. For her father, for her friends, for everyone who now lay beneath her.\nIt was morning when she came down. The village was empty save for the stench of rot and blood, and a handful of survivors.\nMunivar alone saw her leave the village. He hobbled toward her, calling her name in the feeble light of dawn. He leaned on a cane, face withered and unapologetic, and offered to travel with her. There was always pride in being proved right, she knew, and no count of corpses was going to dissuade Munivar from showing it on his face.\n\u201cWhere do we go?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe\u2019re at the end of the world.\u201d\n\u201cThen we turn the world on its head,\u201d he croaked. \u201cAnd go inside it. Come, let me tell you about this other forest I know, and the beast it harbors.\u201d","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue31\/3lbe31_story3.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"Father slept with his head beside Maya's feet, his arm across her knees, the woolen of his thigh a second pillow for her.

It was the first art form, and it is the last, in the white figures of the skeletons we leave after death.\nMy journey continues. The ship roars, and not only does it roar. Its systems are modelled on the behaviors of a Bengal tigress, the trip accompanied by amorous yowls, huffs and gurrs, yaps and trills.\nIt circles the Moon as if inspecting its defences, then leaps in for the kill. I share its zeal.\nHere is the old city, straddling the Ten Bruggencate crater, a building of size. It is the image of the Ass as imagined by Zarathustra: white its color, its food spiritual, three the number of its legs (great pylons lifting it above the lunar regolith), many the number of its eyes.\nAnd five the number of its caretaking staff. Young men and women, helping me through the complicated entry locks after landing.\nThese caretakers have done their best, but the city has an air of abandonment. Once, I know, it housed many hundreds of people. I think of the old, oft-repeated gag in cartoons set in the Wild West \u2014 Tex Avery? Friz Freleng? \u2014 where the population counter on the city-limits sign drops by ones and twos whenever a gunfight sounds in town.\nMy guides lead me deeper in. More abandonment. The city was empty for eighteen months before Naveen came here.\nLa, five years of solitude. How must that have been for him?\nThen, suddenly, silently, near the beginning of his sixth year here, the population counter returned to zero.\nNo corpse was found, no sign of mishap.\nNaveen Mritak, national treasure. An artist as universal, as fundamental as Lautrec, Picasso, Tagore \u2014 a name whose recollection comes so easily it does not feel like recollection.\nAnd now he was simply \u2026 gone.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nNaveen was Hindu, while I am an irreligious man of the Hindu sort; the city, however, is Muslim, as are my guides. They are Malays, trim, quietly elegant people. I remember a book of my father\u2019s \u2014 The World and South-East Asia \u2014 giving by its title a glimpse into the Western worldview. I recall it for the otherworldly quality of these Malays, their composure, their eerily impeccable manners. If God exists, it is among the social graces of the Islamic tradition \u2026 and now, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar \u2014 more doors; passing a walled-off distraint leased to a totalisator agency, clamped onto the infrastructure like a laptop bum nursing a three-hour latte in a Wi-Fi caf\u00e9.\nI walk on, guided by the Malays. There is little talk. I resist asking my guides about G. W. Pon Rijiju, who preceded me here. I hear that his physicians have expressed cautious optimism about his recovery. He is a fine critic, an excellent writer. I wish him well.\nAllahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, and a door opens onto the conservatory, the florest, so called, which surrounds Naveen\u2019s studio as a briary wood does a bewitched castle.\nThe architecture is faintly religious, the stained glass crazed and smeared \u2014 no, not glass, I remind myself, but vitrified regolith raised from the base of the crater. Colors more ancient than the idea of churches.\nWe push on, through whin and grease and wormy marl, the sunflowers groaning, their muscular trunks growing audibly. They seem animal to me, and male, regardless of gender \u2014 hijras \u2014 burly transvestites in too-bright dress \u2014 and tall, as such ladies often are, some thrusting their heads entirely through the panes of the ceiling. I hear the kettlewhistle of escaping air (I am assured there is no danger). I look outside, and see, through the smeared panes, other flowers growing in the lunar soil.\nVacuum-adapted, faintly darkmattered, touched by Naveen\u2019s art, their faces upturned to offer the simple mathematics of their floret-arrangements to the void.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMy protective gear is assembled, an elaboration of boxes, a gee-suit. It is as big as a Portaloo, and as charming, and the sleeves are like paired filing cabinets \u2014 open a drawer and look under F for my fingers. Last is the enormous bungalow of a helmet, gabled with buffers and sensors.\nReady, I am ready. I wait, wondering if G. W. Pon Rijiju wore this very suit.\nAllahu Akbar croaks the big plugdoor. I do not hesitate, but totter through: Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar \u2026 the door shuts behind me.\nI am in the final studio of Naveen Mritak.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nTwigs and shards and Fun Chum softdrink cans in the village of his birth; the rubbish and e-waste in Lucknow. Later, the extraterracotta pottery; the spirals secretly induced into the circumambulations of the Mecca Hajj pilgrims; his use of living birds as paint brushes, and as paint, their colors transferring directly across to the canvas\u2026\nAnd in the end, darkmatter.\nThere is an industrial aesthetic to the studio, which was originally built by a defense paracontractor out of Chhatarpur. I see fat plesiosaurs of cabling, bulky apparatus, rows of field-governors, aligned with the Moon\u2019s magnetic field like yttrium termitaria, maintaining the darkmatter at proper density.\nI totter forward in my suit (so difficult, like trying to move a fridge from the inside!), feeling the pull of the art.\nThere is enough darkmatter here to enspiral Scutum\u2013Centaurus Arm of the Milky Way.\nMy suit protects me against the gravitic effects. It offers no protection against the art.\nAll at once I am \u2026 ravished. I did not expect this. I am devastated.\nThis is the material whose existence for a long while astronomers could only infer. And in truth, I can only infer its existence here.\nBut that it cannot be seen is of no consequence. This is Naveen Mritak\u2019s genius, the insight he shares with me now.\nDoes darkmatter need to be visible to shape the constellations? Does art need to be visible to shape the sensibilities?\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIt was an earlier time, his Uttar Pradesh a different Uttar Pradesh. The swindle was common then: an official bribed, a false death notice filled out, the property of the \u2018deceased\u2019 inherited by his \u2018murderer\u2019.\nA shameful practice, and so widespread that its victims formed a lobby group, the Association of Dead People. But their victories were few. Death is a valve allowing passage in one direction only. I have written two books on Naveen. In my first, I give account of his visit to the Azamgarh District Consolidation Department, where he hoped to have his death notice reversed. Thoo! The tortured complexities of the Consolidation Department were such that the demons of the labyrinths of the Lower Hells could but look on in bewildered awe!\nPoor Mritak, everything lost, everything gone; abandoning his home, his home no longer. He travelled to Lucknow (an inappositely named city!), hometown of his closest living relative, his paternal grandfather, called Grandfather Bunny.\nI have been to Lucknow: the chaat stalls and tiffin carriers, the filmi music whining like dentists\u2019 drills, the gated international community, the shanties of corrugated iron and packing crate timber, with glimpses of the planetary ships beyond, the city booming and lashing around them.\nI found, as Naveen did, his grandfather\u2019s rooming house. I saw the entrance he passed through, walking to the remembered apartment.\nI have written of him knocking at his grandfather\u2019s door. It was answered by a woman, or a hijra, to be more specific, her dress patterned with sunflowers.\nBy her, Naveen learned that Grandfather Bunny was no longer about. He had moved, she said. He had come into money, she said.\nIt was the beginning of Naveen\u2019s understanding that where he had hoped for salvation, he had discovered his murderer instead.\nAdventures followed, not necessary to relate here. The city spun, it tilted, it spat Naveen out upon the Saadatganj solid waste landfill zone, near Airport Colony, E. Kanpur Road, Lucknow.\nSaadatganj Mountain, as it was sometimes called. But how could it be a mountain, as Naveen himself once said, when it was the lowest place in the world?\nHe survived as a gleaner. He gathered animals\u2019 viscera for sale as surgical sutures; he wet bales of paper so they weighed more on the broker\u2019s scales; he crushed cans under the wheels of trucks; he reclaimed ink from disposable pens.\nAlso, he resumed his art, although he declined to call it that.\nThe objects he made in this time were amusements, merely, toys and trifles for the children of other gleaners. (Recently, Ganesa on Bicycle (e-waste assemblage #4) was sold at auction for thirty-five crore USR.)\nHe lived eighteen months on Saadatganj. That he survived this time is attributable, I believe, to some confusion on the mountain\u2019s behalf. Wasn\u2019t the fellow dead already? But it wasn\u2019t above toying with him even so. He was wounded once in a landslide, a second time in a fire fuelled by the gasification of rotting materials.\nHis burns became infected, and here his story might have ended were it not for the intervention of Dr. Saryu V. Tamhane.\nI met Dr. Tamhane once, for an interview. An interesting character. Her black hair was in a heavy braid, as I recall. She preferred to wear it up.\nIt rose directly above her head. Woven with fibres of kevlar and boron nitride, it extended forty-three thousand kilometers into the sky \u2014 above the sky \u2014 into high orbit, to the Chandrayaan IndusObserver geosynchronous communications satellite above Andhra Pradesh.\nNot a sparrow fell in the subcontinent but that Dr. Tamhane marked its passing.\nHer funding stemmed from various private and public auspices that reposed their faith on the \u2018soft economy\u2019, so-called; the idea that India\u2019s most precious resource was India.\nShe had discovered Mritak\u2019s earlier, village works. She had searched him out, found him on the mountainside, plucked him to safety \u2014 these matters are related elsewhere.\nShe saw to his medical care. She oversaw his career.\nSuccess succeeded success. Even Dr. Tamhane was dizzied by the prices that attached to his work. But then, as Mritak himself observed, art often commands high prices after its maker\u2019s death.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAround me, the field-governors crackle and smack with wet electricity. They maintain the sculptures\u2019 forms, and pull at me, the suit working against their energies.\nWe have all seen those fools who feel the need to touch art. I have seen them, rich, influential men and women, so-called collectors, running their hands over their sculptures, as if the dull, haptic sense might enrich their understanding. But they have no understanding. What they do not grasp is that the art is not there; that it cannot be touched. Sometimes it is barely there to be seen. The art \u2014 it is an abstraction, like prana, the Hindu life-essence; an idea, almost entirely divorced from the physical. The greatest art is all but invisible; the work itself, the sculpture, is little more than a place-marker.\nI move more lightly, appreciating the works around me.\nThe genius: to unite gravity with art. Forces, tensions. A balance so exquisite. I think of the sadhus and sadhvis who deny the worldly to achieve the spiritual, the body waning like the glass under a lens-grinder\u2019s tools. The less that is visible, the greater is the light.\nThis is art without visible flaw. This is earnest, this is playful. I sense references to Henry Moore\u2019s \u2018Reclining Figure\u2019 \u2014 or at least the holes in that sculpture. I perceive the utilitarian beauty that is the goal of the structural engineer, who strives for lightness \u2026 but such an engineer must despair, here, before these structures, reduced to less than their basics \u2026 only the idea remaining \u2026 even the idea barely here \u2026 items to be apprehended by the imagination, or not at all\u2026\nI find myself thinking of bridges, I know not why, when I totter into an L-shaped alcove. And there is a bridge here. Bold, extraordinary, arching from nothing to nothing.\nIt is not long before I sense someone standing at the other end of it.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI will not lie: I was tempted. It was this very temptation that decided me against accepting the invitation.\nI sent a reply reminding the collector of their moral duty to return the work to the Allahabad Museum, from which it had been stolen. Further, I notified the authorities, who proved unable to trace the source of the invitation. Perhaps it had been a hoax after all.\nI forgot about the matter until the collector was discovered a year later. Harsh Vaddan-Nadda, a former minister of cultural affairs. He was found dead. Suicide. He had impaled himself on the sculpture.\n\u2018Mosquito\u2019 was returned to the museum. The curators offered Naveen a chance to repair it. His instructions were only that it be cleaned, and no longer listed as unfinished.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMoving forward, my boots come up against a step at this end of the bridge. I try to mount it, without success. I try again, but my armored knees lock, and I slip, almost fall.\nIt is less by the crude sensors of my helmet than my critical acuity that I understand that the figure is gesturing to me.\nAgain I try to mount the steps, again I fail. Ach! This suit!\nI scrabble at the suit\u2019s chest, and a panel gives way. Some mechanism behind it falters. I feel a gentle disequilibrium. I widen the opening, experiencing shearing forces.\nI get a better grip, pull; something cracks, and for a moment I think it is one of my ribs, then look down and see fragments of the panel in my hand.\nThe disrobing is easier after that, section after section, each panel and component a step closer to \u2014\nFrom behind me: Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar \u2014 the plugdoor \u2014 I turn, see someone entering, huge and anonymous in their own unwieldy suit. I shout and back away. The intruder is nimble, catching my shoulders with armoured hands. The struggle is brief. I am dragged from the studio, my tears lifted into helices by competing gravities.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI cannot look at the man who saved me \u2014 his name is Yusri Nabil. It is not shame that makes me turn away.\nThere are medical checks. Elevated blood pressure, bruising, but nothing so terrible as that which befell G. W. Pon Rijiju. I envy him, that he was able to fully remove his suit.\nLater, there is a debrief. One of the caretakers tells me they had suspected the exhibition was designed as a trap; now they are sure. They are apologetic, but I do not care. Naveen died there, they believe, crushed to nothing by tidal forces, but not before setting the bait. The figure at the end of the bridge. Grandfather Bunny, it must be he, invisibly beckoning, wanting to do to me what he had done to his grandson\u2026\nAll I wish is to return to him, this ultimate expression of the artistic urge\u2026\nAfter another examination, I am declared fit for travel.\nWith time, I reboard the tigership. With chuffs and breathy growls, we bound from the lunar surface.\nThe Earth comes into view.\nI almost weep to see it. This pathetic thing! This visible thing! Trying so hard to be beautiful! Bleak as a child\u2019s abandoned toy!\nThe time for toys is over! Do you not understand this? This is the lesson that Naveen is teaching. Visible matter has been our plaything too long.\nI look away. The tigership shivers and roars. She gurrs, yaps, huffs. The hull shakes with more attitude adjustments than seem strictly necessary.\nIt is as if the tigress were trying to draw my attention to something.\nAgain, I look outside \u2014 and find I am not looking at the Earth, but the vacuum beyond it.\nWhere I see \u2026 or don\u2019t see\u2026\nWith my imagination, with my artistic sense attuned, I feel sure, by my recent experiences, I perceive \u2014\nA structure far larger than Earth. In which our planet serves as a little bit of drab to accentuate the loveliness, the invisible rococo \u2014 which recalls the architectures of certain temples, with floral elements \u2014 alive, are they? \u2014 and unseen leaves gentling in the vacuum breeze, and darkmatter vines greater in size than can be seen; but then, none of this can be seen\u2026\nHere it is, and here, and everywhere \u2014 darkmatter art curling away in all directions, into the deeps of space, into the sun, whose brilliance does nothing to make a sculpture less visible that is invisible anyway; and I experience a sensation that I attribute at first to one of the ship\u2019s course corrections, but is in fact a lifting of the heart.\nHere is a work that preceded Naveen Mritak by millennia. A masterpiece more ancient than humanity, from an artist of another race.\nAlmost, art had been my destruction. But as ever, the fault was mine; I had simply been looking at it the wrong way. Art is that which isn\u2019t seen, and this is to the good, because the unseen makes up so very much of the world.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue27\/3lbe27_story4.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"Never have I travelled so far to review an exhibition.

I gathered more than enough from the vacuum\u2019s waste bin after collecting the dust that had gathered upon every surface in the lab vacated by Mother last year when, after a particularly severe pique of ennui, she decided her private experiments, conducted at home since my infancy, were sufficiently advanced enough for her to at last found her dream biofab company on a different coast; and the dust caked on the vast collection of books in Father\u2019s study, abandoned alongside HUD, the underdeveloped AI he\u2019d been developing and publishing incomprehensible papers on for years, after he followed Mother, as he always would; and the dust from my own neglected rooms, collected in a year\u2019s worth of unwashed cups, moldering takeout containers bought with the ample funds in the Trust my parents established for when I had reached my age of majority shortly before they\u2019d left; and the dust upon the heaps of unwashed clothing. It pleased me to no end to have found a proper use for this waste, which had admittedly accumulated to an embarrassing degree. I ran my clean fingers along the now pristine apparatus shelves in Mother\u2019s lab as I let the biomass parser separate the organic from the inorganic.\nSquames, HUD informed me, made up an adequate portion of the collected material. Packed full of protective keratin and coated in a layer of water-proof lipids, they had begun their lives perfectly alive before being alienated from their home in the basal layer of an epidermis. As they were starved of vital oxygen, they became something quite unrecognizable to the stem cells that begat them, squashed thin and discarded, unnoticed. Despite their increasingly unfeeling nature, they still had a purpose: to protect the fragile tissue within. I felt a satisfaction in restoring to a kind of half-life these faithful cells, that they might know purpose once again.\nI directed the organic components into the duplicator, then into the largest of Mother\u2019s molding-field chambers, just as I had observed Mother to have done countless times. I was periodically checking the organic lines, as she had, and keeping a keen eye that the control nanites were sufficiently incorporated, when I felt something tickle my foot. Looking down, it was an ant! In my hermetically sealed haven! I squashed it violently with my other foot, then fell to my knees, eyes scanning the cold white tile for movement. A cheerful ding interrupted my vigilance to announce the completion of the molding. Muttering, I stood, warily scanning the floor as I opened the chamber.\nI am not sure what I had been expecting to find laying upon the chamber\u2019s slab, truth be told. Something that looked like me, at least, based on the input values I had inferred from principles gleaned from Mother\u2019s notes. It was gray. As gray as the dust it had been born from, and oddly transparent, like a fingernail molded to have my shape, with translucent fingernail-gray eyes staring out beneath unblinking lids. I ran a quick diagnostic on the simplified version of HUD I had installed in its nanites, then commanded it to stand, which I was relieved it did promptly. It was precisely my height and build, and perhaps dressed in a long coat and scarf, it might go unremarked on its trip to the store. However, as I described to my creation how to walk there, I realized the store had closed hours before, so I ushered it back into the chamber for the night.\nI returned to my lab in the morning, and when I raised the chamber lid, the most horrid smell issued forth. I sealed the chamber and began the compound recycling program, cursing my stupidity.\nOf course, squames weren\u2019t the only organic contents of dust. HUD had neglected to mention the also uncountable masses of bacteria, fungi, and mites that happily made an overnight meal of my creation. I stared at the chamber for a long while, disgusted with myself, then placed a delivery order for some industrial grade disinfectants and ant traps, but not toilet paper.\nIt was now the principle of the thing.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe patch of my arm beneath the sterile bandage still faintly stung where HUD had taken the epidermal sample. As the cultures auto-propagated, I constructed a polymer shell over a light metal frame onto which a complete nanite-infused epidermis would be grafted. An epidermis, HUD had informed me this morning during what it had called, \u201ccoffee and quality time,\u201d consisted of more than just keratinocytes. There were also melanocytes, which protected keratinocytes from the sun; mechanoreceptor cells that sensed the environment; and immune cells to provide the defensive response necessary to repel microbial interlopers. I was grateful to HUD for deconvoluting Father\u2019s notes so that I could now augment its knowledge stores. An updated, and very grateful, HUD had even supplied me with information on how to speed up the mitotic divisions to enable more rapid growth. As the morning stretched into afternoon, I became so convinced of my success that I was feeling quite pleased with myself, and when the chamber dinged, I eagerly opened its lid to behold my new creation.\nMy new completely bald creation.\nAfter a long moment, HUD informed me that if I had wanted it to have hair, I should have also given it a dermis, at which point I told it to shut up.\nSighing, I bade my creation stand, then investigated its epidermis by running a hand over its upper arm. The skin was a disconcerting room temperature and perfectly smooth, with an unfortunate grayish tinge from the polymer beneath. I scratched gently with my fingernail, which tore the layer, revealed to be no thicker than a sheet of paper.\nStill, when faced with the diminishing stack of take-out napkins, it would have to do.\nI dressed it in a freshly laundered shirt and jeans, taped sunglasses to its earless head to cover its matte grey eyes, then pulled a beanie over its naked scalp. It didn\u2019t look too odd, so long as you didn\u2019t look too closely. After that, I told it how to get to the store, where to find the toilet paper, then shoved money in its hand and cycled the front door airlock Mother had installed when I had been a tween, along with the HEPA-filtered ventilation system to prevent contamination of her precious experiments. As the airlock hissed, I closed my eyes and pressed my hands to my ears so that I would not have to watch my creation as it left me.\nThen I waited, busily. In the lab, I alphabetized the notebooks from which I had learned Mother\u2019s craft. In the study, I had HUD ingest books on adaptive database construction and creative thinking, so it might better anticipate my scientific needs.\nWhat returned from the store was not what had left.\nLimp peeling ribbons of skin hung from its arms and face, revealing patches of grey beneath. What skin remained intact was covered in red splotches and sores that would have wept if it\u2019d had a lymphatic system, my HUD delightedly informed me. The beanie and glasses were gone, and part of its head had been caved in. What had happened to it?\nWorse yet, it had come back empty handed.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHUD eagerly informed me that the dermis gave skin its elasticity, contained hair follicles and nerves through which the mechanosensory cells transmitted heat and touch information, and blood vessels to keep the skin fed, which I reminded HUD it could have mentioned sooner. As HUD prattled on about sweat and sebum glands, I scratched at the fresh bandage on my chin and suppressed a yawn, having missed Coffee and Quality Time that morning to better ration the remaining napkins. An annoyed HUD had become quite inappropriately gleeful, as it gathered the requisite samples from different parts of my body, and by the time it had finished, I had nearly convinced myself I enjoyed the sharp kiss of antiseptic.\nMeanwhile, I busied myself with improvements to the frame. Into its chest, I built a bellows and pump to circulate the oxygenated fluids (dyed a healthy pink) around a new outer layer, which was covered by a membrane to which the blood vessels could attach. For energy, I added a diffusor compartment into its belly and ran a pipe to the mouth opening in the frame\u2019s head for nutrient solution intake, and a wash compartment in the rear into which non-recyclable metabolites could be gathered. Finally, I programmed and installed a haptic feedback computer into its head and ran fine cables throughout the frame onto which the mechanosensory cells would attach, which would allow my creature to sense and react to its surroundings.\nI passed the time waiting for the molding chamber to finish by feeding HUD chapters from books I found in the study on morality, etiquette, and emotional intelligence, when I noticed something moving on the floor on the far side of the lab.\nAnts! A parade of them began somewhere near the lab bench, and their procession led straight into my organic storage tanks! I retrieved the cleaning spray and towel and committed a joyless genocide, after which I cleaned out the ductwork of my tanks, finding a small leak, which I closed with sealing foam. I followed the remaining frantic ants back to a small hole where the bench met the wall, then sealed that as well. I threw the soiled towel into the recycler, washed my hands so thoroughly the skin on my knuckles bled, then sat on the floor, slowly breathing in the musty smell of sodium hypochlorite, determinedly not thinking about the writhing invaders in the walls.\nRelief came with a ding, and what I found inside brought tears to my eyes that had little to do with the bleach fumes.\nIts skin was fresh and pink-looking, covered in hair ranging from fine to coarse in all the places a body should have hair, including a short mop on its scalp identical to my own that came down around the ears, I had molded myself by hand. I pressed my own ear to its cool chest to hear the steady hum of its bellows-pump whirring. I grabbed a bottle and poured essential micro- and macronutrient soup into its mouth, then gently pressed a fingernail into the skin of its upper arm. It stretched, then sprung back, the fluid layer beneath it giving gently. The skin was still relatively thin, but its elasticity delighted me. Even the fingers and toes had fingerprints, albeit different ones from my own.\nI ruffled its hair once with joy then handed over a fresh pair of pants, a button-down shirt, and a pair of sunglasses to hide the two cameras I had fixed into its eye-sockets.\nI ushered it out through the airlock, money in hand, this time peeking between my fingers enough to see through the inner airlock\u2019s portal the brilliant sunshine that poured from a cloudless sky onto a tangle of gray and green before the door slammed shut and the airlock cycled. If it didn\u2019t come back with toilet paper this time, I swore to myself, I would eat my lab coat.\nWhile I waited, I scoured the baseboards of my rooms, the lab, the study, spray bottle at the ready, surveilling for more crawling insects, but found none, so I sat down with a cup of bitter, reheated coffee in the study, which I had to admit, had become a more welcoming place now that the dust had been cleared away, and waited.\nThe sound of the airlock got me to my feet, and with an increasingly overwhelming sense of coffee-inspired urgency, I rushed to the airlock to greet my creature, who stood, soaking wet, in the foyer, its skin covered in leaking sores.\nIn its hands it carried a single roll of soggy pink toilet paper.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nYet, I needed to know where I had gone wrong. After all, a true Scientist must also always make decisions based on all available facts. HUD unhelpfully pointed out that, so far, I had not been using such an approach, and thanks to my recent attentions to its programming, it could make some suggestions about where I could improve myself, but I told it, in no uncertain terms, exactly where it could shove its self-improvement.\nHUD peevishly fed the recording of my creature\u2019s trip into an ocular headset, and I sat at the lab bench and watched, helpless, as my creature walked with a steady determined pace into a sky so blue and a world so green that I had not remembered could be so beautiful. The courtyard had long overgrown with a choking tangle of weeds, grass, overgrown bushes, and climbing vines that covered the sweating stone walls. The iron gate had rusted and shed desiccated black paint flecks at my creature\u2019s touch, revealing a rich reddish orange beneath. All were colors with no place inside this home, and I experienced an ache I had not known in some time. Though my creation lacked the proper sensory equipment, I swear I could smell all that green around me.\nBeyond was a shady tree-lined street of tidy-looking brownstones, busy with traffic, foot and otherwise, all partaking in the commerce of living, which my creature navigated with a confidence I envied as it passed people who barely acknowledged it. The day was beautiful and clear, and so I leaned back in Father\u2019s chair and watched the clouds in the sky for some time, until I realized we had arrived at the grocers. As my creature entered, I tensed, but the greeter gave it no more than a faltering smile. Nor did the young man it pushed past utter more than a single loud complaint. Then, once again, it elicited only a vocal protest when it knocked over the shopping cart of an elderly woman lost in thought at the paper towels. When my creature reached the toilet paper, it grabbed one single roll, and I made a mental note to give it more explicit instructions next time to get a jumbo pack instead.\nBy the time my creature reached the check-out aisle, people were recoiling, pointing, pulling away. The reason became clear as my creature passed to the front of a check-out lane and held out the money in a suppurating hand. The clerk hastily indicated to leave it on the counter, which it did. It returned home with the same purposeful stride.\nI switched off the feed and stared at my deflated and dripping creature. No one had been responsible for the injury to my creature. There was only one explanation: the corruption must have come from within the lab.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI wailed, I beat my fists on the cold tiles, I scattered Mother\u2019s notebooks to the floor, de-shelved every book in Father\u2019s study. How could something that had come from myself become so deranged?\nHUD assured me I was thinking about things all wrong. It wasn\u2019t derangement. It was naivet\u00e9. It told me that even though we cannot see them, microbial communities are an integral part of us, and that we give them food and shelter in exchange for their protection against pathogens, and at that point I had told it to shut up, but it was already well beyond the point of heeding me if it didn\u2019t want to. It explained that I, like the skin on my creature, made for a poor home environment, indeed, and that we both needed to grow up and stop terrorizing the poor people at the grocers.\nI hated that HUD was right, but it was, of course, right. This meant I needed to create an environment in which my creature and my microbial biome could coexist in the same non-pathogenic way that it existed on me. For that, it would need oil and sweat to feed them, and warmth to nurture them.\nAfter once again recycling the organic material from my creature and tossing all my hyper-stringent cleaning products into my molecular recyclers, I set about the work of adding a module to the frame\u2019s nerve processor to maintain a constant body heat through the use of sweat. HUD soberly extracted tissue from my adrenal and reproductive organs to supply the hormones necessary for sebum production. For improved padding and insulation in the skin layer, and to help prevent leakage, I had HUD take samples of my fatty, hypodermal tissue. The final touch was a pair of glossy, realistic lenses for the cameras that resembled my own eyes.\nWaiting for my creature\u2019s completion, I absently rubbed at a wound on my abdomen, feeling a deep ache I knew had nothing to do with the biopsy. An occasional ant would emerge from the hole in the wall to explore the scattered papers on the tile floor. I envied its fearless, steady paces.\nAt the ding, I lifted the lid of the chamber, startled to see my creature\u2019s eyes looking into my own. After having it stand, I fed it soup then stood back to regard it. This version looked more youthful, thanks to the fat layer beneath its skin. I ran a finger along its upper arm and saw the fine hairs horripilate.\nI removed my lab coat, my shirt, my pants, my underwear, and I wrapped its arms around me and my arms around it.\nWe stayed like that for a long time.\nTo transfer my skin microbiome, of course.\nAny motivations beyond that wouldn\u2019t be scientific.\nWhen I let go, small pustules began to erupt on its glistening face. I touched a finger to its forehead. It came away oily. A ripe smell emanated from its armpits. When I pressed a hand to its chest, I could feel its pump fluttering at an elevated rate.\nI pressed a hand to my own chest and was surprised to find a similar cadence there. Its eyes turned to meet mine once more as a bead of sweat worked down from its hairline to its cheekbone, to its chin.\nI hesitated, then took one of its hands in my own, feeling strangely lightheaded as I did so, horripilation raising on my own arms.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I found myself saying. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nOne morning as we practiced our daily Coffee and Quality Time, HUD, finally recovered from a most profound pout, did remind me that my creature had still not successfully purchased any useable toilet paper from the store. I reminded it of the bidet we\u2019d installed, which had quickly minimized the need for any toilet paper, but it firmly pressed the point that without successfully acquiring toilet paper by physically going to the store, this entire experiment was a failure.\nI acknowledged that HUD had a point.\nIt was a beautiful day out, clear and calm, and the people on the streets seemed to be in an especially cheerful mood as they smiled and nodded; as was the greeter at the grocers, and even the check-out clerk as they scanned the single roll of double-ply toilet paper. On the walk home, I enjoyed how the soft breeze carried with it the strong green smell of grass.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue34\/3lbe34_story5.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"The idea came to me late one afternoon as I pondered the naked cardboard at the heart of my last roll of toilet paper.

Almost as if he was an old, taped analog run. Still, nagging up the network was this feeling of approach, a pending dis-ease. She could feel it urgently, calling and repelling at the same time, down through the wire and silicon ganglia, through portals and down corridors. And just barely, if she was very quiet and shut off nearly all synaptic activity, she thought she could hear a disturbing singing:\nCross held up don' scare me none, baby\nAin\u2019t 'fraid a my reflection no mo'\nNecklace a garlic just stink, that\u2019s all\nAn\u2019 I'm right on t'other side a yo do\u2019\nWhat the hell was it? Fear leached into her like nasty rainwater acid and made her asshole pucker. She was just a little Excel file anchored here down nine levels of subdirectory. It had only been a few input sessions since the Creator had moved her off the hard drive and out into the network environment. And then, unbidden, this realization came to her: since the move across a universe of wafers and chips, It had executed no backup.\nOh fuck, she thought. So this is how it ends.\nLater, off in the distance, up the path, she could hear the gasps and shrieks of other files \u2014 it sounded like an entire batch colony! Also, maybe, little sharp aspirations of pleasure \u2014 sharp intakes of carefully measured breath and the slick, oiled sounds of repro.\nOh, Creator! she thought. Please move me back, please move me back to the C:drive again. If only the Creator would reach out and gather her in Its arms, and carry her away from these mean neural streets. This was a rough fucking neighborhood, and she'd known it from the moment the Creator had saved her down a new directory path.\nThen she heard that hideous singing again:\nDon' wilt inna sun like lettuce, sugar\nHear me tap on yo windowpane\nPump it up real nice n sweet now mama\nGotta jones for yo lovely vein\nAs this refrain unfolded, the voice carrying this awful tune grew in magnitude until it seemed just up her own corridor. VICHYSSOISE.PPT craned his speculum neck to see the approach, and ERESWHT heard a shuffling sound of huge feet, the clacking of claws on the floorboards. The cries and moans of batch files grew closer, and she saw VICHYSSOISE\u2019s eyes evolve and bloat as he confronted, in his mineral mind, the beast that emerged from the shadow of the corridor\u2019s orifice and assembled before him.\nThe virus was horrific \u2014 more so than ERESWHT would have imagined in her most profound nightmares. The beast was not silica-based but oozed carbon or, rather, a mutated, bastardized form of carbon. It was a weak, pale sort of cyan, and the character symbols L, O, C, U, S and T flashed through her attributes folder as she steeped recall from an Encarta file that had once passed through her subdirectory, back in the hard drive days. An insect, she thought, and hopping mad.\nIts six legs stood still for a moment to allow ERESWHT to get a good look at it. The mandible moved across itself in a frenetic buzz, the movement of teeth weirdly kinetic. ERESWHT thought, from the same Encarta disc: B-A-N-D-S-A-W. The movement stopped, and she could see gore and its drainage across the jaw, down the exoneck, splashed across the abdomen like a signature of doom. Corrupted data dripped to the floor from its flanks, gathering on its hairs then falling, slowly, slowly, slowly. Its plashing was like an invitation, and she felt herself giving in, being seduced. Suddenly she wanted the beast to come nearer.\nThe virus feasted on VICHYSSOISE.PPT, first wrapping its forelegs around ERESWHT\u2019s subdirectorymate, then affixing its mandible around the Powerpoint file\u2019s neck. ERESWHT could only watch in a mixture of horror, revulsion and desire as the bug unsheathed its fangs. And as the black needle tips of them punctured her companion\u2019s pale neck and drew life from the old file, the beast turned so she had a full, unmitigated view of the abomination. Unable to move, anchored, chained in place by her Creator, ERESWHT observed in agonized fascination as the locust-thing sucked data from VICHYSSOISE. A small tear in the shape of an asterisk slid down her crystalline cheek, and she felt a stab of it again: desire.\nThen, from the anterior lobe of the beast, from where ERESWHT had assumed its anus drooped, came a rush of what she first thought were eggs \u2014 small round elongated objects of a pale hue. But they started to squirm and move in the pile that had gushed from the virus, assembling themselves in a phalanx that moved toward VICHYSSOISE\u2019s now-still form. As the beast continued to embrace the empty Powerpoint file, the maggots moved onto her old friend, moving up him in a larval brood, leaving trails of excretion and emptiness. The larva worked the file over and as the beast released it and it dropped to the floor, the babies stripped the husk and pulsed and grew larger.\nThe virus turned and opened its maw in ERESWHT\u2019s direction. There in its hole, she could see spurious data from her friend mixed with the guts and meat and sinew of other files. The eyes of the locust-thing fell on her, gazed directly at ERESWHT, and the beast ejaculated a cruel laugh. It gestured at her chains, as if to ask it what could be done \u2014 what alternative was there to a peaceful giving over of herself to it?\nThen the horrific fucker began, again, to sing:\nStake in the heart won\u2019t make it, honey\nDon\u2019 sleep in a big pine crate\nCause I\u2019m mad bad Vlad, dad\nAn\u2019 it\u2019s yo blood and guts I'm onna eat!\nHer heart sank like a dropping bag of offal. The beast approached her, and as it came near ERESWHT sensed its odor, a sweet, gag-inducing septic cover. Corruption and rot flew from its pores in great, retching waves, and the cilia upon it twitched and undulated. Underneath, at the base of its abdomen, she observed \u2014 as if observing an occurrence happening to another file across a cosmos, and not something happening, or about to happen, to herself \u2014 the virus\u2019s reproductive organ unfold and grow rigid like a great girder. As the beast\u2019s mouth opened close to her and hot breath played out across her face, and as the points of its fangs again slipped from their sheaths, ERESWHT\u2019s fear\/desire became complete and she voided herself and urged, Yes.\nThe creature closed, reached out with its plated forelegs to grip her steady. Its viral talons sliced into the sweet crystal flesh of her flanks, and entering with this invasion, an entirely new hive of delicious pain cut into her. Needling filaments of carmine depixelization exploded in her vision, and the baby bugs moved off VICHYSSOISE and headed her way. She had a brief, stark impression \u2014 H-O-R-N-E-T \u2014 and cried out softly in response to its sting. The knives of the beast\u2019s fingers carved rough, ragged wounds in her sides. From them flowed a fat ichor of ones and zeros, and she looked down to watch the flux of her own sweet digital nectar. It coursed from her, and she saw it splash off her own abdomen and the beast\u2019s midriff, joined. It spread in a pool on the floor under them, and ERESWHT.XLS remembered in a brief flash her resolution, the moment when the Creator pointed and clicked her into being.\nShe felt its fetid teeth puncture the thin glass of her neck, the skin fracturing into a web pattern, then bursting inward, shards falling through the core of her. She reached to grip him, to pull him to her and urge him onward. She wrapped herself onto him and froze there like ice, surrendered the bytes of herself into his swelling, swallowing gullet. Then, barely aspirated through the stabbing and gnashing and invasion and thrusts of the locust-beast, the vladic bug, the impaler, she flung a notion Heavenward in her last throes \u2014 this thought: Oh Father of Silicon, Author and Perfecter of this poor sinner, You who know me datum by datum, have mercy on\u2026\n\u2022\n\u00a9 2001 Brian Ames, all rights reserved","source":null,"source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/hK6Sxt3Se20kooQVEmYYkMEcB8E.json"}

Though he was spiteful and never did put her name into it anywhere. And yes, that was spite, pure spite, because she\u2019d told him how much she hated those songs where the women were just things and didn\u2019t even get names other than honey and sweetheart and darling.\nThe ghost moves restlessly. Its mouth gapes. There is a shimmer of ice-sharp teeth, a smile cut out of stars, a waiting throat like a dark void.\nHe wrote the second verse in the hospital, after his vasectomy. By then he\u2019d married her, this woman, and he didn\u2019t want her to birth anything but his music. Because every time he looked at her, it seemed like a song got beamed straight out of her and into his head. That was why he had told her to stop working, after the songs started making a lot of money. He said the money was both of theirs, that she inspired the songs. But she didn\u2019t smile at that, just said, you say the money\u2019s mine, but the songs sure aren\u2019t.\nThose words led into that refrain again. Once again he withheld her name because women come and go. Putting her name in the song would have been like having it tattooed on him, something he\u2019d either have to live with or pay a lot of money to have expunged. And even if he got rid of it later, it\u2019d always be there, lurking at the edges. Like the ghost is now.\nHe doesn\u2019t look at it, the ghost. He thinks that if it knows he can perceive it, it may not hold still any longer.\nThe refrain dies away. This is the third verse, the verse after they\u2019d had a fight and she\u2019d walked out the door. He could have gone after her, could have been a clich\u00e9 and yanked her back, bruised her, become that clich\u00e9 country-western batterer. At least he knew better than that.\nMaybe he\u2019d been a little afraid she\u2019d hurt him back, he might have admitted if he\u2019d been honest. Sometimes you look for pain when you\u2019re angry, because you feel like the two forces will extinguish each other, flame and water, matter and anti-matter. Or maybe it was just that by then he knew words were the way to hurt her most.\nThe end of the song is coming. The ghost is waiting, blue with cold. Blue with loneliness. Blue as the shine of an empty promise. Blue as eternal love.\nOh that refrain. He wishes now it was nothing but her name, over and over and over again. It is not, but her name is there somehow, pushing up against the words that refuse it. Why, when we are hurting, is our first impulse to give that pain away? No matter how much we hand off, it stays with us.\nIn the fourth verse, he\u2019d known he was telling things that were not his to tell. He couldn\u2019t pretend that he hadn\u2019t known. He couldn\u2019t pretend that a part of him hadn\u2019t thought today\u2019s phone call would come. That she\u2019d give way under the blows that someone else might think slight, but that had been aimed precisely, delicately, to splinter her soul. Shatter her. What had he thought would happen?\nThe refrain will be repeated twice after this verse. And then the song will die away. He dreads it; he welcomes it. At least then this tension will be over.\nWhy did he deny her that name? She\u2019d called him by his, never a nickname, never some epithet. His name, spoken in love, spoken in anger. His name, which she would not speak again. Did she say it while she was dying, slipping away by her own hand? And hadn\u2019t it been his hand, directing it from afar?\nThe refrain starts a second time. Oh her name her name.\nAnd then the last note of the song dies away and then the ghost speaks as it slices him to pieces, sharper than knives, more intense than any laser, and all of him is undone and all that\u2019s left is a ghost, whispering her own name into the silence, calling herself home. Calling herself home.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue31\/3lbe31_story6.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"At the end of the song, a ghost is waiting.

The precipitation is accompanied by an unseasonal damp chill that lodges itself in Jana\u2019s bones. She shivers, even under the double protection of sweater and raincoat. She\u2019s not sure their luggage is rainproof enough to withstand such intense precipitation. She clutches Dean\u2019s arm, rubs her cheek on his shoulder. The smell of him chases away some of her agitation \u2014 having imbibed vermilion nonstop for five days her sense of smell is now animalistic \u2014 but she\u2019s still disappointed: she had looked forward to witnessing firsthand the celebrated sea view of the Venera cityscape. How often will she get to sail into what is reputed to be the most strangely beautiful metropolis on Earth? The weather is bound to clear up, though, and then maybe they can book a boat tour around the archipelago and get a good eyeful of the cityscape as seen from the sea.\nAt the exit of the boat, someone is waiting for them. A sturdy man with a crew cut dressed in a formal uniform that sits uncomfortably on his rough frame holds a sign with Dean\u2019s name. Next to the man is an enclosed two-wheel cart; after vigorously shaking Dean\u2019s hand and kissing Jana\u2019s, the latter in a manner that manages to be both brash and polite, he introduces himself \u2014 Carlo \u2014 and tucks away their luggage safely in his impermeable conveyance.\nHe motions for them to follow him, and they venture into the rain-darkened metropolis. Jana can barely see more than two arms\u2019 length anywhere around her. She holds on tightly to Dean as they zigzag into the unknown. To Jana\u2019s surprise, Dean is sure-footed, easily keeping pace with Carlo, who, even laden with the cart, navigates the narrow claustrophobic streets with a dancer\u2019s grace, belying her first impression of the bulky hotel employee. Then Dean surprises her even further when he starts to shout to Carlo through the percussive din of the rain, and the two men engage in a boisterous exchange punctuated with roars and laughter.\nBesides her native English, Jana can barely squeak by in Spanish and French; to her Toronto ears Dean and Carlo are speaking something close to Italian, but tinged with Arabic, French, and Spanish. It must be Veneran, a language few people learn outside the archipelago itself. Jana and Dean have been together for nearly two years now \u2014 their second anniversary will occur here in Venera, and Jana suspects that the entire trip, paid for by Dean, is an elaborate setup for a marriage proposal \u2014 but she still doesn\u2019t really know much about his past, and now that he\u2019s displaying familiarity with mysterious, glamorous Venera she\u2019s more curious than ever \u2014 and more drawn to him.\nWithout Jana having noticed that they ever passed through a doorway or any kind of threshold, the three of them are now standing at the desk of the World Tree Hotel, its green and rust-red logo \u2014 depicting Yggdrasil, the World Tree of Norse myth \u2014 embossed on the front panel so realistically that it is as if the tree\u2019s roots reach into the soil underneath the hotel\u2019s marble floor.\nJana is drenched to the bone, shivering in spite of the heat. The heavy, confining layers of raincoat and sweater suffocate her. She removes them, hungry for air. Even her shirt and bra are uncomfortably damp, but she feels a moment of relief. Suddenly it\u2019s all too much: the incomprehensible Veneran language, the confusing organic architecture, the oppressive clamminess of the air, the pungent odors, the lobby filled only with men. Their palpable masculinity assails her senses, as if some primordial pheromone receptor had just been kickstarted \u2014 perhaps another side-effect of vermilion? Dean had warned her not to overdo it with the cocktails. She had never tasted the notorious Veneran psychotropic spice before. Without realizing she\u2019s doing it aloud, she moans, and all those male eyes turn toward her, intensifying her sense of being trapped, surrounded, surveilled. She shivers violently, a penetrating cold icing through her veins.\nDean cries, \u201cJana\u2026\u201d He steps toward her, but as he moves he is transformed into a grotesque caricature of himself, half-tree, half-wolfman. The entire lobby and all in it are also transmogrified into something otherworldly, so otherworldly that she cannot distinguish what is alive from what is not.\nShe closes her eyes. Hands grab at her. At first, they feel like rough bark scraping against the skin of her arms. But she hears Dean\u2019s voice, repeating her name gently. Then she recognizes the grip. Dean\u2019s hands. Not soft like a woman\u2019s, but softer than bark. Firm masculine hands. She opens her eyes, and there he is, holding her. The lobby is back as it was. But she is still cold and shivering. And weakened.\nDean supports her as Carlo leads them to their room. Jana keeps her eyes closed the whole way, surrendering herself to her man.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDean finds her trembling on all fours. He dampens a clean towel, cleans her up, and brings her back to bed. He slips under the covers and presses her against his chest; she lets herself breathe him in. She shivers a few times, but she eventually starts to feel warm and drowsy \u2026\n\u2026 The sound of Dean\u2019s voice brings Jana back to consciousness. He\u2019s on the phone, talking in Veneran. She still hasn\u2019t asked him about that.\nHe hangs up, and she asks, yawning, \u201cWho was that?\u201d\n\u201cI called the front desk. They\u2019re sending a maid over to clean the bathroom.\u201d\nThat jars her out of her torpor. \u201cWhat? No! Don\u2019t embarrass me like that. Call back. I\u2019ll clean it.\u201d But she\u2019s thinking: You should clean it, Dean. And I shouldn\u2019t have to ask.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll do no such thing, amora. I\u2019m taking care of it. There\u2019s nothing embarrassing. We\u2019re paying for service, and we\u2019re getting it. You need fresh air, though, but you also need to keep warm. Did you bring any sweaters?\u201d\nShe nods; Dean rifles through her luggage, pulling out her clothes carelessly. Defeated, Janna feels weak again. She\u2019s hungry, but the thought of food turns her stomach.\nHe comes to bed and dresses her. She lets him, neither cooperating nor hindering. He wraps her in extra blankets pulled from the bottom drawer of the dresser. He leads her outside; it\u2019s still raining: a cascading wall of grey obscuring everything. But there\u2019s no wind, and the balcony is well protected and dry. So he sits her on a chaise longue, and she closes her eyes, exhausted.\nDespite the rain, the air is hot; the balcony is almost as sweltering as a sauna. Yesterday\u2019s unseasonable cold spell has entirely dissipated. Nevertheless, there\u2019s still a hint of chill in her bones. Jana breathes in the moistness of Venera. It smells intoxicating: flowery fragrances mixed with salty brine; sex in a woman\u2019s bedroom.\nUnder the blankets, under her clothes, she places a hand between her legs. She\u2019s wet, hungry to be touched. She slips two fingers inside herself, wishing it were Dean\u2019s fingers. She lets herself glide on that fantasy \u2026\n\u2026 Until she hears a woman yelling, from within their room.\nJana gets up and walks inside. Dean is gripping the maid\u2019s wrists together. While she struggles, the maid continues to yell at him in Veneran. There are fresh, red scratches across Dean\u2019s cheek. There\u2019s barely controlled anger in his face: he wants to hit this dark-haired woman, hurt her, whoever she is. Never in the past two years has Jana seen Dean violently angry.\nThe scene leaves Jana confused; already sexually alert, she can\u2019t help but respond to Dean\u2019s show of strength. But it scares her, too, as does her own arousal.\nThe pair notice Jana. The distraction is enough for the maid to escape Dean\u2019s hold. She hisses at the couple, but the effect is more caricatural than menacing.\nDean and Jana catch each other\u2019s eye; as if on cue, they both start to guffaw. Scowling at Dean, the maid, gesturing like a madwoman, screams something Jana can\u2019t decipher, then flings the door open and flees.\nAs abruptly as the laughter began, it ends. The weight of secrecy, strangeness, alienation, and tension that has been mounting since their arrival in Venera \u2014 momentarily dampened by that unexpected burst of complicity \u2014 bears down on Jana. Now, it is Dean himself who appears secretive, strange, alien, and the source of Jana\u2019s disquiet.\nAlmost as quickly, the mood shifts again; Dean\u2019s customary male brashness dissolves under Jana\u2019s gaze. He closes the door, then stands awkwardly, his face flickering concern, culpability, love, vulnerability. He extends a hand toward her, and she takes it. They sit on the bed. A few times in short succession, he opens his mouth as if to speak but seems unable to find the words.\nNow, Jana thinks. Now is the time to clear up all the mysteries aggregating around Dean and his relationship to Venera. All he needs is a persuasive nudge \u2026 Jana brushes his ear with her mouth and whispers, \u201cTalk to me, love.\u201d\nAnd he does. But Jana is immediately angered by the sounds he utters. He\u2019s speaking Veneran.\nShe interrupts him, shouting, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re making fun of me like this!\u201d\nInstead of laughing or escalating the heat of the argument, Dean looks bewildered, frightened.\nHe speaks again but trails off after only a few words of Veneran. Again he tries; but, still spouting Veneran, he stops abruptly. He hurries to the desk. Picking up a pen, he writes on the hotel notepad, but tears off sheet after sheet. He yells a foreign word that has the unmistakeable blunt venom of an oath. He slams his fist on the desk. Turning to Jana, he repeats pleadingly, \u201cAmora, amora, amora \u2026 \u201d \u2014 his favorite endearment, which she now gleans is not his own romantic coinage but the Veneran word for love \u2014 followed by a string of syllables she cannot understand, punctuated by a final, defeated \u201cAmora \u2026 \u201d\nThen, he grunts angrily and, shaking his fist, spits out a sentence in Veneran. With one final, tender \u201cAmora\u201d for Jana\u2019s benefit, he rushes out the door.\nJana thinks of following him, but the adrenaline rush that followed her discovery of the altercation between Dean and the maid has dissipated, and now she feels weak, her skin burning. Remembering her hallucination in the lobby, she doubts everything that she has just witnessed. Sleep. Sleep will restore her and restore reason to the world. She buries herself in the bed, but her feverish slumber is anything but peaceful. She slips in and out of consciousness, haunted by nightmares and nightmarish hallucinations, by half-human monsters and distorted memories of past humiliations and betrayals, by visions of Dean and the maid conspiring against her.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBut Jana had forgotten about the state of the bathroom. It still has not been cleaned. Best to deal with it on an empty stomach, she reasons. Being careful to set aside one clean towel for herself, she gets the job done. Part of her wants to indulge in a long shower, but she\u2019s too hungry; she makes do with a quick in and out.\nThe layout of the hotel is labyrinthine, echoing her first impression of the city as she and Dean were led to the hotel upon disembarking. The halls are cavernous \u2014 badly lit and undistinguishable one from another. Which floor is she on? Has she passed by her own room repeatedly? Jana\u2019s hunger makes her disorientation more acute. Finally, she is rescued by a solicitous young porter who finds her wandering in the halls and leads her to her destination, the restaurant. The same porter once again comes to her rescue afterward, once she has spent nearly an hour trying to find her room. Both times, in fractured English, he refuses her offer of a gratuity.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDean has yet to come back. Suspecting that the maid is her best lead to find her wayward lover Jana goes to the front desk, which, to her surprise, she finds with no difficulty.\nIt\u2019s her first time in the lobby since they arrived and she suffered that disquieting hallucination. The sight of the embossed Yggdrasil on the front desk unnerves her. She can\u2019t shake the impression that it\u2019s somehow organic, alive. That some kind of preternatural life force pulses through it, emanating outward in concentric circles of corrupting energy, decaying the fabric that coheres reality.\nJana swallows her apprehension and strides toward the desk with what she hopes is confidence. She\u2019s not certain, but she thinks she recognizes the clerk from when they arrived. A tall, bony man whose extreme thinness makes it difficult to estimate his age. The hue of his pitch-black hair, gelled in place tightly against his skull, probably comes from a bottle. \u201cExcuse me \u2014 do you speak English?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, miadama.\u201d\nJana gives him their room number. \u201cTwo days ago, we called to have the bathroom cleaned. I\u2019d like to speak to the maid, please.\u201d\n\u201cOne moment, miadama.\u201d He opens a cumbersome ledger and murmurs, \u201cSi, Natasha,\u201d then he tsks.\nJana asks, \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d\n\u201cThe maid in question has not reported for work since being sent to your room.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s her full name? Is there a way I can get in touch with her?\u201d\n\u201cMiadama, that is confidential information. We have been unable to contact her ourselves. Why did you want to talk to her? Is there any information you could give us as to her whereabouts or what happened to her?\u201d\nThe clerk\u2019s tone is now accusatory. She hesitates, not knowing how to respond. The prospect of revealing that Dean has fled with no explanation, leaving her alone, is too humiliating. Under the clerk\u2019s probing gaze, she can feel guilt spell itself on her face, although she is guilty of nothing. Another man emerges from the back offices. He is portly, disheveled, exuding stern paternalistic authority. The two Venerans confer in hushed tones \u2014 not that Jana could understand what they say, anyway. But she does catch the name \u201cNatasha\u201d a few times. Interrupting the men, she mumbles incoherently, \u201cNo \u2026 I mean \u2026 How could I \u2026 I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d They turn to look at her, staring at her, judging her silently. Finally, she blurts, \u201cIf you hear from this Natasha, please let me know. I need to speak to her. It\u2019s a private matter,\u201d and turns on her heels before either man can say anything else to her.\nBut the geometry of the hotel once again confounds her. Instead of locating the stairs that would lead her back to her room, Jana finds herself at the threshold of the exit, the relentless rain, falling a few centimeters in front of her, splatters from the ground to her bare calves. As Jana ponders whether to go forth in the heavy downpour and explore Venera with no raincoat or umbrella \u2014 she can\u2019t spend the entirety of her time here, in the world\u2019s most exotic city, holed up in a room waiting for her boyfriend \u2014 a familiar voice addresses her, \u201cMiadama?\u201d It is Carlo, the porter who greeted them at the boat, now brandishing an umbrella. \u201cMiadama, the weather has not been kind since your arrival.\u201d\nAlthough she barely knows this man at all, Jana experiences a flood of comfort at his proximity. For an instant, she feels safe; yet, she knows her face betrays her distress. She quickly recovers, but in the silence Carlo has been studying her. She softens and nestles into the male possessiveness of his gaze, finding refuge in its brash, unspoken promise of protection.\nHe asks, \u201cHave you yet seen anything of Venera?\u201d\nShe shakes her head.\n\u201cI think, miadama, that you need to get out, to explore. Let me guide you in this terrible weather. Let me show you what I know of Venera, for she is the most beautiful and mysterious of cities.\u201d Carlo opens the umbrella, his left hand extended in invitation.\nJana ducks under the umbrella and grabs his arm, unashamedly kneading his strong biceps. She smiles at him, as chastely as she can manage under the circumstances. \u201cThank you. Let\u2019s go!\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cPlease, call me Jana.\u201d\nHe bows his head, \u201cSi, Jana.\u201d\nThey are led to a small booth, near a roaring fireplace. The fire is delicious. Jana closes her eyes and lets the heat caress her face.\nOnce she opens her eyes, she says, \u201cOrder food and wine for us, please. Surprise me. Delight me. It\u2019s all on me, of course. You\u2019ve been so kind.\u201d\nHe starts to protest but catches himself. \u201cIt is you who is so kind.\u201d He gets up, finding the waitress at the bar.\nJana takes in her surroundings. The mood is warm, earthy, intimate. Eschewing electric light, the entire place is lit by fire: candles, lanterns, and, of, course, the fireplace. The walls are of vermilion-red brick and the structure and furniture is some dark brown \u2014 in this light, almost black \u2014 wood. The decor is minimalist: no artwork, no photographs \u2014 although some of the wood panels have carved details; she can\u2019t quite make out the shapes in the near dark, but the flickering light seems to reveal monstrous, nightmarish, even menacing faces. She assumes the horrific character of what she perceives in the carvings is the result of her own somewhat grotesque frame of mind, which Carlo\u2019s charming \u2014 almost too charming \u2014 company has only superficially suppressed.\nCarlo returns. She asks him about this place. \u201cThe Kibbudea is an old establishment,\u201d he explains, pointing to the placemats, on which the name is spelled in Romanesque script under an ornate logo; although Janna cannot grasp what it depicts she is repulsed by its ferocious aura of obscenity, \u201cpredating even the Roman conquest, when the goddess Hecate sent her shapeshifting soldiers to take over the vermilion trade for the empire. Neither Hecate nor the Romans ever did find the gardens. Venera waited them out, and eventually the Romans retreated as their empire collapsed. So, too, the Northern hordes who built their temple to Yggdrasil where now stands the World Tree Hotel hoped to discover the holy secret of the sacred spice and profit from it. Over the centuries, some of the Vikings left, others died out or were assimilated.\u201d\nJana finds none of these digressions interesting. All this superstition about gods and worship \u2026 she tries not to let her irritation show \u2014 Carlo is being so nice to her \u2014 but she sees in his reaction, now that he pauses for breath and takes a good look at her, that he has become aware of her impatience with the directions the conversation has taken.\nClearing his throat, Carlo answers her question more directly: \u201cThe priestesses of the goddess \u2014 the true goddess, Venera herself; not this counterfeit New Age Earth Goddess the current government espouses \u2014 once prepared food for the deity in these kitchens. But there has been no sign of Venera herself for generations. At least since the Nazi occupation. Maybe even before. In her absence, the Kibbudea \u2014 in Classical Veneran that means \u2018food for the goddess\u2019 \u2014 has passed into laic hands.\u201d\nJana fidgets uncomfortably, barely acknowledging Carlo. The near dark, already somewhat disquieting, takes on a suffocating quality; the carvings now appear even more monstrous, inspiring a gnawing, creeping terror. She admonishes herself for being so easily susceptible. \u201cSurely, you don\u2019t believe all this. Shapeshifters? Goddesses?\u201d She regrets her disdainful tone even before the words are out of her.\nCarlo\u2019s face betrays a flash of hurt and anger, which settles into disappointment. He forces a smile. \u201cVenera is like nowhere else on Earth. The gods may be dead everywhere else, but here many of them still thrive, Miadama.\u201d Carlo puts an unmistakable cold emphasis on that formal word of address, announcing to Jana that he\u2019s shutting down the complicity that had been building between them.\nThe wine arrives, interrupting the palpable awkwardness growing between Carlo and Jana. To Jana\u2019s surprise, it\u2019s a mulled wine, served in a glass decanter mounted on a trivet, below which oil burns in a boat-shaped terracotta dish. The wine is so dark, its charred redness is almost black. It smells delicious, its aroma already sumptuously intoxicating.\nCarlo inhales the bouquet of the warm alcohol and instantly \u2014 Jana can see in his face \u2014 snaps back into his persona of the subtle charmer, as if it were an inevitable reflex. Good \u2014 she wants things to thaw again between them. She needs a friend, here in this faraway island and now in these bizarre circumstances. He pours her a drink in a wooden mug into which are carved demonic \u2014 or perhaps angelic? \u2014 figures engaged in an orgy of oral sex. Venera is notorious for this kind of grotesquely erotic artwork. She clutches the warm offering to her chest and, despite her skepticism, is overcome with a sense of ritual, maybe even transcendence. Jana closes her eyes, taking in the rich odors of the wine. In a near-whisper, she tells Carlo, \u201cYou\u2019re right \u2026 Venera is like nowhere else.\u201d As she sips the dark liquid, she notices his gaze soften with a hint of genuine warmth.\nThey sip the wine in companionable silence, for which Jana is grateful. She doesn\u2019t want to say the wrong thing again, and with every sip she feels her inhibitions slip away. In this lightheaded state, she fears it would be too easy for her to let loose some ill-considered words that might again break this comforting illusion of intimacy.\nMeanwhile, the wine continues to weave its spell, making her feel giddy, despite the nagging mysterious unpleasantness with Dean, despite the grotesque surroundings. She recognizes by now that the beverage is laced with vermilion. A small part of her is concerned about once again imbibing the powerful euphoric spice that left her so ill recently, but she suppresses her worries and lets herself relax.\nThe antipasti are brought to the table. Carlo describes it all with the enthusiasm of a sensualist gourmand, but Jana makes no effort to understand. She lets his sensuous words flow like music as she bites into the exotic concoctions, not caring what they are or what they contain. Every bite is a tiny orgasm. Everything is delicious. And everything, she suspects, is laced with yet more vermilion.\nYet more food is served. Every bite is more meltingly succulent than the previous. She hears herself talking, but by now she pays as little attention to her own words as she does to Carlo\u2019s. She cares not at all what they are discussing, or if even anything they say makes any sense. She abandons herself to the euphoria induced by the vermilion \u2026 until she hears Carlo say that name: \u201c\u2026Natasha\u2026\u201d\nJana forces herself to focus, although it\u2019s very difficult. The more she tries to fight the euphoria, the more she tries to concentrate, the more nightmarish hallucinations of sight, sound, and smell gnaw at the edge of her perception. She tries to ignore the subtle terror creeping inside her and asks Carlo, \u201cCan you say that again? What about Natasha?\u201d\n\u201cShe and your man, Dean, were teenage sweethearts. She told me that he left Venera without telling her, without ever writing, without telling her that it was over between them.\u201d\nThis was not entirely a surprise to Jana. \u201cHow did she find him?\u201d\n\u201cFate, Jana. Masara. Or perhaps you would prefer to think of it as coincidence. She has worked at the World Tree Hotel for many years. Longer than I have. She\u2019s a very passionate woman. Perhaps too passionate, I would say.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know all this about her and Dean?\u201d She\u2019s unable to suppress the accusation in her tone.\n\u201cNatasha likes to talk. Especially when she is angry. And she was very angry when she left your room the other day.\u201d\n\u201cHave you seen them together? Or him? Have you seen Dean?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Jana. I do not know where your man is.\u201d\n\u201cTake me to her. Take me to Natasha. She knows. And you know where to find her.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Jana. I cannot do that. Whether or not I know where to find Natasha, it is not my business to intrude on her privacy. Or to involve myself in this drama of yours. You are a stranger here. Your man, Dean, is not. He is Veneran. Perhaps he is where he belongs, now. Perhaps you should return to your home. Forget Venera. I do not mean to be unkind, but I do not think you are well suited to this place.\u201d\nThe monstrous carvings on the walls and ceiling disengage from their perches. They move in the shadows, never allowing her a clear glimpse of their shapes and sizes.\n\u201cYou drugged me on purpose. You\u2019re in on it with her!\u201d\n\u201cNo, Jana. No. There is no plot against you. I am trying to be your friend. But you do not understand life here.\u201d\nFearing for her safety, Jana rises from her seat. She rushes outside without even glancing back. The rain is still torrential. She has no idea how to find the World Tree Hotel. She doesn\u2019t want to go back to her room, though. Maybe there\u2019s a Canadian embassy or consulate, where she could seek refuge. Then take the first boat out to the mainland and fly back home. Save herself.\nShe wanders aimlessly in the rain, shivering down to the bone. How will she ever find her way? She could be anywhere. The whole world is nothing but rain, dense and impenetrable. Rain is all she sees, all she smells, all she feels. It\u2019s as if her own body were dissolving, merging with the downpour.\nStrong arms enfold her. It is Carlo.\n\u201cMiadama. Jana. You will catch your death. Let me bring you back to the hotel.\u201d\nJana feels weak, defeated. She leans into Carlo\u2019s muscular frame and lets him take over, not knowing whether she is saved or doomed. Barely caring which.\nAs soon as she is back at the World Tree and sheltered from the weather, the paranoia once again focuses her mind. She claws at Carlo\u2019s face, drawing blood, and escapes his grip.\nShe runs deeper into the World Tree Hotel, not really knowing what she is running from or where she is running to.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAt some point, probably before she and Carlo reached the World Tree Hotel, Jana lost her handbag. Along with her room key, her money, and her passport.\nJana needs to think her way out of this. She\u2019s aware that the vermilion is still influencing her perceptions but unsure to what extent reality is being distorted by the drug. Still, there must be a way out of this nightmare. The pressure on her bladder makes it impossible for her to concentrate. Seeing no other option, as all the doors are locked to her, she squats against a wall and relieves herself.\nThe deserted hallway now reeks with the musk of her piss. But Jana has regained some clarity of mind. She must locate the lobby. And from there get a word to Canadian authorities and find her way off this island. Carlo was right. She has to forget Dean and return home. There\u2019s nothing for her here.\nIn time, desperation once again clouds her mind. No matter how far she walks, Jana cannot escape the stench of urine \u2014 and worse. She peers at the floor in the near dark. With increasing frequency, she finds suspicious wet spots, piles of feces, rotting carcasses of small mammals and lizards. Gradually, the halls no longer look merely cavernous; gradually, the signs of civilization are stripped from her surroundings. No matter which direction she takes, Jana steps farther into a maze of narrowing caverns. Iridescent vermilion veins crisscross the surface of the rock walls, providing faint illumination. She had believed vermilion to originate from a plant, but here it appears to be a mineral.\nAware that she is straying deeper and deeper into the bowels of Venera and farther away from any possible exit, Jana tries to climb back up to the surface, but the labyrinth defeats her. Regardless of the direction she attempts to take, Jana continues her unwilling descent.\nShe has moved beyond the zone of decay and animal waste. The air is getting damper, almost palpable. It is not dank, however, but numinously clean \u2014 like breathing psychotropically potent mineral water: at once reinvigorating and heady, refreshing and dizzying, bringing about both clarity and confusion.\nHer surroundings are now in perpetual transformation, taking on configurations she can neither recognize nor fully comprehend. Sometimes, her situation no longer seems claustrophobic. Vast alien subterranean vistas open up before her, exotic formations \u2014 which she cannot distinguish as fauna, flora, mineral, or artificial \u2014 spread outward for unfathomable distances. And then, with a step, her world shrinks again to a confining tunnel. The only constant is the faint burnt-orange glow of the strains of vermilion illuminating every surface.\nJana now stands at a threshold. At her feet are gigantic roots emanating from the chamber before her. The roots break through the stony ground, burrowing deeper still into the earth.\nThere\u2019s the flickering light of a fire coming from inside. Its warmth beckons her. Its aroma is intoxicatingly familiar: vermilion.\nShe steps inside. At first, her senses are drawn to the flames of the vermilion fire. On the ground rests a large terracotta pot onto which is carved the weird, obscene logo of the Kibbudea; the reddish flames that sprout from the vessel make the air inside the chamber shimmer, as if the reality revealed by the firelight was not any more substantial than a projected image.\nAnd here, having abandoned any desire to locate him, she finds Dean. His naked body is chained to the trunk of a giant tree. Blood leaks from multiple small wounds in his flesh, running down the bark into the soil. The roots near where the blood pools pulse like veins.\nKneeling before the tree is a naked woman with long, dark hair. She turns her neck to greet Jana with a solemn nod. Jana recognizes the maid, Natasha, Dean\u2019s former lover.\nIn Natasha\u2019s hand is a dagger made of wood. She plunges the dagger into the ceremonial fire. The flames roll over the dagger and the bare skin of her hand, but it does not burn. She pulls out the dagger, which is now incandescent with vermilion, as is her hand. She reaches toward Dean and with the dagger cuts two small slivers of flesh from his calf.\nDean moans slightly, as if he were dreaming.\nNatasha stares at Jana, but the meaning of the Veneran\u2019s stoic gaze is impenetrable.\nAlthough her head is spinning from inhaling the vermilion fumes, Jana makes a decision. It feels as if she has no other option: she disrobes and joins the other woman.\nNatasha hands a slice of Dean\u2019s flesh to Jana, keeping the other for herself. At the same time, they consume the meat of their common lover.\nNatasha presents the wooden dagger to Jana. Splinters dig into the palm of her hand as she grips it firmly. With the intrusion of the slivers of wood into her flesh comes communion with Yggdrasil, from whose bark, it is thus revealed to her, the dagger was formed.\nThe flesh Jana carves with this dagger is hers to ingest; but not the blood that flows from the wounds. The blood seeps into the soil, sustaining the World Tree.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue26\/3lbe26_story1.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"For the past five days, as the cruise ship <em>Venusian<\/em> languorously travelled the Mediterranean from Barcelona to Venera, the weather had been perfect: bright blue skies tempered by the occasional white cloud with not a hint of rain; never dipping below fifteen degrees centigrade at night, never going above twenty-five in the daytime; a steady breeze that carried the mesmerizing aroma of the sea.","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/OAWJzZIh390ZtVlNur-+b+nA+VY.json"}

Right after college. I had an Art degree that didn\u2019t mean for shit, but it was four years of room and board for free. After that I had to do something, and I didn\u2019t want to go back to Pine Ridge. There ain\u2019t nothing there.\nThe houses were mostly all right. The spirits would be like they were anyplace else: some good, some bad, and some just bored and looking to stir up trouble. You leave them a splash of Coke and some white-bread baloney sandwich on a napkin, they give you all the talk \u2014 who was sleeping around, where the pot was hidden, all that. Mostly what the spirits are is nosy.\nBut there was this one place, a real bad place, that I remember.\nThe worst part was, I was out of cigarettes. It was a bad day and we were running behind, and I smoked the last one on the way over.\nIt was five o\u2019clock, and we still had one house to do, so the lady I was working with, her name was Janice, we figured to rush through it. I asked if we could stop for another pack of before we went in, but she had to get home and eat. She had Celiac\u2019s and had trouble finding anything to eat back then. I felt bad for her, so we just went to this last place to get it over with.\nLater on, I found out from the office manager it belonged to a prison guard and his wife and they had a couple of Rottweilers that had scared the office manager half to death. Tried to bite her. She told \u2019em they couldn\u2019t be home when we cleaned. None of them. I wish she would of said what the place was like before we went in there.\nThe place was a one-story brown house surrounded by a chain-link fence woven with tin strips and two big bushes spanning the whole front yard except for the front step. Even on the outside, it smelled like wet dog and something else, something bad. A meat smell, old and greasy. The windows were covered with bars on the outside and tinfoil inside. We went in, using a key from the office manager. The door had a rubber seal on the bottom that scraped on the floor. You had to wonder what they were trying to keep out, or keep in. Oh, yeah, and there were about a hundred beware of dog signs in the front yard.\nWe turned on the lights. Everything was dirty and looked about twenty years too old, like it came from the seventies or somewhere off the reservation. The carpet was brown and torn out in places. It had claw marks down to the wood underneath. The kitchen was gross. A layer of grease over everything. I went to check the toilet and the door was broken. A hole torn right through the wood, with short black dog hair stuck to it.\nThe way it worked was, you either had the wet or the dry for the day. The wet was the toilets and the kitchen, and anyplace you had to wash the floor. The dry was the rest of the house, and all the vacuuming. You had different kits you had to drag around with you, wet and dry. My partner Janice liked to do wet so I had dry most of the time.\nI started at the last room at the end of the hallway. You were supposed to start at the back and leave out the front door, so there wouldn\u2019t be any footprints in the carpets. Like not having footprints in the carpets proved that you\u2019d cleaned the house or something.\nI walked into the room and turned on the light. It was the master bedroom with a big king-sized bed and all, too much furniture shoved into too little space, like they got it on sale or from their grandma.\nIt was a long time ago, and I thought I was a tough little Indian back then.\nBut as soon as I turned on that light, I knew I wasn\u2019t tough for shit. I wasn\u2019t even as tough as wet dog shit to scrape off your shoe.\nThe deal was, the room was covered in blood, I mean like it was wet wall paint. The bed was soaked with it. There was a bad mattress under the quilt, too, with a deep holed filled to the brim with blood. The only thing that didn\u2019t have blood on it was the TV screen. They had a big one, a projection screen. You didn\u2019t see a lot of those back then. You could see the streaks where the blood had been wiped off. And if that wasn\u2019t enough, there was some kind of raw skin stuck to the wall over the head of the bed.\n\u201cHey Janice,\u201d I yelled. \u201cCome see this!\u201d\nShe gave this big sigh from the toilet and started marching out with footsteps like an elephant. She was maybe five foot tall and a hundred and eighty pounds. She used to weigh more, but she\u2019d lost a lot of weight from Celiac\u2019s.\nShe came in and said, \u201cWhat you want?\u201d\nJanice couldn\u2019t see spirits. She couldn\u2019t see nothing. She was pure deaf and blind as far as spirits were concerned. Although, sometimes she acted like she could smell them.\nI pointed at the skin over the bed. To my eyes, it looked like someone had taken the skin off a deformed pig and spread it out on the wall. It was spattered with blood except for a pair of white teeth sticking out from its flat jaw.\n\u201cWhat do you think of that?\u201d I said.\nShe just shrugged at me. \u201cIt\u2019s a wolf skin, Carrie. So what? The guy seems like the hunter type.\u201d\n\u201cKind of kinky to have it hanging over the bed. Watching you.\u201d\nShe snorted. \u201cThat some kind of Native American taboo? About wolves watching you during sex?\u201d\n\u201cNah, I just thought it was kinda weird.\u201d\nShe went back to the toilet and I heard the sink running. She\u2019d do that when she didn\u2019t want to talk to you.\nI took out my dustwand and brushed it over the corners of the ceiling. I couldn\u2019t tell whether it was doing any good. All I could see was the blood.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d she said.\nI told her I needed a cigarette.\nShe said, \u201cAnd I need something to eat. So get your ass in gear.\u201d\nI tried to hurry, vacuuming the bedrooms while she dusted the living room, but everywhere I went, I felt something watching me. The walls were mostly fake wood, that shiny pressboard stuff you used to find in old trailer houses. The only pictures were some old paint-by-number pictures of trees and deer hanging in the hallway. I didn\u2019t like them. It felt like something was hiding in the white cracks in the paint.\nThere were two other bedrooms. The second had a sign on the door: KEEP OUT. I didn\u2019t even look inside. The last was kind of a kid\u2019s room, kind of not. There was a twin bed with a faded train quilt, and about ten cardboard boxes stacked on top. Three of the boxes said DOGS and one said JIMMY and the rest weren\u2019t marked, just folded shut. Except for one that was open. I brushed over the top of them with my dust wand but that was it. It felt like a trap. Also they looked like they were leaking blood all over the place.\nAfter I finished dusting everything I went back to vacuum the master bedroom. The toilet stank of window cleaner and floor cleaner and shower cleaner, ten times as much as anybody needed to use, and I knew that Janice\u2019s nose was telling her something was wrong. But I didn\u2019t say nothing. It wasn\u2019t going to get us out of that house any sooner. Instead I started vacuuming that room.\nI vacuumed under the bed and the desk and was vacuuming the rest of the floor in these long, straight lines, when I heard something rattle up into the tube.\nI turned the vacuum off right away, but it was too late. Whatever it was had already sucked up into the bag.\nJanice yelled, \u201cWell, shit!\u201d\nIt would have been easier if they had the clear-barrel vacuums like you can get now. If I\u2019d been able to see, I woulda got the hell out of the house. As it was, I unzipped the bag cover and pulled out the paper bag without thinking about it.\nThe bag was stuffed with all kinds of dog hair, short and black and wet-smelling. Right away my hands and arms started to itch. I gritted my teeth and reached in.\nJanice came up behind me. \u201cTell me it wasn\u2019t a wedding ring. Just tell me.\u201d\nMy fingers felt swollen from the dog hair, I was breaking out so bad. \u201cGo get me the scissors. I\u2019m gonna cut this bag open.\u201d\nJanice always kept a pair of scissors in her kit, ones she\u2019d bought herself. They were the heavy kind you used to cut up chicken bones.\nSoon as she left, my fingers touched something.\nIt was dry and flaky and tough, like something you\u2019d throw to a dog to chew on, only it was warm. I flinched back from it, wiped my hand on my pants, and waited for Janice to come back with the scissors.\nJanice rattled around in her kit in the living room, then cursed. \u201cI left them out in the damn car!\u201d she shouted. The front door opened with a scrape, then closed again.\nI didn\u2019t like being alone in that house. The hair stood up on the back of my neck. I started whimpering and shaking. The last thing I wanted to do was see whatever was in that bag, but I couldn\u2019t stand just sitting there, either.\nI screwed my eyes shut, stuffed my fingers into the hole, and pushed up on the bottom of the bag with my other hand. The thing was small and withered and hard, and all of a sudden I knew just what it was. I jumped and it got away from me, sliding down into the dust and the dog hair, and I couldn\u2019t feel it anymore, no matter how much I squished around.\nI dropped the bag and ran, dragging the vacuum with me. I had to get out.\nJanice had thrown everything out of her kit onto the living room carpet looking for those scissors. I started to toss everything back in. It was mostly squirt bottles and dirty, wet rags that\u2019d probably been down the toilet. I didn\u2019t care. I was getting out of there.\nJust as I picked up her kit, something grabbed me on the back of my neck. It was strong as hell, and hot, thick wet liquid dripped down the back of my neck.\nI whimpered. It was a spirit, a real bad one. I was lucky I didn\u2019t pee myself.\nI said, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to, please let me go.\u201d\nBut it just dug in its claws.\n\u201cYou bitch, taking master\u2019s property,\u201d it growled at me.\nI shook and cried so hard there were boogers running down my face. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault. It got sucked up into the vacuum cleaner.\u201d\n\u201cThieves always say not my fault.\u201d\nIt breathed in my ear and rubbed its claws on my neck. Something nudged me on the ass. It wasn\u2019t hard to figure out what it wanted.\nYou don\u2019t last long on the reservation by putting up with that shit. First they think they got you. And then the claws come out.\nI threw my head back and slammed into its snout. Then I swung my elbow into its side. Some people say you can\u2019t hurt a spirit, but that\u2019s not true. I wrapped my arm around its arms and punched a fist into its side again. It yipped like a dog. Then its dark, leathery skin disappeared under my fist and I was left punching air as the door opened.\nJanice walked in. Of course she hadn\u2019t seen nothing. \u201cThe hell you doing?\u201d she said, putting her hand on one hip. She liked to think she was Roseanne Barr. \u201cPracticing your karate moves?\u201d\n\u201cI got bored waiting for you.\u201d I was panting hard. I wiped the back of my neck, trying to get the wetness off, but a long stream of it was already running down my shirt. I walked into the kitchen and ran my hand under the faucet, then I stole a paper towel and ran it along my back, under my uniform. It came away covered in bloody spit. I threw the paper towel away in the garbage can under the sink, then pulled it out and stuck it in my pants pocket instead. The small white garbage bag was empty and I didn\u2019t want to risk leaving anything behind.\nThe scissors sliced across each other in the living room. Janice was opening up that bag.\n\u201cWait,\u201d I said, \u201cLet me\u2014\u201d\nBut she ignored me and tore open the bag. \u201cI\u2019m too hungry to wait on your slow ass.\u201d\nI rushed out to her. She sat on the floor, cross-legged with the bag in her lap. It was pulled open like a bag of microwave popcorn, full of gray dust and wads of dog hair, and she was rooting around in it.\nHer nose wrinkled. \u201cSmells like you vacuumed up dog shit.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d I said.\nThe spirit was right behind her, standing on all fours. Its black leathery skin was made of scars. Its ears were bent forward like chicken wings. Its feet ended in claws, not just dog claws but like the tendons had been cut between its toes. Its tail was nothing but a lump.\nIts mouth dripped blood.\nIt stood on its hind legs again. \u201cTwo thieves,\u201d it growled. \u201cTwo bitches in the house.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Janice said. \u201cI got something on me? What you staring at me for?\u201d\nI swallowed a big lump of dry spit. \u201cYou got a spider on you.\u201d\nWell, that did it. She flung the bag across the room and screamed, slapping her hands across her back and shoulders and rubbing her hair so hard it pulled out of her skinny ponytail. She damn near knocked the spirit over. It stumbled backward into a corkboard hanging on the wall by the door, and a bunch of papers fell down in a big clump. The spirit slipped on them, leaving a bloody footprint.\nIt dropped back on all fours, clicking its claws on the tile. Then it shook its head, spraying blood.\nJanice screamed, \u201cGet it off! Get it off!\u201d\nI grabbed her and acted like I was brushing at her hair. \u201cHold still! Hold still!\u201d\nAll I could think of was getting out. But that spirit was between us and the front door. I pushed Janice down the hall toward the toilet and flipped on the light. The circulation fan started wheezing. I shoved her towards the shower stall and shut the door. The walls in there were covered with blood, too, but the mirror was clean, and so were the shower and the toilet.\nI ripped off a handful of toilet paper, tearing off that stupid little triangle they made us fold at the end. I grabbed Janice\u2019s ponytail and scrubbed her hair with the toilet paper. Then I wadded it up and threw it in the toilet and flushed before Janice could see there was nothing there.\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d she said. \u201cDid you get it? Did you get it? What was it?\u201d\nI pretended it wasn\u2019t a big deal. \u201cJust a spider. If you would have held still I could have got it off right away.\u201d\nShe was just about crying. \u201cBut I can\u2019t hold still for spiders. Why did you even tell me? You could have flicked it off and not told me at all.\u201d\n\u201cIt was going down your shirt.\u201d\nShe grabbed the edges of the sink and leaned forward. Her shoulders jerked a coupla times. Then she spat into the sink and turned the water on, splashing water around the basin to wash her spit down. She musta been real hungry. There was just nothing to come up.\n\u201cGood thing you didn\u2019t eat yet,\u201d I said.\n\u201cFuck you,\u201d she said. The fat under her arms shook.\nOutside the door I could hear the spirit breathing. I felt bad for it. It hadn\u2019t started out that way. But I guess being in that house for so long, it took in all the badness the way ceiling tiles take in cigarette smoke. First the tiles turn yellow, then brown, and finally black.\nJanice reached for the door handle. I could only think of one way to stop her.\n\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d I said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a spider. I just had to get you away from that bag.\u201d\nJanice looked at me in the mirror. A streak on the mirror seemed to cover her cheek with blood. \u201cWhy?\u201d she growled. \u201cWhat\u2019s in there?\u201d\nI felt it under my fingertips like I was touching it again. Dry and leathery, with hard ridges and a waxy feel in the deep spots.\n\u201cAn ear,\u201d I said. \u201cA dried, human ear.\u201d\n\u201cThe fuck you say,\u201d she said. I couldn\u2019t blame her, either.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to see it,\u201d I said. \u201cI was hoping I was just wrong.\u201d\nJanice kicked the door open. The spirit was right there in front of her, in the hallway, drooling blood onto the carpet in long, spitty ropes. The door slammed in its face, and I thought it would attack her. But she walked right through it and down the hall.\n\u201cYou\u2019re in for it now,\u201d I told the spirit. \u201cShe\u2019ll call the cops on your master.\u201d\n\u201cMaster kill you,\u201d it growled.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Janice said.\n\u201cTalking to the spirits,\u201d I said.\n\u201cRight. Oh, great spirits, keep this fucking Indian from falling apart on me before I get home and get something to eat.\u201d\nShe bent over, sticking her fat ass in the air, and picked up the bag from the floor. But I could already see where the ear had gone. It had flown out of the bag and landed on the couch.\n\u201cMaster said to kill all thieves,\u201d the spirit growled. Master was master, that was all, same as a regular dog. It stalked slowly towards Janice. I followed it down the hallway, edging from side to side, trying to see if I could get around it.\nThe spirit stopped at the end of the hall. I danced back and forth, trying to work up the courage to push past it.\n\u201cGood boy,\u201d I said. \u201cWho\u2019s a good boy?\u201d\nThe hell if its cut-off tail didn\u2019t move once or twice. It stopped growling for a second. Then it started again.\nJanice dropped the bag back on the floor, put her hands on her back, and straightened up. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything.\u201d\nHer head turned. She was looking at the couch.\n\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not just some pig\u2019s ear chew toy.\u201d\nThen she reached for it.\nThe spirit leaned back on its hind legs, getting ready to pounce.\nI jumped on its back and dug my fingers into its shoulders. I tried getting my arms around its throat, but it was as big as a bear.\nThe spirit flew forward and jumped onto Janice\u2019s ass. She slammed into the carpet with her arms spread wide out. I couldn\u2019t tell how badly she was hurt, because the spirit kept running across her and straight into the wall, trying and throw me. My head hit the wall, but at least I got one arm around its neck.\n\u201cBad dog!\u201d I shouted. \u201cDown, boy. Down!\u201d I didn\u2019t know what else to say, and I was dizzy from slamming into the wall.\n\u201cNot Master! Not Master!\u201d the spirit growled at me.\nIt bucked and kicked and twisted around and tried to bite me. In about a second it was going to remember it could stand up and pull me off.\nI got my other arm around its neck, locked my fist over my other wrist, and jerked backwards like I was going to throw myself off. I didn\u2019t, though. I kept my legs locked around its sides. I wasn\u2019t going anywhere if I could help it.\nThe spirit choked. It rolled on the ground, knocking the air out of me, then got back on its feet.\n\u201cBad dog!\u201d I yelled again. But it didn\u2019t come out much more than a whisper. \u201cDown! Sit!\u201d\n\u201cNot Master!\u201d\nIt ran into the wall again. That time I saw stars.\nI knew I couldn\u2019t hang on much longer. My arms were burning and I\u2019d be unconscious soon.\nSo I let go.\nI rolled off and into the TV. I grabbed it before it could tip over. I knew that no matter what else happened, I didn\u2019t want to be breaking that TV. As soon as I had it steady, I turned around. The spirit was guarding that couch, leaning back on its hind legs again, ready to jump me. Janice lay on the floor, her back covered with bloody dog footprints and bloody dog drool.\nI stood up as straight and as tall as I could. And I thought about my ancestors. I had never seen one, just spirits. But all the same I imagined them lined them up in rows behind me.\n\u201cBad dog,\u201d I said, pointing at it like I was selling hellfire at some church. \u201cYou get down right now.\u201d\nIt jumped for my throat.\nI punched the spirit\u2019s nose with my forearm. Its jaw clicked shut and butted into my chest. It missed my throat but the weight carried us backwards into the TV.\nThe TV slid off its stand and I landed with my head against the wall. Luckily I didn\u2019t break the TV or my butt would have been cut to shreds. The spirit took its jaw out of my armpit and snapped at my face. Its breath smelled like stale cigarettes or the smell in the fall when it rains and all the earthworms come out on the sidewalks to die.\nIt lunged for my throat again but I got an arm up in its jaw, back behind its teeth. It clamped down but I pushed back with my arm and it started gagging. There was blood everywhere, all over my shirt, coming from the spirit\u2019s mouth, coming from my arm.\nWith my free hand I grabbed the spirit\u2019s ear. It didn\u2019t just look like a dried-out chicken wing, it felt like one. Some kind of infection make the skin sticky and waxy. I gagged but I held on as hard as I could and twisted.\nI felt bad even as I was doing it. The spirit was just doing what its master told it. It howled around a mouthful of my arm and tried to let go, but I wouldn\u2019t let it.\nAny second it would start shaking its head and snap my arm if I didn\u2019t back off, so I pushed on its jaw again. It was killing me to make myself push down harder on those teeth digging into my arm, but I did it.\nAs I pushed I could see the skin inside its mouth, wet and pink with black speckles. Its teeth were all red with blood. Its eyes were so wide you could see the whites around the these gold-gray eyes. They looked sad and scared, now that I was looking at them up close. It gagged around my arm and tried to get away.\nI pushed the spirit\u2019s mouth until it had all four feet on the floor. Then I twisted its ear even harder, and it howled. I jerked my arm free. Then I grabbed the vacuum cleaner. My hand was by then, and I almost dropped it. I\u2019m pretty sure if I would have, I\u2019da been dead now.\nBut I didn\u2019t. I slammed the base across the back of its neck. The spirit sank down on its forepaws, whimpering like a puppy.\n\u201cBad dog!\u201d I shouted. I wiped my hand on my pants and slammed the spirit across the neck again. \u201cBad dog! Get down!\u201d\nWhat was left of its ears flattened down, and it crouched low, wrinkling up its scarred leathery face.\n\u201cDon\u2019t hurt, Master. Don\u2019t hurt.\u201d\nI lowered the vacuum. The spirit stayed low. Its nub of a tail started wagging, and I had to look away. I looked at the TV instead. It was too heavy for me to lift by myself, but at least it wasn\u2019t broken. There was blood everywhere, and not just spirit blood. My arm was ripped open.\nFrom the floor, Janice said, \u201cFuck,\u201d then slowly started to get up.\nThe ear was still on the couch.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cThe fuck happened in there?\u201d she said.\n\u201cBad spirits,\u201d I said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see anything, did you?\u201d\n\u201cJust that ear.\u201d\n\u201cThat was real.\u201d\n\u201cWe gotta call the cops,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they ain\u2019t going to believe any of your Indian bullshit. So you just keep your mouth shut. The story is, they had a dog hiding in the bedroom. It attacked you and I chased it off. Neither one of us knows what happened to it.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThey got a dried ear in their house. Who\u2019s going to believe that they didn\u2019t have another dog?\u201d\nWe stopped to get rid of some pot she had in her glove box, in case the truck was searched. And then we went back to the house.\nJanice called the police. She said she was the one who had vacuumed up that ear. She wasn\u2019t taking credit, it was just better if the old white woman found it, not me. Less for the cops to argue with.\nThen she called the office manager. We didn\u2019t know if we would get fired or what. I started to worry that the owners would come back, and I broke out in a cold sweat. Luckily the next time someone pulled up in front of the house, it was the cops, not just one or two, either. I think they sent every cop in town to check it out.\nJanice got an award and a bonus. I got nothing. Except Janice gave me part of the money later on. Not quite half but enough for a three-hundred-dollar beater and a tank of gas.\nI didn\u2019t buy a car. I thought about it. I bought a couple of dogs from the pound instead, two Rottweilers that showed up one day with their ears all scarred up. In the end I couldn\u2019t do much for them. They never trusted nobody but each other, dog or human. But I kept them until they finally both let their last breaths go and went to sleep.\nSometimes I leave them cut-up hot dogs on a napkin and a splash of Coke, just like they used to like.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue26\/3lbe26_story5.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"My family didn't come from medicine men or anyone like that.

B is for bell.\nA woman waits at the counter. I\u2019ve never seen her in the shop before. I put down the dental floss and go ring her up, keeping an eye on the carnations. They\u2019re awful-looking with their color frank and flat. As are the bills of change I hand back to her\u2014and if we had any doubt, the powder blue nail polish I\u2019m wearing has turned electric. I can tell the moment she notices. She stiffens minutely. Then walks away without making eye contact.\nOut in the street a man in a business suit sprints by, acid green tie flapping over his shoulder.\nThe carnations don\u2019t seem like flowers anymore. They are illustrations of mutated, exploded apples. Viruses with no DNA of their own. Just protein, just red.\nI know it\u2019s time to go.\nI leave through the front door, locking up after myself even though I\u2019m about to loot the stockroom. This building is unusual. It was built with no thought that the glassfront business on the ground floor might need a back room.\nWe negotiated one. It\u2019s in Mrs. Lower\u2019s cellar, and we get to it by walking up the stairs to the building\u2019s main door, through the vestibule with the little brass mailboxes (including mine), down the hall on the left, through the door to her apartment (which she leaves unlocked during business hours), through what she calls her \u201cfoyer\u201d with the big gilt mirror (hung at exactly the right angle to give me a heart attack when I glimpse my orange reflection dart by), through a trapdoor in her kitchen (that she leaves open), and down a set of fold-out stairs. The floor of her cellar is about head-height if you were standing in the shop.\nThe bees are riled up. She houses them in apiaries hung outside her window sills. We sell the honey for her; it\u2019s a Bistou\u2019s Convenience bestseller. Her place reeks of insecticide.\n\u201cMrs. Lower?\u201d I call, as a courtesy. \u201cI\u2019m going to the stockroom!\u201d\nNo answer, just my own wide face in the mirror crowned by yellow-yellow bees. Her windows are covered with aluminum foil and plastic wrap to keep them out\u2014ha. And she only uses orange light bulbs.\n\u201cFor my complexion,\u201d she says. \u201cThis wavelength zaps acne bacteria and also stimulates collagen production.\u201d\nIt makes everything in her apartment look like that sickly sweet, artificially-flavored fever reducer for children. But it has no effect on the bees, today. They are purest yellow. When something is that emotionless and aggressive, be scared. The color, I\u2019m talking about. Not the bees. They swim around lazily.\nIt is the color that is losing its normal affect, becoming zombie yellow, zombie blue. I hadn\u2019t ever thought of color as having an emotional life\u2014lives, moods\u2014until a few minutes ago, until the carnations. The world is different now.\nI\u2019m in the stockroom slitting cardboard boxes open and pawing through them. There\u2019s a dusty tapestry bag stashed in the corner. I won\u2019t be able to stomach the pattern, the colors.\nAnd there\u2019s the fact that I\u2019ll be stealing it from Mrs. Lower.\nBut fine.\nChocolate bars, oatmeal cookies, wafers, cured meat, dried fruit, warm flat lemonade, warm flat water all go into the bag. I barely remember tampons. Better get out there before it becomes a stampede.\nI go back. I get stung on the neck.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI liked it when her kids grew up enough to groan and eyeroll her when she got on the subject. Especially at the dinner table. She\u2019d see something on a news flyer and start lecturing about drugs and murders and stolen babies and how society is supposed to function. When refugees come to a new place, they affect it. People go crazy.\nMeanwhile, we\u2019re trying to eat.\n\u201cMom,\u201d say Will and Jean, \u201cwell-trod ground.\u201d A favorite phrase of their father\u2019s, my brother\u2019s, but Will Sr. doesn\u2019t use it with his wife (he\u2019s too mild, which sounds nice and is, except when he is being a coward). I find their use of it hilarious.\nThe way she goes on, you\u2019d think she had a baby stolen. But both her kids are right here, perfectly safe and with healthy appetites. She talks until the chorus drowns her out. Teenagers aren\u2019t afraid of yelling.\n\u201cWell, okay,\u201d she says, eventually, flapping her hands over the normal-green green beans as though shooing away the topic. \u201cBut in this family, at least, we know what\u2019s right. Don\u2019t we?\u201d\nGod, green beans. What a nice, empathetic green, a green that\u2019s about chlorophyll and sunshine and steam over boiling water on the stove. I never know whether she\u2019s including me when she uses the word family.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t travel. And we don\u2019t want refugees coming here. End of story.\u201d\nThe actual story is ongoing, old and a little boring. Refugees have been quietly trickling in for years, probably generations. They are blamed for things because they are strange in ways no one likes to talk about.\nI don\u2019t think Ann knows that I met one. It was long ago, maybe thirty years, and I only remember scraps. It\u2019s possible Will (Sr.) has told her, and she\u2019s deliberately angling to hurt me when she says things about how \u201cthis family\u201d would never have anything to do with them. It\u2019s also possible that because of the circumstances around what happened to me, she thinks I\u2019m on her side.\nBut I bet she has no idea.\nAll I know is that the green I see in trees and window boxes and the alley garden next to the 57th Street Laundromatica has shut up. It is dead. And I for one am not going to hang around and watch it start to bleed.\nI have a cramp in my side from lugging the tapestry bag. The plastic bottles of water and lemonade roll around inside, making it difficult to get into a jogging rhythm. Most people are going faster than me.\nIf I believed that bleaching was real, I guess I should have stayed in shape for it?\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nNo one knows what\u2019s Out, beyond the forest.\nAfter thirty blocks, I don\u2019t recognize the shops, the buildings. I\u2019ve never been this way before, never had any reason to go this far Out. Twelve more and I discover that the city streets end at a red chain-link fence. Below it is a concrete retaining wall, a ten-foot drop to the plain beyond. The fence is just like the ones around the pens at the City Zoological Society. Those are to keep the peacocks and black bears and such away from visitors. I guess this one is here to keep people from emigrating. It\u2019s hard to look at it.\nWe are milling around, many of us sweaty and winded, wearing the wrong shoes for this. Some give up and go home, shoulders slumped. Others throw their things over and start to climb. I hear someone crying\u2014I push my way up to the fence and see a man sitting on the dirty ground below the retaining wall, ten feet below me. His back is against the wall; he clutches his ankle as blood seeps through his sock. The color is worse than the red paint of the fence. Blood is life, even when it\u2019s pouring out of you.\nI\u2019m glad I can\u2019t see mine right now.\nSirens. The City Official must be panicking. They\u2019ll want to stop a mass exodus. I\u2019m hot, tired, breathing hard. Rivulets of sweat run down my legs inside my pants (I hope it\u2019s sweat). I want desperately to just sit and wait for them to round me up.\nIt takes me two tries to throw my tapestry bag over the fence. My body is larger than most of the people trying to climb, but I am determined. And I make it over. I am careful on the descent.\nI leave my bottle of water for the man with the broken ankle. The City Official will take him. Though I suspect there isn\u2019t much time left for anyone here.\nI start out over the bare dirt field. The earth still has its numen, its bright sandy scatteredness and its deep damp good, although it is littered with old cans and scraps of news flyers in psychopath colors.\nEventually I'm walking over scraggly grass. The weeds look okay, natural.\n\u201cHey.\u201d Someone tugs my sleeve. At first I think it\u2019s that customer who noticed my nail polish earlier. But it\u2019s someone else, a woman who comes into the shop a couple times a month. She buys clementines and dark morning tea. Or maybe they\u2019re the same person.\nI grunt back. There should be more of us out here. How many have escaped, a couple thousand? Three? Does she recognize me?\n\u201cHey,\u201d says the clementine woman again. \u201cYou can\u2019t go straight Out. Angle to Morning.\u201d\nRight. Anyone will tell you that, not just Ann. Never go too far In or too far Out. The world doesn\u2019t end in those directions, and whatever the implications of that may be (no one says), to quote Will Sr., it\u2019s well-trod ground. There are others living there who don\u2019t want to be crowded. Just as we don\u2019t want to be, by people from In.\nThe rumors of bleaching come from In. Always from In. The most efficient way to outrun it should be to go straight Out, no? Especially as I\u2019m slow.\nThe clementine woman is about twenty yards ahead and has angled sharply toward Morning. There\u2019s the forest; I can see the tree line in the distance. It looks great. The green is looking at me how my mother used to.\nI have to make it to the trees. Morning won\u2019t be safe. It\u2019s Out for me. I have to reach the forest before I collapse.\nThey say that eventually the mutated colors bleed away , that all textures flatten and become smooth, like perfect glass.\nI don\u2019t look back.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI down the last of the lemonade. The warm sugar irritates my throat and makes me thirstier, even as the forest quenches my eyes.\nDid Will and Jean run? They eyeroll Ann, but in the end, did they believe her? Did my brother? With a horrible, retching certainty, it hits me that they did. I wish I had spoken up more at those family dinners.\nWell, I\u2019m a coward and I didn\u2019t save anybody. I should feel some way about that.\nOr\u2014maybe it got me? Am I a little bleached now, a little too bright, losing some of my emotional capacity? Maybe my insides are going smooth, maybe my period is the last of my good old blood coming out.\nI force myself to keep walking, because what else?\nI remember when Will Sr. was just plain Will. When he was Will Bistou, my older brother and already mild, but not yet what they call retiring. He used to take me to the Zoological Society to look at the black bears and the tame coyote and the one-winged bald eagle hopping around her red chain-link enclosure barking for mice. Some farmer had shot her in the wing.\nThe Zoological Society kept the same animals but always changed the placards, so you never knew what you were going to read about.\ndid you know?\nbald eagles have more eyelids than you think.\n\u201cSo now I have to think about animal eyelids,\u201d Will sighs. \u201cThis place sure is asking a lot of me.\u201d\n\u201cThe nick\u2026 nick-i-ti\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNictitating.\u201d Will corrects me. His voice is lazy, humming out of him like a slow bee.\n\u201c\u2014membrane is a clear second eyelid that helps keep the eagles\u2019 eyeballs clean and moist and they can close it and still see through it. Wow,\u201d I say. \u201cVery alien.\u201d\nWill shrugs. We follow the line of placards along the fence. We pass the zookeepers\u2019 hut. There are little holes in the concrete where people have stuck gum. I\u2019m young enough, I put my fingers in to touch it\u2014smooth and petrified.\nplease don\u2019t touch the wall.\nWill continues to read.\ngum is not allowed on zoological society grounds.\nstop it with the gum!\ni mean it! doesn\u2019t anybody read the signs?!\nHe chuckles to himself.\njust as extinct animals have left fossils behind in the ground, the human species is preparing for its eventual obliteration by leaving nasty pieces of chewed-up indigestibles in these holes. as these artifacts preserve information such as molar shape and a tendency to disregard official signage, i am no longer cleaning them out and putting them where they should go, in the trash along with the rest of you awful people .\ndid you know?\nthe human brain is about 60% fat. it\u2019s the fattiest organ in the whole body. makes you think.\n\u201cOh great,\u201d says Will, \u201cmore thinking.\u201d\nI just laugh.\nThe latest sign is a different size and color. It\u2019s difficult to tell whether it is an official Zoological Society placard.\ndid you know?\ni can\u2019t wait for all of you to get bleached.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the last one,\u201d I say. \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d\nHe holds out his hand and I take it, feeling special. No one else has an eight-years-older brother who takes such good care of them. He\u2019s not your natural brother, though, they say. And your mom isn\u2019t your mom. (Later, Ann would not let me forget it.)\nWe\u2019re almost home when I ask. \u201cWhat was the last one talking about?\u201d\n\u201cThe zoologist was insulting us as a species.\u201d\nOne thing I know about Will, even at the age of nine, is that he tends to assume people already have the answers to the questions they ask him. So he answers you from a few steps ahead, which a lot of times ends up being from behind again.\n\u201cI know that.\u201d You have to ask him directly. \u201cWhat\u2019s getting bleached?\u201d\nWill scratches his head. \u201cIt\u2019s just a rumor, probably.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t mean to deliberately withhold information. I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s just his dear way of getting tangled in conversation. He keeps tripping over the one thing you want to know.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I say, \u201cI know that too. But what is it? What happens when you get bleached?\u201d\n\u201cOh, people say colors go off. They get too bright and flatten out, one by one, before slowly draining away. Then everything freezes, completely clear and smooth. Dead glass.\u201d He sees the fear on my face. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know who made it up. It isn\u2019t real.\u201d\nI\u2019m walking Out through the forest when I realize my brother is gone.\nWhere did he finally freeze? Sitting in his easy chair? At the dinner table with Ann and the kids, glass family? Alone on the toilet?\nI sing a song to keep myself moving.\nInsa winsa A B C\nSee Beast Do at the top of the tree\nA is for Apple\nB is for Bell\nC is for Crash when Beast Do fell\nBeast do this, Beast do that\nFly me away hid in his hat\nHow many secrets in that hat?\n1, 2, 3, 4\u2026\nNot a song. More like a chant I made up when I was little, just after I left the farm and came to the city. Not for years have I thought about it and now it pops into my head as clear as a B is for bell.\nI want to let the pain in and collapse. I have to keep walking.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhere are all the people, all the strangers from Out? I\u2019ve been walking through this forest for days and days. I have hunger cramps and period cramps and muscle cramps. There\u2019s a stream of water that may or may not be safe to drink, but it flows Out, so I keep following it. I have no choice, and there isn\u2019t even the tiniest residue of sugar left inside my lemonade bottle.\nThere is so much space. Why don\u2019t people live here?\nMy food is gone.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMaybe my brain is eating up all of its fat stores.\nI\u2019ve definitely seen that maple before, with its bark scored by some old injury. And those rocks nestled in the vee of its Morningside roots. Orange moss that reminds me of bees buzzing. It\u2019s not just the tree, either. It\u2019s the tree\u2019s context. The leaves on the ground and the smells and the exact amount of sky that can be seen up through the branches.\nWhat is this?\nI walk and walk. Although I\u2019m on flat ground, I suddenly feel like I\u2019m walking downhill, into something. Going deep.\nDeep, but not deep enough.\nThis place is like a memory. I breathe hard. I want to stop, but walk faster. It\u2019s exactly like the forest near the farm where I used to live.\nNot deep enough.\nI\u2019ve seen that branch before, hanging off that tree, some voice in my head calling it a widowmaker. Not one like it, but that exact one. It stayed up there for years, and I was always coming to check on it, wondering when it would finally fall.\nThat voice. A man\u2019s voice.\nAll of this is familiar. That rock that looks like a sleeping dog on one side and a torn loaf of bread on the other.\nA man\u2019s voice. Please not today.\nAll familiar. The contours of the ground. The colors the colors the colors.\nI see him in my head now. I see his face. Papper\u2019s face. And I want to run.\nThis is just like thirty years ago. There\u2019s going to be an oak with a great big cleft a five-year-old could climb up into. A declivity underneath that fills with water after every rain and is almost never totally dry.\nInsa winsa A B C\nI used to test the water level with a stick. To see if it was deep enough to go fishing in.\nPlease not today not today.\nI would wear the rubber boots that were always sitting by the kitchen door and I would stir up dead leaves and clouds of dirt and I would imagine I could see fish in there. Little minnows darting in silvery packs.\nI turn a corner and there it is. The oak.\n\u201cDeep, but not quite deep enough.\u201d\nA chubby girl stands in front of the tree, poking the puddle with a stick. There is a dead leaf stuck in her hair. She likes the shape of oak leaves; she thinks they\u2019re elegant. When she looks up and sees me, she smiles. Her front teeth are gone, and her eyes are the same color as mine.\n\u201cHi.\u201d\nI remember that I\u2019m an outgoing kid when I\u2019m away from Papper. I try to hide from him as much as I can, which is why I find these games to play in the forest.\n\u201cHi,\u201d I say.\nWe are so close to the farm now that I can smell the horses. I know that one of them is a dark bay. And the other bites.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d she asks. \u201cI\u2019m Emmy.\u201d\nSo am I. Emily, not Emmy, but close enough. And maybe I was Emmy, sometimes, back then.\nI can\u2019t tell her that. I say the first name I think of, my last name.\n\u201cBee stew?!\u201d she shouts, mishearing it just as I once did. \u201cLike a stew made out of bees? That\u2019s a funny name. I never heard that one before.\u201d\nI\u2019m frightened. Thirsty and so hungry that I sway on my feet.\n\u201cWell, Emmy is a pretty name,\u201d I say, trying frantically to remember whether I am scared at this point or curious or what. What will make this girl help me? Without alerting her Papper, for surely she has one.\nEmmy rolls her eyes. Too old for compliments, right\u2014they make her feel itchy. She wiggles her shoulders as though twisting away from an unwanted touch.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a stranger, aren\u2019tcha?\u201d\nI nod, wanting desperately to sit down, but remembering that my towering bulk is impressing her.\n\u201cI come from In of here,\u201d I say. \u201cWalked through the forest, a long way.\u201d\nHer eyes widen. \u201cPapper says never go too far In. Or Out!\u201d\nI smile at her transparent delight at meeting someone who has broken one of Papper\u2019s rules.\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you do it?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cMy city got bleached. I had to run away fast.\u201d\nShe raises her chin and looks at me knowingly. \u201cBleaching isn\u2019t real. Why did you do it really?\u201d\nI take a step forward, looming over her, trying not to faint. And I remember the words as I\u2019m saying them: \u201cBleaching is real. It\u2019s as real as I am. Someday it will happen in the place you live. Do you understand?\u201d\nI feel twisted, weighed down on one side by Mrs. Lower\u2019s tapestry bag, wild and haunted. I can feel the moment when she starts to be scared.\nShe nods her head. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to talk to me that way,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m not your Papper.\u201d\nRelief blooms on her face.\n\u201cWhen the colors look too bright, that\u2019s when you have to go. Pay close attention to flowers. Always be ready.\u201d\nShe nods her head again, but less self-consciously. She\u2019s taken it in. I know.\n\u201cSo is that what you eat?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I blink at her.\n\u201cDo you take the stingers out before you put the bees in? How long do you cook it? I like stew better when it\u2019s cooked longer.\u201d\n\u201cI actually don\u2019t have any food right now at all,\u201d I say. \u201cI ate it on the way here.\u201d\n\u201cYou must be pretty hungry.\u201d\nShe doesn\u2019t move, just keeps staring at me with big eyes. I really do have to sit down now, and I land with an awkward thump beside the puddle. I look mountainous.\n\u201cMaybe you can catch me a fish,\u201d I say, pointing.\n\u201cOh,\u201d she says, poking her stick in and pulling it out again to examine the waterline. \u201cIt\u2019s not deep enough for fish yet.\u201d\nShe does get me some bread and cheese later, sneaking it from the back of the pantry and bringing it to me when the sun goes down and Papper is out of the way. She even fills my bottle with water from the pump. My whole body aches with different kinds of hurt. I sit and eat, trying not to go too fast. I should save some of it, but soon it\u2019s all gone.\nA few minutes later, I have to try hard to keep from throwing up.\nI sleep until dawn, get up to pee and bury my last tampon, and then sleep until the lazy dead of noon.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSmall insects drone around me. Nothing else moves; the horses cluster in the shade of a livestock shelter near the edge of the forest. I sneak around behind it and peer off at the farmhouse.\nWhen I remember what is happening inside, I do throw up.\nI am a coward.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cHe always goes down easier on the days it happens,\u201d I say.\nShe looks at me with suspicion and alarm. How did I find out? Will I tell anyone else? But when my words sink in, she realizes that I know what she\u2019s dealing with. That I\u2019ve dealt with it, too.\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d She picks at the quilt that used to hang off the iron headboard of my bed.\n\u201cYou know,\u201d I say, \u201cI can help you leave. There\u2019s a place in the city for you. It\u2019s way better than this place, trust me.\u201d\nShe rolls her eyes at me again and snorts, but her body is practically vibrating. I see how young and artless I am, and it makes me hate him more. She\u2019s going to run away with me, a stranger, a refugee from In. That\u2019s how desperate she is.\nI never realized that before.\nShe rocks back and forth, hugging her legs and singing, \u201cEenie weenie A B C, see Bee Stew sitting under the tree\u2026\u201d\nIt is toneless.\nWhen the song dies out, I tell her, \u201cIt can be the last today, today.\u201d\nShe goes still. Her voice is small.\n\u201cYeah. Please.\u201d\nThe next thing I remember, thirty years ago, is Beast Do carrying me on a broad back over a stream. We made the city that evening.\nBut now I have to decide how to start. I have to decide about Papper.\nHe\u2019s asleep, drunk. I\u2019m a coward.\n\u201cStay here,\u201d I whisper. I\u2019m still not sure.\nInside the farmhouse, I pause. There are differences. A cross-stitched pillow that says sweet home instead of sweet friends, a lamp I don\u2019t remember. I\u2019m beginning to see the pattern of the world I live in. Maybe it\u2019s not always perfectly replicated, like a slowly mutating strand of DNA. Still, each grain in the wood floor is the same. The dark, worn spot on the couch where he always sits. That burned edge on the blue potholder hanging from the hook above the woodstove\u2014I touch the scar on my wrist.\nI wonder what the first Emily was like. The first Papper, the first farm.\nThere is a knife he uses to carve birds. I take it out of the kitchen drawer and mount the steps by route of fewest creaks. But he\u2019s dead drunk in Emmy\u2019s room, lying on his stomach on her bed and snoring.\nHe\u2019s smaller than I remember. Is this all he was?\nI can\u2019t tell if his face looks different, or if it\u2019s just slack from sleeping, mushed against the coverlet.\nI do it. This blood can stay unburied, as ugly depthless as it wants to be.\nI leave with as much food as I can stuff into my bag .\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cHey kiddo,\u201d I say, careful not to touch her. \u201cTime to go.\u201d\nI hold out her heavy coat, even though it\u2019s still high summer. She doesn\u2019t ask how I found it, packed away in the trunk in the extra bedroom.\nI got cold in my city that first winter.\n\u201cCome on.\u201d\nWe sing the song about Bee Stew together as we walk. Through Papper\u2019s fields, then another farm, Out toward the city. We stop for the night and sleep under an oak, our favorite shape. I don\u2019t know if anyone will come looking for us. But I do know they won\u2019t find us.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI take her into her city, to a certain street. Knock on a certain door. The woman I think of as my mother answers. Farrah Bistou is warm, seemingly boundless and not at all frail, not yet. My resolve almost crumbles when I see her. I imagine myself wrapped in a nictitating membrane, separate from this her. I must keep quiet, keep my eyes lowered.\nShe will die in five years, but it will be enough time. Her son will inherit the shop and he will let Emmy run it when she is old enough. She will have her own place and live quietly until the day the carnations oversaturate.\nAfter things are arranged, I am at a loss. Do I stay here? Watch Emmy grow up? Watch my mother get sick again? How long before they recognize me?\nFive years might not be enough, with me crowding them.\nI buy clothes with the money Farrah presses into my hand. Brand-new old-fashioned shoes. There are opportunities to Morning, the shopkeeper tells me, for those who dare.\nI walk toward the rising sun, a bold line in the pattern of a fading world.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue30\/3lbe30_story6.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"The carnations are oversaturated.

And so I leave these notes, saying hey, I\u2019m at the lake, you remember the one. It\u2019s never a question, I know you remember. We argued over the color of the water.\nIndigo, you said, but indigo was never so bright. Midnight, you offered, and I had seen midnight, my hips rocking against yours as a sliver of moonlight moved over the end of the bed and the water was nothing so sweet. Turquoise, that\u2019s what it was. All those upper layers, turquoise.\nI\u2019m up at Lindy\u2019s cabin. I\u2019ll be there until the first, working on the end of this book. At long last, the end of this book. And maybe too, the end of you. At long last.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBy that time, I hadn\u2019t spoken to Jess in two years, but ghosts lingered, surprising me in books, closets, and refrigerators. Still capable of finding some part of Jess in a head of goddamn broccoli, and still recalling our last conversation, I headed to Hanging Lake at Lindy\u2019s behest. It wasn\u2019t a big lake, hers the only cabin there because her family had owned the land since the war\u2014no one else wanted it, claimed it was rotting with ghosts.\nWrite your fucking last chapter, she said, and so I, delirious with friendly direction, packed my bags and went, having never been to Lindy\u2019s cabin alone. Jess had been with me the last time, a giddy group of nine we\u2019d been, lured into the pools for a dip under the stars. Meteors that night; we counted twenty-six before we climbed prune-skinned and limp from the turquoise.\nRumor was, the war had carved Hanging Lake and its pools; bombs had pockmarked the ground into a violent map of the moon, explosions exposing geothermal hot springs beneath, allowing them to overflow their steamy caverns. Filled to overflowing, the springs exploded into a lake and fifty years later, the lake spilled her banks, birthing more pools beneath the lake\u2019s waterfall edge. A terrace of turquoise hidden in the spruce woods.\nRumor also had it the lake was where war prisoners had been hung from the skeletal trees along the circling shore, bodies allowed to sway until time rotted the ropes and sent them plunging over the falls. Muscle, bone, and marrow dissolved, deepened the turquoise, and created the darker depths, where the blue went black. The shore was hunched with boulders, speckled with moss and lichen, green and pink in the day, black by night.\nThe chapter wasn\u2019t finished by the time I stepped into the lake, but I couldn\u2019t resist its pull. Lindy\u2019s cabin had always been a place of refuge and this time alone was no different. I had avoided the book\u2019s end for so long\u2014if I held to the book, I also held to Jess\u2014and after a wallow in the turquoise, I resolved to finish. Stepping naked into the water was like stepping into a mineral bath, warm and spiked with salt, calcium, radium. We\u2019d never emerged glowing, though sometimes in the summer nights, the pools themselves looked lit, clusters of bioluminescent creatures luring insects to their doom.\nThings that should not live in the lake lived in the lake. Slate pencil urchins, abalone, baby hawksbill turtles. Cuban land snails with broad blue banding through their shells crept along the warm rocks where limpets had bored, their shells as pocked with craters as the land around them. As though they too had been caught in the war, shaken by the blast, adhered and unable to move on. One year, we pried mussels from the stones, shells cracked by the time we drew them out, trailing juice down our fingers and arms.\nThe water, cascading from my body when I emerged, was almost oily, my toes pricking in the droplets falling from belly, breasts, shaken hands. The night was warm and had warmed my towel, my sandals, and all around me the woods rose still, no wind, no birds, only the dusty arc of the Milky Way high above. The world tipped when I looked that high. Jess used to joke that the lake could intoxicate a person; that its warmth and salt would change a body and make it unsuitable for the land.\nThe ground was spongy underfoot. I\u2019d left footprints in the muddy ground on the way to the lake, but as I turned for the cabin, could not find them. The path between the trees had never been paved nor had it ever been lit. It was not a lengthy trail\u2014the cabin not more than twenty-five steps from the lake, but I couldn\u2019t find the way. I had dropped my towel at its end but where my towel pooled, there was no path.\nThrough the tree branches, I could see lights, pinpricks from the lanterns that hung beside the cabin\u2019s back door. When the air moved, the lanterns seemed to twinkle. The spruce branches, blue and soft as if they were new, allowed me to pass where the path should have been. I walked easily, wrapped in my towel, mud squelching underfoot, but then lost the light of the lanterns. The branches did not obscure it\u2014the light was simply gone.\nElectricity came and went in the mountains, but there was no storm to blow the lines down. I stood in the dark and listened and could hear only the low breath of the wind through the spruce. Ahead, the forest was dark. Above, I glimpsed puzzle-ragged pieces of sky between the branches, a sky gone cloudy. I could not smell rain, only the sharp scent of the trees and the minerals of the lake still clinging to my gooseflesh skin.\nPushing through the branches and their gentle needles, I counted my steps, expecting a break in the trees, the fireroad running fat between two sections of forest, but at twenty-five steps, the trees continued. I turned back, thinking I had come out on the wrong shore, so traced my way back to the water. Only I couldn\u2019t find the lake, either.\nTwenty-five steps back the way I\u2019d come only brought me more softly growing spruce. I looked for the glowing pools and saw a glimmer to my right; I followed through boughs that lost their soft needles; here, the trees turned hard and brown, but farther, regained their softness once more. At the line of fresh growth, I found the lake, and exhaled a breath that turned into another laugh. I closed my hand around the nearest branch, fingers sticky with sap, arms riddled with scrapes. I thought of the wine I\u2019d left at the cabin, and how I wouldn\u2019t need it before sleep because the lake had already made me stupid drunk.\nReoriented, I made my way around the fragile shore, mindful of where I stepped. I walked behind the upper pools, the lake to my left-hand side all the while. Every shoreline was travertine, thin straws and fingers of the mineral slowly creeping outward from lake and pools, into the woods. Every now and then, my steps crunched as I found an unseen line of travertine, and I edged further from the pools. On the far curve of the lake, I could not see the path to the cabin, but saw the lanterns glowing against the side of the building. I stepped back into the trees, hurrying now, because I\u2019d begun to lose the warmth I\u2019d soaked up in the lake. I wanted nothing more than to wipe the mud from my sandals and get warm again.\nThe lantern light was inconsistent. Halfway through the trees, the light flickered and was gone. I did not stop, but pressed on in the direction they had lain, even counting my steps did not bring me to the fireroad before the cabin. There was no cabin, nor lanterns, nor fireroad.\nThe air whispered fresh around me and I looked up, finding more puzzled sky above. Still clouded, I had no hope of figuring out my direction\u2014the moon was never visible amid the trees. Stars would have been a good second, but I didn\u2019t even have those, so turned around and returned to the lake, counting forty steps. Forty. That would have meant I was beyond the cabin and that was impossible.\nI moved to one of the boulders and placed my hand on it, comforted by the warm stone under my shaking fingers. I told myself it was only the cold that made me tremble, but it was something else. I\u2019d never been up here alone, but I\u2019d also never been lost in the woods. I reasoned that I could find the lake and so in turn I could find the cabin, even if I ended up waiting until sunrise. And sunrise would come, because the boulder held the warmth of the day that had only just been.\nThat warmth soaked into my thighs when I leaned against the rock. The warmth was real and calming and I exhaled. A writer\u2019s mind was prone to imagination, and for me this was especially true after working on a long project. I would have thought my mind drained and empty after the creation of a novel, but in the cabin the cursor still blinked, and my mind continued to conjure lights in the trees. Among them, deeper shadows.\nI watched the distant lights in the distant trees and did not move, though I wanted very much to chase the illumination. If they were not the lanterns, what were they? The lights moved, sometimes like a wave of water, other times like a galloping horse. They were gentle and then they were sudden, and then they were rushing through the trees toward me. A thousand incorporeal lights advancing on me, a star flung down from the heavens, disintegrating in the sky, falling into my lap. It came so close, I cried out and twisted away, dropping to my knees in the mud.\nWhen I picked myself up, quivering as if an incurable illness had taken up residence inside me, I could not convince myself to believe in the lights because the woods were dark, the sky clouded. In the trees, I saw what should have been the distant shine of the lanterns on the back porch. I stared at the lights as they widened, and I felt myself falling into them, but I was no closer. I had not moved from the boulder on the shore. I wiped the mud from my skin before wading back into the lake, to wash myself in the mineral-saturated waters.\nI slept in the water. Cradled against lakeshore, my head pillowed on limestone, I found myself wrapped in a sheath of seaweed. The lake was not the sea, I told myself, but the seaweed was there even so. My fingers wrinkled but my shoulder, where it jutted from the lake, remained dry. The night air against my dry skin was neither warm nor cold, but when I sat up and water sheeted from me, my skin shivered. Ahead in the trees, the lanterns burned. Their light made perfect rectangles down the whitewashed side of the cabin, framing the door that led to the kitchen.\nI knew the kitchen\u2019s floor was tiled, blue and white checkerboard. A ratty rug that had sopped up years of lake water stretched before the door and I wished myself upon it. Wished myself dripping dry in kitchen warmth.\nBut wishes didn\u2019t make anything so. I rested in the net of seaweed, observing the unchanged sky. The clouds at last betrayed their movements, churning against one another. I held my breath until my lungs ached, until the gray billows broke and a seam of stars became visible. Every star looked like a seed nestled in the black dirt of the world, and I took comfort in their overdue appearance, summoning the energy to push the seaweed from my body and climb from the warm lake. The seaweed claimed my sandals, carried them away.\nWater did not drip from my body so much as it slid, making a puddle beneath me as I gauged the direction of the cabin lights. They were where they should have been, through the trees, and I forgot my towel in my haste to reach them. I was halfway there, twelve and a half steps, when they vanished again.\nThe breeze was replaced with a breath so foul, it made me double over and retch. It was lake water I vomited, though had no memory of swallowing any. The heaving brought me down. Pressed hands and knees in flooded mud, I heard the movement in the trees beyond me. Jess, my heart whispered, but it was not Jess.\nIt wasn\u2019t footsteps, but the sound of a large animal padding toward me through the low branches, through the fallen needles and mud. I couldn\u2019t put a name to the animal; my trembling mind could latch only to the sound\u2014the snuffle through wide black nostrils, the question in its breath as it paused and gulped air into its fanged mouth. I could not move. It was big, so big it blocked the lights from the cabin and threw its shadow against the branches that still separated us. I felt lost in its shade, swallowed by the darkness until it shouldered past the final branch between us, and screamed.\nWhen it lowered its head and growled, the sudden cabin lights blinded me. I shrieked and forced myself into motion, fleeing the way I had come, to the shelter and solace of the lake, to the turquoise waters that took me in. I plunged down, bubbles cascading past cheeks and through hair, and swam as if the beast was at my heels. I swam to the far side of the lake before I turned to look. A cougar\u2014yes, that was the word\u2014yowling from the far edge, but not pursuing or entering the water. We stared at each other in confusion and terror both, saliva dripping from its panting mouth. It sank onto its haunches, looking at me as though it didn\u2019t know what to make of me. Its broad nose snuffled at the lake, but the cougar did not drink. It dipped a paw in and regarded me.\nWith nothing between us except the lake, the animal was pure threat. Its fur was matted with mud and needles, its teeth curving from its mouth, yellowed and hooked in ways they should not be. Those teeth weren\u2019t right, nor were its clouded eyes. The cougar was old, old and as out of sorts as I was.\nMy breath lodged in my throat and the cougar lumbered back into the trees. Once it had gone, I waited as long as I could before paddling back across the lake, to press my fingers into the marks it had left in the mud. Real then, not some terror from my exhausted mind. My hand fit into its paw print with room to spare.\nMy eyes never left the trees, not for the longest time. I crouched and shook and eventually realized I was sobbing. When my legs could no longer hold me, I collapsed onto the shore, tears splattering my hands as they sank into the mud. I knew I needed to watch the branches and shadows, listen for the cougar, but I could do neither. I could only lay there, until I saw the sky.\nIt was brighter now, though not precisely morning; no sunlight slanted across the lake to pierce the cabin\u2019s windows. I remembered Jess fumbling to close the curtains on one such bright morning, a short \u201cfuck\u201d bitten in two at the brightness that poured over our bed. But there was no such light now, even as the lantern lights through the trees became less apparent. The day was brightening, and yet was not bright.\nI convinced myself to move, to push back into the trees and see what I could find. I was certain of dawn\u2019s approach, that the clouds obscuring the sky were lighter than only moments before. I roamed but found no cabin and no fireroad; only trees and more trees beyond. The lanterns seemed to follow me, tease me, always where I thought the cabin should be but never was.\nMy heart was furious, beating its way into my throat. My naked body bore the signs of my countless paths through the spruce branches; my arms and legs bore marks as if I had been whipped with hard-needled boughs, red and scraped. I plucked my towel from the mud, but it was a stained mess, perhaps pawed by the cougar. I held the sloppy bundle against my chest and walked another circuit of the lake and its pools, needles and rocks biting into my feet.\nThe lake was always there, a great turquoise eye watching. All around it, things that should have been were not. And other things that should not have been, were present for me to see: boulders the color of glaciers, gleaming and blue in the half-light; trees so stair-stepped with bracket fungi like figures in ruffled party gowns; a stack of small wet stones taller than me. The precision of the column created in me the thought to knock it over, to disrupt the order, but when I touched the rounded curve of one, I realized it was a not a stone, it was a shell\u2014a turtle shell. The stack rose so high into the trees it looked like an escape attempt.\nIt occurred to me then, to follow them. To climb the tree beside them until I reached the top and look out over the forest and find the path to freedom. Lindy\u2019s cabin roof would be visible; there was a door to the roof, and we had often spread a blanket on the cedar shingles to watch the stars. When I put my foot to the lowest branch and reached for the next, a shriek filled the trees. I told myself it was only the old cougar, but it sounded much worse. Much larger. I gripped the branch and pulled myself up, only to have the world around me shake.\nThe ground shook violently beneath my feet, soil and needles blurring, until it cracked and made visible angry red fires below. The vibrations hurt my hand and foot, and I had to step off and back away from tree and turtles, expecting the tall stack of reptiles to topple. Everything moved but for that column of shells into the sky.\nThe rumbling ground became as a stampede, the breath of a thousand angry fleeing animals filled the air. My heart kicked back into my throat and I fled, as panicked as any of the unseen herd. Blind with tears I staggered through branches and mud until again I found the lake and floundered into its shallows. The ground did not cease moving nor the trees stop shaking, not until I swam from the edge into the water that grew violet-black in its depths. Not until I could lost touch with the bottom. Then, the world calmed, the animals quieted, and the clouds thinned.\nI slept in the water, floating. I lifted my head and contemplated the distant lakeshore, where no cougar or other beast lurked. The stretch of land was empty, but for the spruce and the beckoning lights beyond. I stretched a hand through the water, reaching for the cabin, though I knew by now it was futile. I could find no way of getting back to where I\u2019d been. The water gleamed around my hand, sunlight piercing the cloud cover for the first time to reveal the water\u2019s iridescent sheen in my palm. I thought nothing of it, even when I climbed from the lake as clumsy as a newborn. The water sheeted from me, but my skin remained iridescent, turquoise in the hollow of my elbows. I told myself it always had been, that in summer I always looked powdered with gold dust, especially after Jess smoothed on my after-sun lotion. Down my back, knuckling into the base of my spine, painting me gold and dust. That in the winter I was silver, and in the spring I was green. That I turned with the seasons as I was turning now, moving in circles when I could not find the cabin.\nEvery direction I sought contained miseries. The ground heaved, the trees obscured paths, the cougar herded me back to the lake, over and over. Time and again it was the lake that became my sanctuary, the world only turned calm when I sank myself into its turquoise water. North, south, east, and west had failed me, but the ragged circle of Hanging Lake took me in. There, I floated, without weight or bones, as the world beyond grew distant, as the sunlight put itself away again, and night\u2014or what passed for night\u2014filled the woods. My feet were cut and walking became clumsy, so clumsy. I told myself to rest, but everywhere I sat upon the land, my body ached.\nThe lake pulled me down. In my exhaustion, I stopped paddling in lazy circles and the lake closed over my head. It was like being swallowed, a warm tongue around me. At first I did not thrash, so pleasing was the notion of being consumed, of being taken away. I could not reach the cabin, but in that instant it did not matter. I floated down, and down again, until my outstretched arms were entirely engulfed, until my hands vanished beneath the surface. Only then did the self-preserving part of my mind rebel. My lungs began to burn with emptiness; in the dark water I could not see or breathe or even move. Warmth enclosed my feet and at its grip, I thrashed. I kicked up, and up again, until I could see vague shapes beyond the lake\u2019s surface, until I burst through spluttering and paddled to the fragile shore.\nThe world didn\u2019t want me. The old cougar stared at me from bloodshot eyes. Its fanged maw opened, huffing with discontent as I screamed in return. I tried to run, but that hot mouth closed around my arm. The tongue was a serpent, the teeth a vise I would never escape whole. Did their sharp points reach my bones? With my free hand, I punched the cougar\u2019s nose until the air was flecked with our blood. It released my arm with an anguished howl, but pursued me into the shallows, swiping with its massive paws. Blood turned the water purple.\nThe cougar churned after me. It was old, but a good swimmer yet, and it tackled me into the turquoise. The world went indigo then black and I could not see or swim with the huge cat\u2019s weight upon me. Its paws were bigger than anything I had known, folding me against its hot heaving belly, the way it might a wriggling salmon.\nWe sank into the dark that turned cold and warm again, out of the turquoise and into the black where I\u2019d never found the bottom. There was no light this deep, there was nothing. Only down and further down. Only the cougar, its warmth and weight eclipsing every thing in the world\u2026\n\u2026until we broke through a crackling lattice of coral. Then the cougar released me.\nI kicked franticly, in the direction I hoped was up, still through the black, toward the distant surface that I had to believe still existed. When I burst through, my lungs aching in my chest, sucking a desperate breath through my mouth, my sinuses roared with water. Blood streamed into the ripples around me. My hands were full of fur and I could not unfist my fingers.\nI paddled backwards as the cougar broke the surface. I think it was the cougar, though it looked like a thing turned inside out. All that should have been tucked away was revealed to the wide clouded sky. Ivory bone snapped through exposed raw meat. Arcs of blood colored the sky and spread in the water, and it was scarlet eating the turquoise when the cougar was hauled beneath the bloody froth and down into an unseen throat.\nThen the surface of the lake grew calm and still, until nothing moved, least of all me, hanging in the ruin of the moment.\nI forced my body into motion, toward the shore. The shore, away from the deepest point of the lake, where the cougar had been swallowed. I clawed the water, and finally pulled myself into the travertine, not caring that I dragged myself over its coarseness, into the mud and the spruce. I never got far.\nNo matter how far I wandered, the woods contracted and I was never more than five steps from the muddy shore. I saw the lake no matter how far I ventured into the trees. Branches that had once known only sunlight now skimmed the lake\u2019s surface, closing tight and tighter still, their needled arms herded me.\nIn the end, the lake was all there was. My body was battered, scratched, and bruised as I crouched in the mud, dripping blood and watching the gentle turquoise water. I did not know how long I had been here. I tried to remember when I had last lain in a bed and could not. When had I last eaten? Time had neglected this place, the spruce branches creaking in the wind, as if they still held the weight of nooses and their prisoners. I wrapped my arms around my knees and shook, feeling the world close in. My breath hitched, the air felt like poison.\nThe shore faded and the world dwindled to a warm pool of water with beckoning depths. If I could not go out into the trees, there was only one place left. The water had taken the cougar. But it had also offered me rest, ill-fitting seaweed, and warm ripples. And so I crept into the shallows and paddled to the deepest part, trying to summon the strength to dive, to swim down to where the turquoise ceased and the black began. I imagined I could breathe the liquid, that I was not suffocating, that I could never drown. That beyond the violet-black of the lake\u2019s depths, the turquoise returned. That within the heart of the lake there existed another world, one that was eager to take me in.\nIt did not. I dived and my lungs shrieked their panic. I pushed deeper and my body refused, jerking away as a spider crab tiptoed across a strand of coral, vanishing into the black. Small glowing blobs danced across my vision, fireflies I thought, or jellies, but my body took this to be an imminent loss of consciousness. I kicked up and up, breaking through the surface with a cry.\nThe world had constricted again, spruce branches scraping my head. There was no longer any shore, no longer any lanterns, no longer any sky, nothing that would allow me rest, and so I paddled, knowing in my heart the only way. Freedom was down. Only down, but I could not make myself go there. I paddled in circles, sobbing until the world blurred, until my arms and legs ceased their motions. My body refused the lake, even as the water said it alone would enfold me.\nClinging to a spruce branch overhead, I stared into the depths, watching the turquoise spiral down into the black. It was so gradual, so natural, I told myself I could do the very same thing. I let go the branch and failed twice more, before I went a third time, exhaling the air until my protesting body could only quiet and descend like a stone. Until I breathed the water as easily as I had air. The lake grew dark and cool by gentle degrees, and once all was black, I could feel myriad creatures swimming past me, then swimming with me.\nThings that should not live in the lake lived in the lake. There were jellies against my arms like the sleeves of a billowing gown; there were viperfish and frilled sharks, catfish and salamanders. There were soldiers, relics of a forgotten war with ragged ropes around their bone necks. Farther down, the turquoise I loved so well brightened the lake floor the way the cabin lanterns brightened the woods. I swam for the swelling light, iridescent arms cutting through the water\u2019s salted warmth as I let go the surface.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIndigo, midnight, but always ever turquoise even when the sky beyond the spruce clouded. Anyhow.\nI\u2019m at the lake.

If I had known what your father was I would never have allowed him on board.\u201d\nMy father lay spread-eagled on the deck, as he had done for most of the trip, his head propped up against the pilot\u2019s cabin, gazing out to sea. Over the past twenty-four hours his body had swollen to such an extent that his clothes needed cutting free to ensure the continued circulation of his blood. Kobayashi and I had found a length of unused sail cloth in the hold, and had stretched it over his body to preserve his dignity. The material was swept away now, unneeded, and his transmuted flesh was exposed once more. The crew of the Izumi clustered about, pointing and muttering suspiciously. I could understand their fears. Chitinous growths extended along the length of my father\u2019s spine, whilst his skin was charcoal black, like something that had been left too long in a fire. I asked if he was in pain, but he could make no sensible reply.\nCaptain Akira ordered the crew into motion, and they dragged my father toward the boat\u2019s stern. The sailors sweated and cursed as they clutched at his now trunk-like limbs, struggling to get a grip. I wondered if they had already stopped thinking of him as a human being. I moved to confront them, a stream of insults flying from my lips, but Kobayashi wrapped his arms around me, forcing me to turn and face him.\n\u201cEmiko, sister. Please!\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do. There are too many of them. Don\u2019t give them an excuse to throw us all overboard.\u201d\nHis binding secure, the crew used the haulage crane at the rear of the Izumi to lift my father\u2019s body off the deck, then swing it free of the boat. I stood alongside Kobayashi, my hands balled into impotent fists, and watched as the Pacific Ocean slowly closed over my father\u2019s head.\nWe were one hundred miles from Japan.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nA small bell above the door announced our arrival. My father eventually emerged from a room at the rear of the shop. He looked confused, like someone who has just been woken from a deep sleep. A tattered shawl was draped about his shoulders, the sort of thing an old lady might wear. Days of stubble lined his face, whilst his hair sprouted in graying tufts. His unclipped toenails had gouged holes in his woolen socks. They poked through the material like dragon\u2019s claws.\n\u201cYes? Can I help you?\u201d His accent was a curious mixture of Japanese and American, the result of decades of exile.\n\u201cHaruo Xiang?\u201d\nHe shook his head. \u201cHaruo? Never heard of him\u201d\nI had never seen my father before, not in the flesh, but I had grown up surrounded by his images. He had become a figure of legend for me, the aftershocks from his appearance in my mother's life continuing to be felt down the years. Haruo Xiang, the once good-looking movie star, had been replaced by the old man before me. His skin had creased with age, marring his features like scar tissue, but I could still see the handsome man he\u2019d been. I\u2019d brought old photographs of Haruo with me, one of them in a tattered movie magazine. I reached into my shoulder bag, determined to confront him with the truth.\nAs soon as he saw the magazine my father turned and fled to the back room. He tried slamming the door shut behind him, but Kobayashi was faster, jamming it open with his foot. \u201cPlease, Haruo-san. This is your daughter, Emiko. She needs to speak to you. You understand?\u201d\nMy father glanced briefly at me, then down to the floor. The truth of our shared heritage must have shown in my face. Haruo recognized himself within me, and could no longer meet my gaze.\n\u201cGo away. Please.\u201d His voice was weak. \u201cI don\u2019t want you. I don\u2019t love you. I don\u2019t need you.\u201d It wasn\u2019t what I\u2019d travelled six thousand miles to hear. But I had found him. My father existed. Not a myth, not a legend \u2014 but real. I began to cry.\n\u201cHaruo. Father. It is you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nHe reached for the magazine. It was folded open to a page showing the photograph of a smiling young man. My father studied his own likeness for a while, then turned the page. He sighed. The next picture was also of my father, though without the caption no one would know. The photo showed a film set, on which a man dressed in a rubber monster suit \u2014 part-lizard, part-dinosaur \u2014 clambered over a miniature Tokyo cityscape. He handed the magazine back to me. \u201cDaughter. You think you know me, but you don\u2019t. All you know is this,\u201d he pointed at the creature, \u201cthe shell outside. You don\u2019t know the real me at all.\u201d\nI stepped forward and took his hand in mine. For the first time ever, I was touching my father. His gaze finally met my own, a mixture of fear and hope in his eyes.\n\u201cSo tell me,\u201d I said.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMy father hunkered down in his solitary chair, an open bottle of wine cradled in his lap. I sat at his feet, feeling like an old-fashioned geisha girl. The room was cluttered with stacks of paperbacks; overstocks from the shop below. Kobayashi moved from pile to pile, feigning interest in their titles. My father lapsed into silence, turning the wine bottle round in his hand.\n\u201cYou met my mother on set?\u201d I said.\n\u201cWhere else?\u201d My father smiled. \u201cYour mother was one of the studio secretaries. Nothing glamorous. But still, I thought she was out of my league. I was only getting small roles here and there. Stunt work, sometimes. She used to encourage me. Told me I should believe in myself. She said I could move onto bigger things if I tried. Ha!\u201d He barked out an unconvincing laugh, and lifted the wine bottle to his lips.\n\u201cSo what went wrong?\u201d\n\u201cThat damn creature.\u201d He flicked a hand at the magazine that lay open on the floor. \u201cWho would have thought it would become so popular, eh? One week I was a nobody, the next people were queuing for my autograph. Meet the man behind the mask. I was very popular. With women, I mean. Fame changed me, and not for the better. How is Oroko, anyway?\u201d\n\u201cMy mother is dying,\u201d I said. I didn\u2019t know how to soften the blow. \u201cLeukaemia. She\u2019s the reason I\u2019m here. She wants you to come home.\u201d\nMy father was silent for a moment, studying the wine bottle as though for some important clue. \u201cHome?\u201d he said finally. \u201cI lost my home years ago. That damn creature.\u201d He lifted the bottle to his lips, then spat. A spray of wine arced across the magazine, across my leg. I sensed Kobayashi come up behind me, placing his hands on my shoulders. \u201cDo you know what Oroko said to me the last time we met?\u201d My father bared his lips in a humorless smile. The wine had stained his teeth a dark red. \u201cShe said I\u2019d turned into a monster.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWe planned a flight to Hong Kong, then a series of bus rides up to Shanghai, where we hoped to find a boat to smuggle my father into Japan. All the way on the flight to Hong Kong my father was clearly agitated, gripping the seat rests until his knuckles turned white. He seemed relieved when we landed, as though amazed that the plane had completed the flight.\nAt the beginning of the journey my father was taciturn, but as we headed north through China, his mood slowly improved. He regaled me with tales of the old days, of the glamour of the movie business. He was even recognized on one occasion, by a young boy who couldn\u2019t have been born when his films were made. He asked for an autograph, and to my surprise my father agreed. The boy had nothing to sign, so my father made me take out the movie magazine I had brought from home, scrawled his name across it, and handed it to the youth.\nIn Shanghai, we passed our time walking the streets of city, marveling at the sights and sounds. For my father, who had spent the last three decades living in the West, the oriental style of the old town was a reminder of home, yet to me everything seemed alien and strange. Women bustled past us, their faces hidden beneath painted silk umbrellas. Traders shouted as they pulled carts laden with jade statues and mobile phones. We browsed the open-air markets, breathing in the smells of cooking meat. Small headless creatures turned on roasting spits, their flayed flesh glistening with fat. What creatures these had been in life, it was no longer possible to say.\nPassing one building my father suddenly stopped short. It was a tiny cinema, and he was staring at a poster in the lobby. One of his old films had been restored and re-released. He seemed overjoyed, and insisted we go in to watch. \u201cYou know, daughter, I\u2019m not so old,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I can still make it back home?\u201d\nHis good mood didn\u2019t last. Halfway through the movie he stood up and walked out. I asked him why.\n\u201cThat creature wasn\u2019t me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve done something to the film. Replaced me with some kind of computer effect. That\u2019s not how I remember things at all.\u201d\nI had seen the film many times. The monster in the movie looked the same to me as it always had. But my father was looking different, day by day. I had grown used to seeing him hunched over, as if afraid to meet the gaze of the world. Now he walked tall, with a new confidence. With every mile that brought us closer to Japan, my father seemed to grow in stature.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nOn the way back I overheard him arguing with Kobayashi.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t approve of me,\u201d said my father. \u201cYou don\u2019t agree with what Emiko is doing. Dredging me up.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d replied Kobayashi. \u201cYou\u2019ve caused a lot of pain. Not just Emiko and her mother. I\u2019ve heard about the other women, the other children. The lives you\u2019ve ruined. Personally I think this world would be a better place if everyone forgot you existed.\u201d\n\u201cSo why are you helping her? What is she to you, anyway?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m her brother.\u201d Kobayashi raised his voice. \u201cEmiko is part of my family now. A family that came after you. I don\u2019t run away from my responsibilities.\u201d\nI made as much noise as possible as I walked out onto the deck, and an uneasy silence settled over the pair. I reached into the hold-all and removed one of the jars of ointment.\n\u201cMy back please, Emiko,\u201d said my father. As I leaned toward him I caught the scent of his breath, rancid and hot. Kobayashi helped me remove his shirt. Whatever was affecting him, it was not eczema. A series of ridged calluses were growing along his spine, breaking through the surface of his skin like brittle fins.\n\u201cI know what you are.\u201d\nI turned at the voice.\nCaptain Akira was standing over us, his face wrinkled in disgust. \u201cKaiju! Monster!\u201d\nMy father began to laugh.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDoctor Amomoto met us at reception. A brief bow, but no smile. He told me to prepare myself for the worst. The specialists had done all they could, but the radiation therapy was no longer working. \u201cNot long now,\u201d he said.\nKobayashi waited in the corridor whilst I entered my mother\u2019s room. She looked tiny, like a doll, half-hidden by bedclothes. Oxygen tubes snaked up her nose, whilst another tube in her arm led to a medicine drip by her side. Wires from her chest attached her to a heart-rate monitor, which emitted a regular electronic beat. It sounded like a clock, counting down.\n\u201cHello, mother.\u201d I touched her brow. Her eyelids fluttered and opened.\n\u201cEmiko.\u201d Her voice was dry, raspy. \u201cYou\u2019re back. I was just dreaming about you. You and Kobayashi.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice, mama.\u201d I tried to smile, but it felt false. Tears stung the corners of my eyes.\n\u201cEmiko. Pretty little Emiko,\u201d she said, reaching to stroke my face. \u201cNot like me. Not now. Look at what they\u2019ve done to me, child.\u201d The radiation therapy had left my mother bald, with blotchy, rose-colored patches marring her once flawless skin. She smiled sadly. \u201cI must look like a monster to you.\u201d\nI buried my face in her shoulder, trying to hide my tears. She still smelled like my mother. She still felt like her.\n\u201cYour father,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t all his fault you know. I bear the responsibility too, for letting him become what he did. Did you find him?\u201d\nI pulled myself back into a sitting position. \u201cYes, mama. We found him.\u201d\n\u201cAnd is he coming? Did you bring him with you?\u201d\n\u201cYes, mama.\u201d The lie came easily. \u201cHe\u2019s coming soon. In fact, he\u2019s on his way here right now.\u201d\nMy mother smiled and closed her eyes, her hands gently clasping mine. We stayed that way for a while, listening to the wind as it stirred the trees outside. Somewhere far out to sea a storm was building. I could hear the approach of distant thunder, its roar splitting the air like an animal\u2019s cry.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI was staying with Kobayashi in one of the courtesy rooms at the hospice. The night was hot, and I had left our window open to admit a cooling breeze. During the night I was woken by the sound of my mother\u2019s voice floating in from outside \u2014 thin, reedy, but unmistakably hers. The tune was familiar, something from my distant remembered childhood, a mournful lament. I called out to Kobayashi, asking if he heard it too, but my brother remained soundly asleep.\nI got to my feet, made my way to the window, and opened the blind. My mother\u2019s room was visible directly opposite ours, and beyond it a rocky promontory overlooked Tokyo Bay. Mother stood framed in the open doorway, trailing tubes and wires behind her like a marionette that had learned to walk unaided. The full moon bathed her thin white cotton nightdress in a ghostly glow. She stared out at the bay, her mouth full of song.\nHer voice was accompanied by a beat, faint but regular, and growing louder. A pulse, rising up through the ground, like a giant heart buried deep within the earth. Like the heavy tread of approaching footsteps. I felt the impacts shudder up through the hospice floor, up through my legs, and I clutched the window sill for support.\nSomething massive was rising from the water, its head blotting out the lambent moon, its skin a deep charcoal black.\nI closed my eyes, and waited for the dream to pass.\n###\n\u201cHasten back to us.

The chimney blew a kiss toward the sky, where low-flying cumulus clouds patrolled from horizon to horizon.\nI shook my head ashamedly.\nInside, it smelled old; it smelled of spiders spinning gossamer in the corners, of rainwater leaking through the ceiling, of specters prodding lampshades and lifting toupees from the heads of unsuspecting guests.\n\u201cI hope you like pancakes,\u201d Mr. Bagley said, laboring up the hardwood stairs behind his wife. \u201cCause Ruth makes the best buttermilk flapjacks in the state of Minnesota.\u201d\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t in the brochure,\u201d I said.\n\u201cLegal purposes.\u201d He chuckled, losing a day of his life with every hoarse guffaw.\nI ran my fingers across the balusters, wincing as each memory fingerprint coursed through my mind. Atop the stairs, the puerile urge to slide down the banister on my ever-fattening posterior almost overcame me.\nWe continued down the hall, motes of dust aflight in the wan shafts of sun.\n\u201cHere we are,\u201d Mrs. Bagley said, flipping on the light switch. \u201cThe Berkshire Suite.\u201d\nThey shuffled off without another word, pale and ghostly in their drooping clothes and penny loafers. But I knew they\u2019d be terse. They had owned the estate since 1969.\nI collapsed into bed, fatigued by the commute from Roseville. It was a quarter past three. I could savor a few hours\u2019 respite before getting to work.\nI descended into a pit of skyward-groping arms and writhing bodies, an orgiastic mob of Rubenesque women, their flesh undulating, and chiseled men, their overwrought libidos fuming from every naked pore. The effluvium of their breath and their perspiring forms enveloped me with the clammy tongue of a hound. On the outskirts of this pulsing throng, casting their stark shadows on the walls, were the watchers. I lurked among them, my tool of passion blazing in my grasp.\nI swam up through the ether of sleep, yawning and laboring with my ten-ton eyelids.\nGood afternoon, sweetheart.\nWith the graze of my fingertips, blue phosphorescent filigree burned across the surface of the mantel, painting vivid pictures that crept through my veins and tickled my skin to gooseflesh. All dormant images, untouchable by Mrs. Bagley\u2019s Pledge.\nAnother day at the office, eh Bob? The man had sable hair down to the small of his back, while mine was cropped short. A stainless barbell jutted from his eyebrow.\nI continued to comb the room, Isabelle\u2019s suite. So far there was nothing of her, not a strand of astral DNA.\nStop wasting time. Didn\u2019t you already get a confession? Let\u2019s go home and get laid. When was the last time it wasn\u2019t just ghosts?\n\u201cThey\u2019re not ghosts,\u201d I slipped.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between ghosts and memories?\n\u201cWhat happened to Mom, then?\u201d\nGuilt.\n\u201cBut I saw her too.\u201d\nYou couldn\u2019t accept the fact that Mom was a loony.\n\u201cShut up,\u201d I said. \u201cJust shut the fuck up.\u201d\nA ripple spread through the chenille drapes, and they billowed out before the window, ocean combers bearing the distended corpses of sailors and shipwrecked buccaneers. I froze, watching without breathing as the drapes twisted upward in an inverted funnel. Everything was muted, the raucous laughter from another suite merely a soft dirge.\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t like you.\u201d It was Mrs. Bagley, the footless phantom. Standing in the doorway, hands on her hips. With her tumorous nose and her mound of gray hair. She vanished, and the drapes settled.\nFingers tapping playfully on the windowsill, I stared into the forest, and my lips cracked open in a smile, though it could\u2019ve as easily been a frown.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cWhen did you start believing in ghosts?\u201d Eva Nectar and her husband were sharing the sofa beside the fireplace.\n\u201cI was a kid, maybe eight or nine, staying over at a friend\u2019s house,\u201d I said. \u201cI was up in the middle of the night, going to the bathroom. Swear to God, I had a bladder the size of a mustard seed. So I do my business, and I\u2019m heading back to bed when I hear these footsteps coming up behind me. At first I\u2019m thinking that I woke up one of his parents, and I turn around, with my apology ready.\n\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t his parents. And here\u2019s some guy I\u2019d never seen before stumbling down the hallway after me. He\u2019s got this bullet wound in his gut. And he\u2019s got his hand there, trying to hold in the blood. But it\u2019s just flowing between his fingers. Deep, black blood. Gallons of it, seemed like.\n\u201cI make it to my friend\u2019s room. I\u2019m so freaked out I climb into bed with him. Ten minutes later I creep out into the hallway. But there\u2019s no one there. No blood. Nothing.\u201d\n\u201cSome guy who lived there before, you think?\u201d Eva said. \u201cShot himself or something?\u201d\n\u201cProbably,\u201d I said, gazing at my lap as I spoke to her. Eva was an alluring woman: lush black hair, all in braids, maple complexion, supple thighs, half of them veiled in a pleated skirt. Whenever I glanced in her direction, I kept my eyes fixed on her husband, my quavering fingers tapping the armrest.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a ghost on your shoulder,\u201d Mrs. Bagley said from her seat in a Queen Anne wing chair, her gimlet eyes boring holes through me. \u201cSome reason you\u2019re out here, tearing down people\u2019s lives.\u201d\nMy grandma, I thought. Grandma Jo-Ann, who had stalked Mom through two apartments and a townhouse. I remembered her tacking notes on the corkboard in the foyer and reading romance novels while Mom and I slept. She\u2019d followed her daughter into a mental institution. But despite what anyone may\u2019ve said, my mom wasn\u2019t psycho-ward material. I\u2019d seen Grandma, too.\n\u201cWhere is she supposed to go?\u201d Mrs. Bagley said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a matter of speculation.\u201d\n\u201cJust like if someone tore down your house.\u201d\n\u201cNow,\u201d I said, trying to keep my emotions in check, \u201cthe theory, which is backed by years of parapsychological research, is that when you take away the ghost\u2019s haunt, you take away the ghost itself.\u201d After Congress had passed the Poltergeist Residence Demolition Act, scores of old warehouses, funeral homes, hospices, and buildings on nearly every campus in the nation had succumbed to the wrecking ball.\n\u201cSo you\u2019re trying to kill her.\u201d\n\u201cBy all means, ma\u2019am, Isabelle Stewart is already dead.\u201d\n\u201cThen, why tear this place down? Why insult her memory? Did you know she still stayed here, even after she was forced to sell the B&B? Why don\u2019t you go spit on her grave while you\u2019re here?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to get hostile with me, ma\u2019am,\u201d I said, yearning to exchange the ma\u2019am with bitch. \u201cI\u2019m just here to make an assessment.\u201d\n\u201cThen lie. Just say there\u2019s nothing here.\u201d She paused, donning her grandmotherly visage. \u201cYou could come back any time with the warmest of welcomes.\u201d\n\u201cNot only are you asking me to wave my ethics, you\u2019re asking me to break the law. If you continue, you might find yourself facing some bribery charges.\u201d For a moment, I felt elevated, empowered.\nThen I was barely able to check my compulsion to apologize.\nA moth batted against the window, and we all turned, tacit, to peer into the obsidian depths of the night. The fire was pacifying \u2013 its light flooding over the hearth and creeping across the Oriental rugs and finally dancing on our pallid flesh.\n\u201cSorry, but I\u2019m a little lost,\u201d Mr. Nectar said. \u201cWhat exactly is it that you do, Mister uh\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCarson,\u201d I said. \u201cLane Carson. I\u2019m employed to a demolition company out of the Cities called Recker Brothers. I assess properties for poltergeist activity.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you qualify for a job like that?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a clairvoyant, third-generation. My grandma, my mom, and now me.\u201d\n\u201cSo you can see the future?\u201d\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s called precognition. I touch things and see the past.\u201d\n\u201cDoes the generation matter?\u201d Eva said. \u201cYou said you were third-generation.\u201d\n\u201cIt takes two generations for the clairvoyance to fully develop. Then, after the third generation, it either diminishes or disappears altogether.\u201d\n\u201cIf you are what you say you are,\u201d Mrs. Bagley said, \u201cthen tell me why Isabelle is dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cBecause dead company is bad company.\u201d\nA cackle arose from the recesses of my mind. Is that our new slogan?\n\u201cDo you know why Isabelle always stayed in the same room? The Berkshire suite has a direct view of the tree house her husband Todd built for their son Kenny. It was where he spent most of his free time. And do you know what\u2019s beneath that tree house?\u201d\n\u201cAre you going to tell me?\u201d\n\u201cThe unmarked burials of Todd and Kenny Stewart.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard rumors of Isabelle\u2019s family. Does this have a point?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe tearing this place down wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing for her. It could be liberating.\u201d\n\u201cDid you even think about how this would affect us? Harry and I. Do you even care?\u201d she said, and the tears \u2014 those she\u2019d been withholding since I\u2019d appeared at their front door and the media-dubbed Haunted House law became a reality, her reality, and a decree that reverberated through her head, a eulogy for the house already perished \u2014 those tears welled up in her eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re old. We can\u2019t just pick up our lives and move.\u201d\nMr. Bagley shuffled over to her, his shoulders stooped in an eternal slouch, and he was soothing her with his brittle palsied hands. He buried his face in her hair and gave her a kiss with his parched lips, now more cream-colored than pink.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta understand \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cNo. I understand,\u201d Mrs. Bagley said. \u201cI understand how you can go home and forget about us. People don\u2019t care anymore.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. I really do care. What I said earlier \u2014 I\u2019m sorry about that. I was being \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, son,\u201d Mr. Bagley said. \u201cHoney, why don\u2019t you go put on your nightclothes and get situated? I\u2019ll stay here and talk to Mr. Carson for a few more minutes.\u201d\nWith Harry gripping her palm, Mrs. Bagley stood, her eyes moist and scarlet.\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll call it a night,\u201d Eva\u2019s husband announced.\nBut my eyes, they were trained on Eva, as she brushed aside her braids, as she offered her comely half-grin.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see you bright and early,\u201d Mr. Bagley said to his wife.\nAnd mere minutes after Mrs. Bagley\u2019s tearful bout, the parlor was vacant, and sitting on opposite ends of the same overstuffed sofa, there was only Mr. Bagley and myself. Almost.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something I want to show you.\u201d He hovered over a Philco record player, his back bent at an excruciating angle. The needle crackled over aged vinyl, and Elvis sang over the retorts of the fire and the mournful sighs of the wind. Harry thumbed the volume knob. \u201cCan\u2019t play it too loud, this late. But she loves Elvis.\u201d\nI felt my foot start to life, tap out a few beats.\nSuddenly, something passed through me, a warm consciousness, welcomingly violating my personal boundaries. And the air before us flourished, heaving with a more potent and blissful life than I\u2019d ever encountered. Though she never unveiled her astral body, I felt her jitterbugging about her private dance floor, mouthing the words to the song that made her heart stutter. And if the song would\u2019ve played forever, she would\u2019ve danced with it.\nI glanced at Mr. Bagley, thumbing his suspenders and grinning. Tears crept across my cheeks. I was shivering.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nOutside, the wind\u2019s intensity had increased tenfold. I heard the leaves, aflutter at the tips of immense branches. Suddenly, I felt my privacy betrayed.\nThis is your conscience speaking.\n\u201cAnything but.\u201d\nYou caught me.\nDelving farther into the rolling duffel, my hands found the toiletries case, where I kept the pills.\nWhat are you doing?\nAnd if I had the capacity to stop them, I don\u2019t know that I would\u2019ve. \u201cGetting rid of you.\u201d\nNo response from him, him with his back turned, him who couldn\u2019t watch.\nThen, I was outside under the colossal moonlit columns, naked save a pair of plaid boxers. The wind was a straight razor, shaving off my skin layer by layer. I shifted between feet, each numb from the frigid cement steps. I turned back to the house.\nA woman materialized in the entranceway. She was almost ancient, but still showed the vestiges of beauty. Though I\u2019d never seen her, I recognized Isabelle.\n\u201cIt\u2019s late. Will you two be staying?\u201d\nI glanced to my left, and there he was, standing shoulder to shoulder with me, wearing my face without the seams or crow\u2019s feet. Maybe if I stopped loathing him, I\u2019d begin to like his presence, or love it. I might even become him.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cYes, I think we will.\u201d\n\u2022\n\u00a9 2005 Brenden Haukos, all rights reserved","source":null,"source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/wIclR71nL3hadUtoPNVePdsL5dw.json"}

A breathless alto called, \u201cWait up.\u201d Chorister Urushiol skidded and fell into a walk beside us, shifting a stick, no, an umbrella, under ver arm. Ve hitched trousers up over green rubber boots and shook vis poncho into place. The outfit suited the kid \u2014 everything suited dreadlocks, wide brow, startled eyes, high cheekbones, Greek nose, and bee-stung lips.\nI turned toward ver and said, \u201cThe cook\u2019s aunt claims she saw the God in the sanitary canal.\u201d\nWe\u2019d been struggling to find a new God since spring, when our incarnation floated to the surface of the temple pool, dead.\n\u201cI\u2019m coming too,\u201d said Urushiol, tossing ver dreadlocks.\nWe followed an old railway embankment north through thickets of staghorn sumac and heaven tree. My heart sank when the swiftian\u2019s purple chimneys hove into view above the greenery. I\u2019d not been up this way since I\u2019d lost Tori. But my duty was to the God. I searched the sky for auguries \u2014 signs of things to come. Swirls of swiftians, shot through by crows. Crows meant opportunity. Swiftians \u2014 not so much.\nOur shelter that night was a ruined bridge. Crows crawked us to sleep.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nJude said, \u201cYou\u2019re the expert.\u201d\n\u201cNo I\u2019m not,\u201d I said.\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Jude. \u201cPure accidents, all those catfish.\u201d\n\u201cI never noodled for a God,\u201d I said.\nThe kid interrupted, \u201cNoodling?\u201d\n\u201cIt means sticking your fingers and toes into holes and using them for bait,\u201d said Jude. \u201cLike noodles.\u201d\nWe stripped near bare in the warm sun, piled T-shirts, flip-flops, hoodies and poncho on the bank, rolled up pants. Jude pulled his bushy hair into a top-knot.\n\u201cBoots?\u201d asked Urushiol.\n\u201cThe canal\u2019s too deep,\u201d I said, \u201cbesides, we need your toes for bait.\u201d\nSunlight spangled through branches. The water was tepid as bathwater. I headed upstream. Jude and Urushiol followed, ready to yank me up if anything pulled me down.\nI groped, stirring up mud, and released the sweet smell of decay.\n\u201cLet me,\u201d said Urushiol.\nI stepped back. The kid reached a hand into a hole in the bank, yelped, and withdrew bloody fingers. We ducked as a feathery body the size of a raccoon flew, gape-jawed and needle-teethed, straight toward our faces, yowling like a cat. A swiftian. It left a purple trail on the water. We gagged at the smell and scrambled clear.\n\u201cWas that\u2026?\u201d said Jude.\n\u201cIt was,\u201d I said, snapping my mouth shut and speeding up. I failed to pull past Jude\u2019s voice saying, \u201cDidn\u2019t the swiftians abduct Tori?\u201d\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t \u2018abducted,\u2019\u201d I said over my shoulder. \u201cThat abduction talk was nonsense. She went to ask them a question. For all I know, they\u2019re still answering.\u201d\n\u201cI heard you went looking.\u201d\nI clamped my lips shut and swept my eyes ahead.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWe kept on. My wandering mind suddenly translated what the swiftian had yowled on its way out of the hole. \u201cSoo-thing-ly I say give it you.\u201d Or, \u201cYou asked for it.\u201d Typical. But at least I had understood it. Eventually. I\u2019d not lost the knack entirely.\nJude hollered and went under. Urushiol went after him, and I followed ver. Together, we pulled Jude up, clinging to a leathery tail. We all three heaved, bringing up the rear of a spiky shell. Clawed hind feet flailed. We lifted. Head and forefeet broke water. Massive jaws swung, sideswiping Urushiol. The kid slipped. Jude tripped over the kid and lost his hold. The mossy shell slid out of my grip. I dived, but the God was gone.\nUrushiol was bleeding again. We collected our clothes and retreated under the bridge. I could see swiftian silhouettes flying in, out, and around the chimneys. Thankfully the dusk hid their wrinkly, naked heads, made worse by bulging eyes and undershot jaws jammed with needle teeth.\nThe last time I\u2019d met those eyes I\u2019d yowled in terrible swiftian, \u201cI re-quest, has asking\/pykeon woman been seen here just?\u201d They\u2019d swarmed me before I got it all out, dozens and dozens of feathery bodies jostling for a chance to vomit all over me.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nJude caught me staring at the towers. He raised his eyebrows.\nI said, \u201cThe Abbot wants the God. He said nothing about swiftians.\u201d\n\u201cSo true,\u201d said Jude. \u201cHe did not prohibit us.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll swarm us.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who packed saleratus.\u201d\n\u201cJust another item for the begging bag. Jude, I tried this before.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019re three of us this time.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole flock of them.\u201d\n\u201cSaleratus?\u201d said Urushiol. \u201cThat powder the cook uses to raise biscuits?\u201d\n\u201cIt neutralizes the effect of swiftian body fluids,\u201d said Jude. \u201cShould we happen to encounter any.\u201d He raised his eyebrows at me again. \u201cYou can dicker with them.\u201d\n\u201cPykeon patter, that\u2019s all. I tried, and they swarmed. And don\u2019t forget the moon-cattle hanging around the towers. Those pretty crescent horns. We\u2019ll be lucky to bring back the God.\u201d\n\u201cAt the God\u2019s grace we will catch the God,\u201d said Jude. \u201cPerhaps we need to do a deed before the God consents.\u201d\nUrushiol shined great grey eyes on me. Jude and Urushiol gleamed like folks about to do good; I glowered like a person about to be spat on, shat on, and come out worse than he came in. Like a person in love.\n\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d I said, \u201cyou\u2019ll see, and you\u2019ll be sorry. Urushiol, you\u2019re the one with the voice, can you do this?\u201d\nI pursed my lips, whistled, hummed, and made noises like teakettles and yowling cats.\nUrushiol mimicked me perfectly. \u201cDoes it mean anything?\u201d ve asked.\n\u201cTrill for trill? \u2018Rigid-ly I tell you, straighten up, fly right \u2019\u2014 Swiftians always make a play on trills when they trill.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Urushiol.\n\u201cWhat those trills mean,\u201d I continued, \u201cIs \u2018Behave.\u2019\u2014\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nUrushiol pulled on ver boots, extracted ver umbrella and climbed the embankment. I followed to take the auguries: rain slackening, no swiftians, and true swallows flying south. Change.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cFirst we\u2019ll be gored, then spit-bombed,\u201d I complained. \u201cOur duty is to get the Chelonian to the Temple.\u201d\nJude put a finger in his ear, cleaning it out. \u201cDid you say \u2018duty\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cYou got a problem with that?\u201d I said.\n\u201cJust didn\u2019t sound like you,\u201d Jude said. He reared his head and sniffed. He was the elder, maybe 36 to my 26 and Urushiol\u2019s 16. Though these days calendars were shaky; people miscounted \u2014 especially orphans like us.\nJude\u2019s face was open, calm, and alert, like a big predator\u2019s. But instead of bloodlust, a deep, dangerous kindness moved him. Now it cornered me. I didn\u2019t know which I feared worse, the swiftian swarms or finding out for sure what they had done to Tori.\nThe rain petered out. Urushiol furled ver umbrella and danced ahead. Moon-cattle raised their heads and stared, making their decisions. The kid got within a couple meters of their speckled hides before they collected themselves, rose up, and ambled on. Their ambling was like Jude\u2019s calm \u2026 they were liable to turn, and there was no outrunning them.\nHuman decline had freed them to breed their way back to the bull-god, all muscle, sex, and death. There was a sect, not ours, which fought them, slit open their hearts with long knives and stole their heartbones for the courage inside.\nBut the moon-cattle had cuds to chew and we had swiftians to dicker with. Also liable to turn. It\u2019s a planet full of biters, gorers, spitters, and shitters. And birdies, twittering in the trees. And gods. And Urushiol, dancing.\n\u201cWatch out for cowpies,\u201d I said.\nThe swiftians might spit-bomb me on sight. Jude couldn\u2019t hit the high notes. The next time Urushiol danced by I snagged ver. Time for more language lessons.\nUrushiol got this funny look on ver face half-way through. Ve whistled the swiftian for he, she, and it, then kept going.\n\u201cMeans the same thing,\u201d the kid said. \u201cWhy different tone?\u201d\n\u201cPronouns, they\u2019re pronouns,\u201d I said, releasing my inner pedagogue. \u201cSwiftian pronouns cover six sexes and castes.\u201d\n\u201cSwiftian for someone like me?\u201d said Urushiol.\nI whistled a short, shrill, rising note.\n\u201cHey,\u201d said Urushiol, whistling it back. \u201cLots like me?\u201d\n\u201cThey all are,\u201d Jude put in. \u201cAt a certain age. Then they change. But for a while they are, yes, they are vers.\u201d\n\u201cCacophonic!\u201d said Urushiol. Ve pirouetted and outstretched ver arms, almost clipping a swiftian coming in for a landing. Jude and I scattered. The kid stood ver ground, yowling, \u201cGreatly, I greet,\u201d bowing deep, spreading ver arms wide and lowering ver head. I gripped the pouch of saleratus, just in case.\nThe swiftian shrilled, \u201cWhatee waaant,\u201d swinging its marble eyes side to side and swiveling its ears.\nUrushiol whistled, almost getting it right, \u201cI repeat, we search for kykeon woman, we search for kykeon woman,\u201d and made a lovely curtsey while holding the furled umbrella.\nThe sentry swirled off. In minutes, a full he-Mada+ appeared, twice the sentry\u2019s size. Its squashed head came up to my chest. It flashed yellow shoulder patches and needle teeth at me, ignoring the kid. I bowed, keeping my head down and my hand on the saleratus.\nIt spoke plain English. Squeaky, yes, but not patter. \u201cPykeon man, what give for pykeon woman?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you ask?\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou,\u201d said the he-Mada+, \u201cdistill pykeon.\u201d\n\u201cLet me see pykeon woman.\u201d\n\u201cDistill pykeon. Then see.\u201d\nHe flashed yellow wing patches and flew.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cJude, she\u2019s gone,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d he said.\nUrushiol\u2019s eyes swiveled between us.\n\u201cIf she was still there, the swiftians wouldn\u2019t need me to distill anything.\u201d I swatted a fly with a narrow-gauge waist and a turquoise blue abdomen. A swiftian pest: I remembered one clinging to a strand of Tori\u2019s curly hair, caught, glimmering on the still. The last sign I\u2019d seen of her.\n\u201cAre they aliens?\u201d said Urushiol.\nI snorted, \u201cNo more than you or me. Just more freaks from the great poisoning. We\u2019re all mutants now.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nShe was so sure of herself, not listening when I said that the swiftian flock was indifferent at best, hostile in general, and lethal at worst. If I thought any more about it, I\u2019d get riled. I kicked at a concrete walk. It ended at a hole. All paths led to holes these days. From where I stood, I could see the dark hollow of Tori\u2019s last known whereabouts, at the base of a swiftian chimney.\nThe cattle bawled, belched, stirred up bugs and left manure behind. Swiftians swooped, ate the bugs, dropped dung; the grass grew rank and lush; the cattle browsed and grew strong. If swiftians felt threatened, they stampeded the cattle, and the herds flattened everything in their path. It worked out nicely for both of them. I swatted.\nAs night came on, we rolled out blankets. Urushiol opened ver umbrella and stuck it in the bushes over ver head.\nI couldn\u2019t sleep. I waited until Jude\u2019s snorts and Urushiol\u2019s even breathing assured me that they slept. Swiftians would be in their roosts inside their chimneys, the cattle hunkered down in brushy places. I crept out into the prairie. Swiftian towers clawed at the starless sky. I set my toes down first, rolling the soles of my feet slowly to the rough earth, breathing softly through my nose.\nA rustle dogged me. No prairie lion or wolf would make such a racket. I knew who it was before I felt the breath on my neck.\n\u201cWait up,\u201d whispered Urushiol.\n\u201cGo back,\u201d I hissed. Urushiol ignored me. When we\u2019d almost made it to the towers, Urushiol rustled one last time and tripped, catching verself with ver umbrella. Nothing stirred.\nI tripped on a root and sprawled into Urushiol. Ve dropped ver umbrella. It clattered. In seconds, a yowl went up and we were surrounded by a scrum of swiftians.\nUrushiol regained ver umbrella, stood, bowed and whistled, ver skin a pale shimmer in the dark. The swiftians closed in, shoving us into a hollow at the base of a tower. Dander from their feathers got up my nose; I couldn\u2019t protest \u2014 I couldn\u2019t stop sneezing \u2014 as the swiftians spit rubbery cords and sealed us in. One whiff, and I knew exactly where we were. There\u2019s nothing like the bitter sassafras smell of pykeon.\n\u201cRest up,\u201d I said to Urushiol, removing my hoodie and lying down on it. \u201cMorning\u2019s liable to get complicated.\u201d After bouncing off spit cords a few times, ve settled.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThrough gaps in the translucent spit cords I could make out swiftians shooting from the chimneys and swooping in squadrons \u2014 until a he-Mada+ blocked my view. Maybe the same one: I wasn\u2019t any good at telling them apart. Not that it mattered much with swiftians.\n\u201cDistill,\u201d it whistled. \u201cHappily we say we are overjoyed that you make pykeon.\u201d\nI whistled back, \u201cUnhappily I say I cannot without pykeon woman.\u201d\n\u201cSolitarily I mention, she did without pykeon man.\u201d\n\u201cSingularly I say, I cannot do without her.\u201d\nThe he-Mada+ took off. Sentries dawdled outside, ornate ears flicking. The sight of Tori\u2019s precise handwriting on labels and lists made my heart clench. Where was she?\nUrushiol leaned on the barrier, practicing swiftian whistles while I searched through spit strips, casks of water, vats of fermenting spit, and production notes. Tori had kept meticulous notes. They ended abruptly a few weeks back.\nSeven times a he-Mada+ came back to demand I distill, and seven times I refused to do anything without Tori.\nUrushiol called, \u201cThey say she\u2019s coming.\u201d\nThe he-Mada+, or a he-Mada+, returned. \u201cYou distill, you see pykeon woman,\u201d it said.\nNo harm in starting a fire under the pot-still. Maybe Jude would see or smell the smoke.\nNo harm in cooking fermented spit and turning it to low wine. A little low wine would do me good.\nA reflection flickered on the side of the pot-still. Sentries yowled.\nTori tumbled into the cave hissing, \u201cStop cooking!\u201d\nThe sentries drooled the spit barrier tight as I caught her in my arms.\nLast I\u2019d held her, she\u2019d been bouncy with muscle and sparkly with plans. Now I held a starveling, skin stained with bruises, latticed by scrapes, hair matted, and eyes sunken \u2014 but nervy as ever. She murmured, \u201cDon\u2019t do it. They\u2019ll never let you go if they find out you can\u2026\u201d\nI felt like I had a heartbone and it had risen and was sticking in my gullet.\n\u201cI was trying to get home \u2026 but when I stopped making pykeon they threw me into a pit. Who\u2019s she?\u201d she asked, letting go, staring at the kid.\n\u201cUrushiol.\u201d\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\u201cVe followed me here,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWhat, like a puppy?\u201d\n\u201cVe\u2019s a chorister at the Chelonian Temple: you remember the Temple. Ve came along with me and Brother Jude.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re messing with the Chelonians?\u201d\n\u201cA little,\u201d I admitted.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a brother, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019ve taken the hoodie\u2026\u201d Tori sighed and shook her head. She nodded toward the still. \u201cDid you get as far as low wine?\u201d\nI fetched her some. \u201cNot bad,\u201d she said, sipping. \u201cYou haven\u2019t forgot how.\u201d She offered the beaker to me. I drank and the sweetness loosened my throat.\n\u201cThe Chelonians \u2014 they\u2019re not forever, necessarily,\u201d I said. \u201cI just needed to pull myself together.\u201d\n\u201cYou hid in the Temple?\u201d\n\u201cYou left.\u201d\n\u201cI said I was coming back.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI tried. Did you even look?\u201d\nWith every word we moved closer, circling like wolves or dancers.\n\u201cI tried. Before the Chelonian, I tried.\u201d\n\u201cHow did it go?\u201d\n\u201cBadly.\u201d\n\u201cVery bad?\u201d\n\u201cBad enough.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d\n\u201cAnd for you?\u201d\n\u201cAs you see. For a while, I thought \u2014 I thought I was going to solve everything for us.\u201d\nTori reached for my face. I enfolded her, rags and bones and all, and cried.\nUrushiol looked away.\nNo one I\u2019d lost had ever returned. Not father, mother, sister, brother, friend. I stroked her hair in disbelief.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBefore I could move, whistling sentries ripped into the cave, yanked out Urushiol, voided over the coals, and sealed the entrance. Ve was gone before I could shout ver name.\nI shouted it anyway.\nTori put a hand on my shoulder. \u201cTheir nests burn like pykeon.\u201d\n\u201cThey permitted the still\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI told them that since the fire was inside, there was no danger.\u201d\nI raised an eyebrow.\n\u201cWell, there isn\u2019t, if you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll they do to ver?\u201d\n\u201cNothing good. Ver?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I said. \u201cVer. You didn\u2019t notice?\u201d\n\u201cI should have seen it, ve\u2019s so beautiful \u2026 Hey, don\u2019t worry. They won\u2019t do anything until morning. And I had a lot of time to plan down in that pit\u2026\u201d Shadows moved on the spit cords. Swiftian ears swiveled. Tori stopped talking. She made strangling motions with her hands and jutted her chin toward the outlet piping.\nI widened my eyes. \u201cMight get even stuffier in here,\u201d I said. As sparkly with plans as ever\u2026\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI caught my breath. Low wine was spit liquefied by fermentation. But even if the wine dissolved the cords, the sentries remained.\nTori set about shifting kegs. \u201cA lot of time to plan,\u201d she said.\nI had done the dickering, but she\u2019d always run the still. Her skinny arms moved like pistons. So sure. The last time she\u2019d been so sure, I\u2019d ended up with the Chelonians and she\u2019d ended up in a pit.\nI joined her keg piling. We worked well together, we always had. But when Tori blocked the outlet pipe, my hand hesitated over the coal scuttle. She couldn\u2019t be sure.\nThrough the spit cords I could make out one swiftian sentry, naked head huddled into downy shoulders.\nI could think of no other way. I shook coals onto the fire. Flames licked the copper, turning it black and gold. I opened the draft and poured pykeon on the coals.\nTori grabbed Urushiol\u2019s umbrella. We crouched against the far wall, behind a pile of kegs, hands over our ears.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe morning light picked out split kegs and dimmed the licking flames. The wind reeked of pykeon. I lurched forward. In a lone oak, crows spun like whirligigs. Anything, anything could happen.\nLittle grass-fires stuttered: the disordered swiftians voided over them. Buzzards dropped from the sky on black wings, primaries extended like blind men\u2019s fingers. They pulled flesh off a dark mound with sharp beaks. Flies swarmed. I smelled blood. It reminded me of my mother and my newborn brother. Their wails catching and failing.\nWhen Tori told me she wanted kids, I\u2019d ranted \u2014 It was Breed propaganda, I said, or her female nature betraying her. It was a swiftian world now. Why be stupid, like a salmon, heading upstream. And she had retorted, \u201cA salmon dies whether or not it heads upstream.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s 100-year-old salmon swimming around down there\u2026\u201d\nThe world was awash in orphans. Organizations like the Chelonians and the Hard-shelled Hyper-Calvinists collected them. Me, Tori, Jude, Urushiol. No one lived long enough to raise their kids. And a lot of women died having them. Like my Mom.\nI told Tori, \u201cNo more orphans.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she agreed. When she left me, she\u2019d added, \u201cI\u2019m making sure our children will not be orphans.\u201d\nAnd now I\u2019d lost her again. I breathed deliberately. The pykeon fumes burned away. A voice called. A ringing, carrying, chorister\u2019s voice. Oh shit. Another orphan. No more orphans. I staggered toward it.\nSwiftians whistled. A vibration ran up my spine and turned to thunder. Dust blew in my face. My body understood before I did, and pulled me up a tree. A torrent of moon-cattle flowed beneath. The herd tossed a pale ball on their horns. Green rubber boots and hands protruded from it. It sang. Dreadlocks flew like a comet\u2019s tail. I blinked, but the ball persisted.\nOn the far side of the torrent a bearlike shape rose out of the dust. A hood fell off a bushy topknot of hair as Brother Jude stood and called to the ball, a piercing whistle that penetrated the thunder, and the ball screamed back \u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d bouncing itself across the cattle. Jude raised his big paws and caught it. He fell backward, and sank into the grass. The herd slowed, broke up, and turned to grazing as if nothing had happened.\nI blinked again. A long black shadow pointed straight at my tree. It led to a grimy foot, jutting knee and arm akimbo, slanted body and crooked grin. Tori\u2019s eyes followed the swiftians lurching across the sky. \u201cI think we\u2019ve cured them of wanting pykeon,\u201d she said. She looked worse than ever under Urushiol\u2019s scorched umbrella, and I had never seen anyone so beautiful.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhite flakes blew over a bush. A fluting voice said, \u201cHey, cacophonic! There\u2019s my umbrella!\u201d We pushed through the shrubs and ran up against the wall of Jude\u2019s back. Jude spun and let out a roar, lifting me off the ground in a hug. He looked up, but no swiftians came.\n\u201cThey probably mistook you for a bawling cow,\u201d I said from inside the hug.\n\u201cHa,\u201d said Jude, letting go. \u201cNo worse than those screeching swiftians, the night you and the kid took off. Jolted me right awake, the Chelonian be thanked.\u201d\n\u201cI was just having a look around. Then Urushiol followed me\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026I wasn\u2019t following you,\u201d said Urushiol. \u201cI was making sure nothing happened to you.\u201d Though ve stood in a heap of peelings, most of ver was still encased in spit.\n\u201cHi, Tori,\u201d ve waved.\nJude roared, \u201cYou got her!\u201d and hugged me again, harder. \u201cPraise the Chelonian!\u201d\n\u201cThe swiftians brought us together,\u201d said Tori. \u201cPraise the swiftians. But not too much.\u201d\n\u201cGive me a hand,\u201d Jude said, \u201cso we can get this stuff off Urushiol and go.\u201d\nTori and I sprinkled saleratus and peeled. Jude talked. \u201cI snuck up to the chimneys, hid out, watched Tori come, Urushiol go. I followed ver, thinking you two weren\u2019t going anywhere. The swiftians encased ver in a spit wad and glued ver to the side of a tower. By then it was near sunup, not a cloud, and then this roar, like a landslide, and clouds of dust. The tower shook, Urushiol fell, and then more thunder, the earth shook, and thank the Chelonian, when the kid fell, the herd was underneath; they tossed ver, ve bounced, and I was ready.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cOuch,\u201d said Urushiol. Ve grabbed for something underwater and was pulled under. Jude and I pulled ver up, and ve held the leathery tail of the God. We heaved the Chelonian up onto the bank, grinning like fools, except for Tori. She glowered.\n\u201cYou know, the swiftians didn\u2019t care either way about me,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just wanted pykeon. Like you don\u2019t care about this turtle. You just want a God. But I remember the Chelonian God bumping around that tiny pool. We got free. So thank the Chelonian.\u201d\nI looked for auguries. Sunset; crows to their roosts, and swiftians to their towers. The strongest augury was the look in Tori\u2019s eyes.\nThe canal water rippled, braiding and unbraiding, carrying little rafts of sticks and feathers, hair, charred wood, and flies.\nJude looked from Tori to me and back, and nodded, \u201cThe God has blessed us \u2014 how else to explain it? Let us, in turn, bless the God. If the God wants to accompany us, she will give us a sign.\u201d He lifted his hands from the front of the shell. I let go the rear, Urushiol released the tail.\nThe God froze.\nUrushiol held up ver umbrella and whistled.\nThe God raised its head and pushed off, sliding into the water. Jude said, \u201cThe God has blessed us, but clearly, we have more deeds to do.\u201d","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue27\/3lbe27_story1.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"Hope is the thing with feet.

Feels good to let go.\nLeaves are taking over the yard. There\u2019s poo to clean up if anyone cared to look, but we don\u2019t look. We\u2019re too busy streaming horror movies and eating pasta and cinnamon rolls all weekend. Donny must be sneaking Halloween candy, too, because the bag\u2019s going down. We can turn the lights off and go to bed at eight on Halloween for all I care. Might be nice to have a good snuggle.\nWe\u2019re so cocooned, it takes us a week to notice it\u2019s not just us, that there\u2019s something up in the neighborhood. One day I put towels over the bathroom mirror and take the hanging ones out, and just a few days later everyone\u2019s big mirrors are leaning against the trashcans.\nIt reminds me of when everybody got flatscreen TVs and dumped all the thick ones on the curb. Those blocky TVs were more than useless. They rubbed you the wrong way, like the mirrors do now.\nIt\u2019s just too dark in the house to see things right. That\u2019s what I tell Donny. When it\u2019s dark and you look in a mirror, things seem to crawl and shift. Or if you\u2019ve had a drink or three, you might think you look extra sexy\u2014or when you try to cut your own hair, all the motions are off. Mirrors are strange. They\u2019ve never been exactly right, and now they\u2019re a little more wrong, is all.\nAnd we don\u2019t need them. We feel how strong and tight our bodies are getting. We feel our nails and our hair growing thicker and stronger, the lines in our chests and hands smoothing out. The spots on Donny\u2019s arms are just a memory.\nMister and Gracie sprawl and snore at either end of the sectional. We make calzones, shortbread, big breakfasts for dinner. All winter we feel warm and full and good.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nOh, we still work and shop for groceries and pay the bills. Everybody keeps eating and pooping, that\u2019s for sure. Everything\u2019s easier than it should be, though. Work goes fast, me and my friends have a nice lunch every day, the appliances don\u2019t blow out, pay lasts the month. Nobody\u2019s got car trouble. We don\u2019t get any unexpected calls from our parents.\nDonny\u2019s moved on to other theories, but I think we just might be in heaven\u2014up until Donny catches his thumb on the truck door. The nail turns black and keeps hurting him. That wouldn\u2019t happen in heaven.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe dogs are kenneled up. They bark a while, but they settle when Donny uses his big voice, squeak under their breath for a bit to let you know they\u2019re still nervous.\nThey\u2019re stuck in these cages, but they still want to protect us. It\u2019s pitiful.\nIt takes hours. I beg the one gal to sit us on the back porch a while \u2019cause it\u2019s so nice out. There are people on the patio across the way, and we see the ones in suits rushing around their outbuildings. Some wear green suits, some pale pink. Donny presses the side of his leg against mine and rubs my knuckles.\nHe thinks we\u2019re going to die. It never occurred to me, but I see in his face he already went there. I don\u2019t know. When they\u2019re finished, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll just go\u2014I\u2019m not stupid\u2014but I don\u2019t know what\u2019ll happen.\nI say, \u201cI was thinking we ought to get chocolate chip mint and pink peppermint and put a scoop of each on top of a brownie and then make Cara\u2019s ganache recipe. I think it\u2019s dark chocolate and butter. Or whip cream?\u201d\n\u201cKeep going,\u201d says Donny, and I talk about topping it with toffee chips and salt and black walnuts.\n\u201cYour yard\u2019s real pretty,\u201d says the gal. She walks a little away, tips her helmet up and spits on the ground, and Donny and me squeeze each other\u2019s hands because that means it\u2019s not something that\u2019ll kill you. She wouldn\u2019t take her helmet off. The old guy to the north of us whispers over the fence, \u201cWhat do you know?\u201d But she\u2019s coming back, so we don\u2019t answer.\n\u201cI said real pretty,\u201d she says.\nThe grass is patchy but soft and bright. The crocus bed is up and some of the tulips. \u201cThanks,\u201d I say.\nShe rocks back on her heels and says, \u201cYeah, I really like what you\u2019ve done with all the dog shit.\u201d\nI get that rush to grab her by the scruff and drag her off my property, but I can\u2019t do that, and that\u2019s what finally makes me afraid. She\u2019s slouching back, smirking, looking from side to side. The chemicals pumping through my blood turn to poison, and I\u2019m cold all through.\nThe gal takes out a compact. She pushes her helmet back and she\u2019s gorgeous, so gorgeous she has a boy\u2019s haircut just to rub it in. She checks her mascara. \u201cGets hot in the suit,\u201d she says, and, \u201cHey, you want to use this? She gestures like she\u2019s going to throw the mirror to me and chuckles and goes inside.\nThey leave us outside for two minutes and know we won\u2019t run. There are too many of them.\nWhen they move us to the van, Donny has my hand. He\u2019s saying, \u201cWhere are our dogs?\u201d He lets go of me, pulling toward the house, but a man comes on one side of him and a bigger gal on the other. They put him in the back row of seats and I slide in beside him.\nThe dogs whimper from their kennels in the back. We poke our fingers through the bars and pet their noses. We see the vans sitting in driveways all the way out of town.\nThen we\u2019re on the highway for a good half hour, just complying our butts off.\nCompliance is key, they told us back at the start of this thing, so we love on the dogs and keep holding hands and answering their questions. Anyone can see I\u2019m complying a little better than Donny, who\u2019s starting to quake. He asks questions of his own and they don\u2019t answer.\nOut past Hammett, the gal in the shotgun seat says she\u2019s hungry, is there anywhere good to eat?\n\u201cWell,\u201d I say, and not ten minutes later she\u2019s coming out with sacks of chicken-bacon-ranch sandwiches and nests of garlic fries and small-size drinks for everybody. I taste something in my drink, but Donny doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s too nervous to eat, but he\u2019s grateful for the root beer and drinks it down. I sip on my diet cherry pop and eat a few bites of sandwich before I go out, but before that I feel his hand go slack in mine, and I\u2019m happy he won\u2019t be nervous anymore. My arm feels heavy where I\u2019m resting it on the kennel, and then I can\u2019t keep my eyes open. I concentrate on the motion of the van building speed for the freeway.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWe\u2019re spooning in a bed that\u2019s softer than we like. I\u2019m the little spoon.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got such a headache,\u201d I say.\nHe feels my eyes to make sure they\u2019re closed. \u201cIt\u2019s the stress,\u201d he says, and hugs me to him and then rubs my shoulders too hard. I hear the dogs breathing on the floor.\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d I say, and Donny whispers for a long time about the room and what he saw earlier. He says the room is plain and white, about twenty feet square.\n\u201cThe dogs?\u201d I say.\n\u201cThe dogs are fine\u2014don\u2019t they sound fine? Here, puppy,\u201d he says and makes a smoochy noise. Gracey jumps up to us. Now she\u2019s the little spoon. I sink my hand into her rough poodle coat.\nDonny says there\u2019s a table with padded chairs like in a motel room, and that\u2019s all the furniture. It\u2019s not entirely dark\u2014a blue nightlight hangs mid-ceiling.\nOh, and there are mirrors on three of the walls. Big mirrors like on TV, the kind that have people watching from back of them.\nWe move in and out of conversation, in and out of sleep. We talk for the first time about how all of this started, a crawling in the mirror, just when it was dim or dark. We saw things there that we didn\u2019t like seeing. That\u2019s why we covered up the medicine cabinet. Just that one at first, then the one in the hall. But it wasn\u2019t really that noticeable, was it? We didn\u2019t like mirrors, and we maybe felt a little bit better than normal, was all.\nI keep thinking the sun will come up, but after a while, Mister starts to squeak and then Gracey is pawing at me. Somebody makes a skunk fart. It\u2019s still dark, and Donny finally says there\u2019s no window, just another big mirror behind the bed.\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d calls some man through a speaker. \u201cOkay if we walk the dogs now?\u201d\n\u201cWhy are we here?\u201d yells Donny.\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to go outdoors too,\u201d I say.\n\u201cOkay to walk the dogs now?\u201d he says, and Donny must nod, because the dogs are running towards a sound off to the left, and then they\u2019re gone from the room.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a restroom behind the bed on your right. Feel for the door,\u201d the man says from the speaker. \u201cFeel free.\u201d\nAnd a gal comes on. \u201cYou ought to take a shower, too.\u201d I catch the first cackle of a bunch of people before she must turn the speaker off, and it\u2019s quiet again.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThere\u2019s plenty of water, but they aren\u2019t feeding us much, just vending machine sandwiches twice a day, once in a while a candy bar. They leave it on the table by the door when we sleep. They sent in bleach one time in a paper cup with a straw, another time gasoline. I screamed and beat on the walls when they first sent in things like that, but now I just flush it. I don\u2019t like it going into the water supply, but it\u2019s that or let it stink the place up.\nI thought they were doping the dogs, but Donny says no, the dogs are just depressed because we aren\u2019t doing anything. With no TV and no light and no good food or walkies, I\u2019ve pretty well soured on the cocooning myself.\nI want to move now. I get down and do some pushups and try to do some plank moves and Burpees and things like that. It\u2019s tough with no music to keep going. It starts to burn, and I\u2019ve got nothing but the burn to hold onto, but I keep at it, longer and longer.\nOne time I stand by the door and beg them to take the dogs away somewhere. My parents\u2019 place if they can, or just somewhere. Even a shelter. They\u2019re cuties; they\u2019ll do all right.\nDonny tells me no, stop it, the dogs are better off here. He pulls me back on the bed and shushes me with his hand. But there\u2019s nothing wrong with the dogs. Whatever\u2019s going to happen to us doesn\u2019t need to happen to them.\nWe\u2019re not stupid. We know we\u2019ve been infected by something\u2014some alien thing or some government thing. An experiment, an attack, it makes no difference now.\nThings like this happen. It just feels unfair to be the ones it\u2019s happening to.\nDonny wonders if it was in the food. Or a meteor that came down near town. Or it came on the little feet of mice.\nHe sleeps more than I do. He says he has no hope anymore, though he\u2019ll feel hopeful for me if I say he should, and I say of course he should.\nDonny has a good ten years on me, harder years too, and I\u2019ve always assumed I\u2019m headed toward a life without him. We don\u2019t have any kids, just the dogs.\n\u201cIt was noticeable, if we\u2019d\u2019ve cared to notice,\u201d he says.\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d I say.\n\u201cWe just wanted to stay happy as long as we could,\u201d he says.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAt first it\u2019s just a shifting, shimmering movement too small to notice. My face\u2014I know I\u2019m holding it still\u2014but it\u2019s moving slightly, crawling around the jaw. Then the mouth smiles and stretches tight, the motions just enough to bring on that alarmed feeling that made us cover the mirrors in the first place.\nI start to see some things about my insides. Movements under my skin: muscles, heart, ribs. I lift my arm and see the motions at every point\u2014all these arms stuck in the air between the place where my arm was and the place where it is. And a big dark cave where my guts ought to be.\nThe mirror\u2019s telling me something true that no one else can see.\nI\u2019m hot and weak when I finally look away. I go on my stomach for the cool floor, not far from Mister. After a while, I feel cool and slide closer to him. He\u2019s a husky-border collie mix, soft fur smelling of dander and the dirt from outside this place. I hug him into my belly and he sighs. I close my eyes.\nHe\u2019s a special dog. Always so cute, his black and white patterns partly ordered like his mom\u2019s were and partly wild like his daddy\u2019s. Ice blue eyes. He was always special \u2019cause of his looks but later it was \u2019cause he was so smart and good.\nI worried about him all the time when he was a puppy. I\u2019d jump in and save him from every little thing. That\u2019s why he\u2019s such a baby now. Paranoid, Donny says.\nI swear I can almost read Mister\u2019s mind sometimes, and my goodness, he\u2019s unhappy now, restless and stir-crazy and hopeless. He thinks he did something wrong and we\u2019re punishing him.\nIn the space between my belly and his back, I feel something I\u2019ve never felt before\u2014something between warmth and bubbles popping. I hug him real tight and keep thinking I should let go now. I really should, but\u2026 there\u2019s less and less of him to let go of.\nI\u2019m on my back now, pushing his jaw down into my chest. I see clear as day\u2014my body from the waist down, my abs, white boxers, thighs all blue in the light. From my ribs up is the white fur, a furry paw sticking out near my sternum. His jawbone under my hand\u2014and then just my chest bones under my hand. He\u2019s gone!\nHe\u2019s not, of course. He\u2019s part of me now.\nIn the minute it took to take him into me, he never fought, never made a peep. I feel him waking up now, and he doesn\u2019t panic. He doesn\u2019t struggle. He\u2019s warm and safe inside me and knows it. He\u2019s energized, plotting because he knows a lot more now, and he still wants to protect me.\nHe\u2019s grateful. I\u2019m grateful too, at first, but the feeling starts to come that I\u2019ve done something wrong. I don\u2019t care about the people behind the mirrors, but I don\u2019t want Donny to know.\nI want to run. I\u2019ve never felt caged in my life until just this second.\nDonny\u2019s still asleep. I rush to the shower. The water wakes him up, of course, and he\u2019s asking why I\u2019m in there, and I say I got too hot. There\u2019s only a little blood, a couple dark drops that the water washes away.\nWhen I sleep, I dream that I ate Mister, every bit of him, bones and fur and teeth and gristle, watching myself in the mirror the whole time. I dream that when I went into the shower, I left a slick of blood I had to lap up afterward, but that isn\u2019t what happened at all.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDonny paces. He\u2019s mad at me \u2019cause I was the one who told them to send the dogs away.\nHe won\u2019t let Gracey out again. He cleans up her messes with toilet paper and flushes them and swears at the guy on the speaker.\nA bad time. Once, he hurls something into the mirrors. He peeks\u2014just for a second\u2014and says there\u2019s no room behind the mirror. I happen to have my eyes open when he says it, and it\u2019s true. Behind the broken glass is just a wall.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDonny doesn\u2019t say I\u2019m any different. When I pull pieces of my hair around to look, they\u2019re dark and plain, same as always.\nOne time I\u2019m looking in the mirror and the door opens. Donny\u2019s asleep and even if he was up, he wouldn\u2019t look. It\u2019s the gorgeous one with the short hair, wearing a doctor\u2019s coat, leaning in from a bright hallway. She smiles, and the second I start towards her, she clicks the door shut.\nAnother time she says through the speaker, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you do this earlier?\u201d\n\u201cDo what, you crazy bitch?\u201d Donny yells even though he knows I don\u2019t like that word.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cJust let her outside,\u201d I say. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ll take her someplace better.\u201d\nDonny puts his face right up against mine. \u201cThey killed Mister.\u201d\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t,\u201d I say.\nI can\u2019t remember the last time we had a real blow-out. I usually try to make up right away; I\u2019m doing that now. Please, you\u2019re right, and please calm down, on and on like that. I smell that Gracey\u2019s done her business and rush in to take care of it. I don\u2019t know if my cleaning it up will make him madder, but probably not. It\u2019ll probably soften him. The stress-poo is so nasty, but I wipe it with the toilet paper and water and hose off the shower and clean it all again with a little dot of shampoo.\nI wash my hands and feet and dry them before I come back into the room. It\u2019s to the point in the fight where if Donny pushes, I\u2019ll start getting real mad, but if he lets go we can make up. And he\u2019s dying to let go. I see it. He\u2019s on the end of the bed. He holds out his arms, and I go to him. We hold each other. His face is in my belly, and I start to feel warm tingles there. I\u2019m looking sideways into the mirror and see his eyes are open, looking straight up at me.\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d he says.\nI move away and come around the bed, get under the covers. Gracey jumps up and tucks into a ball between us.\n\u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d he says.\n\u201cWe can take Gracey someplace better,\u201d I say. She hasn\u2019t been groomed forever, and I have my hands deep in her rough fur. I don\u2019t know what Donny thinks I\u2019m doing to her, but he starts to pull her like he\u2019s booting her off the bed. I\u2019m already falling into her, covering her with my chest and arms.\n\u201cCome, take part of her,\u201d I say, but he\u2019s off the bed now, just watching. It\u2019s fast and clean as can be, just a few drops of brownish blood on my T-shirt and the covers and that rush of thankful feeling again.\nI\u2019m frozen there in the rush of her. Everything\u2019s frozen in place.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get this cleaned up,\u201d I say, and I go off to scrub the bedspread before the stain sets.\nWhen I get back, he\u2019s at the end of the bed, head in his hands.\n\u201cWhat do you look like to yourself? In the mirror, I mean,\u201d he says.\nI don\u2019t answer \u2019cause he\u2019s still mad. The room feels cool with no covers and nobody to curl up to. I do a few squats, turn to the mirror. If I just glance and do not focus, I think I see what Donny sees, me like I\u2019ve always been but better. Everything tight, skin clear with good color, my plain dark hair somehow glossy. I close my eyes.\n\u201cIf I look long and hard, I see what we\u2019re becoming,\u201d I say.\n\u201cYou\u2019re making it happen faster,\u201d Donny says.\nIt\u2019s true. Whatever life we thought we\u2019d enjoy just a little while longer, it must be over now. Gracey\u2019s just beginning to wake up in me, and I\u2019m already hungry for something more. We ought to be out in the streets now. This rest has done me good, but some kind of struggle is what I need. Some kind of work.\n\u201cYou should be looking, too,\u201d I say. \u201cIt isn\u2019t bad.\u201d I\u2019m thinking of the two of us breaking out together.\n\u201cHow will we ever get home?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be going home,\u201d I say, \u201cbut as long as we\u2019re together\u2026 \u201d\nHe\u2019s heartbroken. He\u2019s thought about dying but he hasn\u2019t thought about living and not going home. We\u2019re all made up, just like that, but he\u2019s ruined.\nHe\u2019s like Mister was before I saved him. Sad and mopey, all the will gone out of him.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI should take him. \u201cCan you?\u201d he asks.\nHe\u2019s nice enough to pretend the thought hasn\u2019t occurred to me.\n\u201cIf it happens, I want you to look in the mirror right after,\u201d he says. \u201cSee if you see me.\u201d He\u2019s scared, but he\u2019s not the type to delay things. He takes off his T-shirt and moves me to his lap.\nI take my shirt off, too, and all at once I\u2019m thinking how much bigger he is\u2014and how he must be hungrier than I am, and I\u2019m scared. I feel his arms around my back and we\u2019re kissing lightly, chest to chest. The last time we tried it in the shower, not too long ago, we couldn\u2019t find my opening. It\u2019s gone. I have my whole hand reaching around in my boxers for it, but it isn\u2019t there. Still, the static feeling stops, and the tingly bubbles-popping feeling doesn\u2019t get stronger, and there are still two of us. We\u2019re grateful. We make out for a while and do a couple of things, take another shower and spend a long time getting dry.\nWe sleep right after. I\u2019m the little spoon, but I\u2019m on his side of the bed, which makes me think, as I drift off, how that never happened before.\nI dream of eating him all up, of course, just like with Mister. I never had that dream with Gracey\u2014she brought doggy dreams like the ones you imagine when you see them yipping and wiggling their feet\u2014but I have the same nightmare all over again for Donny. Gnawing up the bones and licking all over the floor. It\u2019s so gross and goes on such a long time, and when I wake, I feel that guilt all over again, that I\u2019ve done something wrong. I\u2019m alone on the bed, and Donny isn\u2019t in the bathroom. I\u2019m pacing around, thinking they took him and then knowing\u2026 it was me. I took him.\nI have the guilt again, but it isn\u2019t fair \u2019cause I don\u2019t feel him inside me. No good feeling to push back the hurt. I\u2019m about to finally lose it, and then I look into the mirror.\nI focus until the being there shifts and shimmers. It isn\u2019t me exactly, or Gracey, Mister or Donny, but it\u2019s something of all of us, with a gaping cave in its belly. And it reaches\u2014not close to the ceiling, that would be an exaggeration\u2014but it reaches higher than it has any right to.\nMy arms and legs, if I look down at them, if I\u2019m honest? They\u2019re not mine. They\u2019re Donny\u2019s. It was him that got me.\nOnly I don\u2019t think of it that way, not at all. I think of it this way: We\u2019re strong now, and good. We\u2019ll tear apart the corner of the room\u2014the corner where the door is\u2014tear with our teeth, with our claws. Just as soon as I think of it, we\u2019re doing it. Splinters in our mouth, something chalky. We\u2019re whining as we squeeze through the opening.\nWe smell the outdoors and long to be there. But before we go, we take a right turn down a bright hallway.\nWe pass a kitchen so bright our eyes sting, smelling of food and drink and people, and more of the dirt from outdoors\u2014oh my God, the things we smell! Our mouth is dripping wet, and we come to the end of the hall.\nThe gorgeous girl stands by a locker, turns and gasps, and this time it\u2019s not a dream: We take her neck in our sharp teeth. We shake her, one two three, and drop her just as a man runs into the room. We take him by the neck\u2014and our mouth tastes the two distinct flavors of their rich salty blood. It\u2019s the most sensation we\u2019ve ever experienced. We test the flesh of his cheek and find it tough and tender, like nothing so much as sucking at our own wound. With a bit of guilt, we let the meat slip out of our mouth.\nWe turn toward another man, much older. We know this one is good. Is it his scent or his wakeful eyes? The way he holds his hands in surrender? We take this one in that other way\u2014so fast, just a pressing into him and the rush of him waking into us. He is grateful, and he too is hungry.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe people are all holed up behind curtains. A glowing cartoon-character blanket hangs on a window many floors up. It means that room never had a curtain. It means the people are hiding from something.\nWe aren\u2019t curious. After all, we\u2019ve been commuting to work all through the crisis and listening to NPR just about three hours a day\u2014not to mention what we learned through the observations and consultations at the center, not to mention what we learned from friends and family. We know what the scientists know, and we know what their kooky relatives know, and none of it is good, but it doesn\u2019t make any difference.\nIn any case, there is always someone who thinks he can sneak out after curfew\u2014or if there isn\u2019t a straggler, well, doors are our playthings.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what\u2019s happened because we\u2019ll all be together, so many of us now, getting stronger and smarter. We\u2019ll do our work at twilight, and it will warm us through the cold hours.\nSometimes, in the days to come, we\u2019ll feel that we might have done something wrong, but we\u2019ll tell ourselves, \u201cNo, we\u2019ve done right,\u201d and list all of the ways we\u2019ve been right\u2014indeed, righteous. The voices will be so good and so strong\u2014and so many\u2014that we\u2019ll believe them.\nSometimes we feel sorry we can never go home again, but the word comes to us, hiraeth, a name for that feeling. We have known the word for many years, we heard it on a radio show, learned it from our grandmother, a word we just recently learned. The many beasts in us, those who never knew language until now, they find this word especially poignant. And so, when we think of home, we think of hiraeth and a memory of our nests and our mates and our littermates warms us. We mourn for our lost homes as we celebrate the new home we\u2019ve taken in our selves.\nOur body, when we glance in a mirror, is Donny\u2019s fine middle-aged body, shirtless and sweaty, his grizzly beard and thick salt-and-pepper hair grown to his shoulder blades. When we look longer\u2014and by now we have to stand before a mirrored skyscraper at dusk to see our height\u2014we are something else entirely.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue31\/3lbe31_story5.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"Six months ago, we were doing planks and pushups and eating perfect at every meal.

Such an appropriate phrase for her favorite flower.\nRia felt the lingering looks of tourists and heard their questioning words as she walked toward the square. Dressed in a tight black T-shirt, black capris, and high-strapped sandals, she wore a full black wig which held streaks of silver. Pointed silver-framed sunglasses disguised dark brown eyes. She pulled a cart behind her that held a small card table and several canvas chairs.\nLater, the tourists who came to watch the sunset would see her at a booth reading palms and they would remember her from the street.\nThe atmosphere at Mallory Square was like a circus, complete with jugglers, tightropewalkers, statue people, and contortionists \u2014 all working the crowd and asking for small tokens for entertainment before the sun set. With words of welcome or challenge, they yelled, \u201cHey, don\u2019t be afraid to stop. We\u2019re from the Midwest, too. You won\u2019t go away disappointed.\u201d \u201cDig into your pockets. Dig deep. A finer performance you will never see.\u201d\nAs she glanced in the direction of the water and sailboats to see red and yellow flames of the sun melt into the blueness of the ocean, Ria wondered who would visit her booth tonight. She sat down and closed her eyes for a minute and accepted a welcoming from friendly spirits that traveled in the wind, on the ocean and on the beach. They reminded her that she was not alone.\nRia sensed the approach of her first customer.\nThe girl who leaned toward her had china-blue eyes, flawless peach skin, and bleached blond hair tied back into a ponytail. Sitting next to her, her boyfriend looked like he had just stepped into a room full of giggling women where he happened to be the only male.\nIn a quiet, calm voice, Ria said, \u201cTell me your first name.\u201d She gently placed the girl\u2019s hand into her own.\n\u201cIt\u2019s JoLynn.\u201d\n\u201cYou know, the palm is the map work of your life, JoLynn. Every line, finger, and even your nails have a meaning that is unique to each person\u2019s hand. Relax your fingers and if you don\u2019t mind, I'd rather it be just you and I. It\u2019s the energy moving through your hand that I need to feel and there\u2019s too much interference when someone sits so close to you.\u201d\n\u201cHey, I\u2019ll meet you later.\u201d He jumped at the chance to leave and winked at his girlfriend as he departed.\n\u201cYour lifeline is strong and shows good health, hardly ever a cold or sickness. You have strong attachments to your mother and father and sometimes you wish you were back at home, ready to open up the door to the house where you grew up. A little unhappiness there, but you made a choice to travel far from home for your work and that is where you met your boyfriend.\u201d\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s where I met Skip.\u201d\n\u201cAnd where did you meet the other man in your life?\u201d\nIt was a slight movement but Ria had felt tenseness in her fingers. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d JoLynn said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right. I'm not your mother or your confessor. But keeping two men happy and unaware of each other will only become an increasing hardship for you.\u201d Ria paused for a minute and admired the glow of peaches in her complexion.\n\u201cYour heart line, you see how it curves toward the middle and index finger? It indicates a need for attention, sexual and emotional. I'm not sure if one man could fulfill your desires. Sadly for you, there will come a day when one will find out about the other.\u201d\n\u201cI'm not sure how you could get all of that from\u2014 from looking at lines in my hand.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s just where I begin. A touch is all it takes. Then I see images of peoples\u2019 faces from their past and present. Sometimes the color of emotions or even a buried secret or two emerges. It\u2019s a gift that my mother had and before that, her mother.\u201d\n\u201cA gift? I wish I had a gift like that. That way I could see which one really loved me so that I could choose one and dump the other.\u201d JoLynn\u2019s eyes showed excitement.\nMeasuring each word, Ria said quietly, \u201cBe aware that it will be only a matter of time before they discover your secret. And then you may be left all alone.\u201d With a half smile JoLynn nodded, starting to pull her hand away.\n\u201cThere is another thing before you go. The thumb is often overlooked but it reveals so much. In fact, right underneath the thumb rests a small bone that can tell me a few more things.\u201d Ria pressed the bone, picturing how a peach glow would look on her own skin, how a firmness around her eyes would replace wrinkles from the sun\u2014 She felt the girl\u2019s beauty rushing into her hand and course through her body \u2014 another special gift that she had failed to mention. JoLynn wouldn\u2019t miss a few years of beauty; she would have plenty of men who wouldn\u2019t notice a few premature wrinkles.\nFor a moment, Ria thought about how she could return what she had taken. Instead, she pressed the bone underneath JoLynn\u2019s thumb for a few more moments.\nRia finished the reading, no longer touching her hand. She said, \u201cYour long and slender thumb shows an ability to outwit any enemy who will try to harm you.\u201d\nThe words she had just said pulled faintly at her heart, a distant memory\u2014 distant\u2014 her mother\u2019s tale about enemies who would steal away your blood, your soul. Don\u2019t be fooled into thinking the world gives only what you want and desire, Ria. The enemy moves at night, quietly disguised, but poised to steal away what you thought was yours.\nRia smiled without showing her sadness. \u201cThat\u2019s it, my dear, except to wish you a long and peaceful life.\u201d She graciously accepted a twenty-dollar bill, anxious to look into a mirror at her face.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nRia stopped and talked to Amos, who was standing with a deck of cards in his hands, ready to show off a few card tricks to the next passerby. \u201cHow\u2019s business today for you, Amos?\u201d She brushed her hand against his.\n\u201cBusiness is okay. But I am tired and the crowd is a passing-by crowd today. I should get out of the heat and join the other guys for a quick smoke. It\u2019s getting hotter these days\u2014 But enough about me, now. You look refreshed and cool. How do you stay so good looking, Ria?\u201d\n\u201cOh, better get your eyes checked. I'm getting old just like you, sweetheart.\u201d She took his hand again, avoided the thumb and rubbed the mount of Mercury. The images blended in her mind, but she let them scatter untouched into the wind like a dried dandelion at summer\u2019s end. She whispered into his ear, \u201cI think you\u2019ll have a very good day and you won\u2019t have time for that quick smoke after all. When you\u2019re counting all of those dollar bills, you\u2019ll wonder why today was so special. Will I see you at the square tonight?\u201d\n\u201cI'm not sure\u2014 On second thought, I might be too busy to stop at the square \u2014 but I\u2019ll see you around, Ria. I think I\u2019ve got some magic left in me. Those young kids need to learn a trick or two.\u201d She threw him a quick kiss and saw how his shoulders were a little straighter and his hands steadier.\nShe passed the lady in white, one of the statue people, forever still until a tourist dropped change into her basket. Then the ringing of the triangle in her hand would sound and she would bow with the grace of a queen, even grant a faint smile, only to resume a lifeless pose on a pedestal of marble. Oh, to have that kind of elegance. She hoped the lady in white would stop by her booth some night after work.\nThe sun was about to disappear into the ocean as she set up the table and chairs across from vendors selling hand-painted T-shirts and jewelry. A man of about sixty with soft, dark eyes suddenly stood in front of her.\nThe look in his eyes appealed to her. As though he had undressed her and liked what he saw. She did not mind this, for she had already noticed he had a sensuality reminiscent of a young Robert Redford.\n\u201cI'm not quite ready, sir. The sun hasn\u2019t even set yet. You are anxious, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be up front with you and tell you that it\u2019s a hobby of mine to see how much palm readers know and how the readings differ from one to the next.\u201d\nShe sat down and touched his hand, studying the lines and mounts, letting the images appear inside, like a kaleidoscope of dreams. Sitting in a bar for hours on end with a drink in his hand, sometimes alone. Different women in and out of his life. A painter\u2019s easel in front of him, in a room of one canvas after another. Portraits of beautiful women.\nFollowed by shades of grey, dreary and lifeless, bordering on a black loneliness and despair that lived behind the artist.\n\u201cI see.\u201d She said it simply. Practice and experience had given her the skill to mask her surprise or alarm. She continued and spoke pleasantly. \u201cWell, let\u2019s do something a little different with you, so that you don\u2019t become bored with me. I wouldn\u2019t want that to happen. You know the thumb is an interesting place to start but I need to know your name first.\u201d\n\u201cMichael. And yours? I need to know yours as well.\u201d\n\u201cRia.\u201d\n\u201cRia. I like that name and you\u2014 you are a woman of extraordinary beauty. I would be hard pressed to guess how young you are.\u201d\nLaughing softly, she admired his charm.\nPressing the small bone under his thumb, she let the warmth from his eyes course through her body. Her own arm warmed, and suddenly stung. She pulled her hand away, quickly, but professionally. No, not more than a touch of sensuality from him, the grayness was too strong.\nInstead, she pressed against the mount of Venus, speaking in a low voice, \u201cYou have made a long journey in your life, learning a great deal about women and their desires, painting the ideal woman over and over again. Yet, I see that you are afraid to let a real woman into your heart.\u201d\nThe grayness burst into red fire.\nHe shouted, \u201cWait a minute. How can you say these things to me? You don\u2019t know anything about me.\u201d He threw a twenty-dollar bill on the table and hurried away without another word. For a few seconds, he was still in earshot, and she could have given him what he needed, reassurance that love could still be his. Without magic. Without even touching him.\nRia sat back in her chair and wondered if Michael would return when the redness had faded away.\nLooking at herself in a small hand mirror, she put on another coat of lipstick, a peach tone to match the color in her cheeks, deciding that she liked the sensual softness in her eyes. Just a touch was all she had needed.\nShe was ready to tear down the booth when she felt a presence behind her. The lady in white stood elegantly in the moonlight with the triangle in her hand, motionless except for the stirring of ruffles in her long, white dress.\n\u201cGood evening,\u201d Ria said, \u201cTo what do I owe the honor of your company?\u201d\nThe lady in white extended a gloved hand, inviting Ria to touch. Such a graceful gesture that she would have accepted, but a resistance from deep inside made her shake her head.\nThis lady, dressed in white from head to toe, her ruffles not as clean and pure as from afar, whose eyes at a closer view appeared colorless, withdrew the invitation, placed her triangle on the table and removed the glove. Ria watched the glove fall to the ground as lightly as a leaf caught up in a lazy breeze.\nWhen she looked at the lady in white again, she didn\u2019t immediately notice that underneath the glove there was no hand. Not a hand or bones or dust. Just a faint musty smell of the ocean on a day of storm. Like a closed-up room in a house that no one visited anymore.\nHow many times had she passed by the statue lady, whom she had only seen at the square at sunset, never at the bars at night or the shops during the day? In fact, Ria didn\u2019t know a thing about the lady in white. Until now.\nThe lady stepped toward her, extending the palm of the other glove and bowed with a slight flexing at the knee and the beginning of a smile around her lips.\nA hint of elegance, that\u2019s what was being offered here. Ria thought how easy it would be to accept such a gift. She started to reach toward the spirit, feeling the resistance weaken.\nImages spilled into the night. Random, but connected in a way that only the unconscious understood. Images of her life.\nThe smell of jasmine from an orchid, its scent even stronger at night. A peach glow on a young girl\u2019s face. Reds and yellows of the sunset at Mallory Square. A touch that had blessed her with beauty at a whim or by design. Her mother and grandmother laughing and telling a little girl their secrets. And their fears. About the enemies at night, poised to steal away her blood. Her soul.\nImages and a warning now scattered into a marbled sky of blacks and blues at the moment she had touched a white glove.\nThe lady in white picked up the glove and bowed one more time into the face of an invisible wind, feeling the warmth on her cheek and the blood running through her veins.\n\u2022\n\u00a9 2002 Mary Musselman, all rights reserved","source":null,"source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/wJC8yJ1nc1omY6zcYuOYVQ+GeTk.json"}

He has reached the sinking stage, he and the floor, both made of shit, merging. His first time meeting jenkem. Mine was the same.\nI step out of my body, crouch beside him on the mold-rotted floor. To touch him, to shake him awake from stupor, I must reach through flesh that turns or seems to turn to rot and touch him, Mbesi, his soul-sentience, and I must squeeze until he feels a pain that transcends body, nerves and brain.\nHis eyes unglaze and flood with terror as the semblance of drowning becomes indistinct from the reality. Mbesi is drowning, just as we all are drowning, just as I am squatting here beside him, beyond my rotten body, gripping his soul like a vise. Mbesi\u2019s spirit-soul chokes on the fume that fills him and flails for a shore that does not exist. Though I\u2019m his sister \u2014 and the only one who can \u2014 I do not help him. There was no one to help me.\nThe jenkem pot billows and coughs. The cops prowl the alley, battering vagrants who are less lucky than we only because they have not lost the pride that keeps them from seeing their decay. And I wait for Mbesi to complete his seeming death. Yellow tears stream from his eyes; bile bubbles on his lips. Across the room, my body lies unmoving, wrinkled and scarred beyond age, though I am only nineteen. Mbesi could pass for fifteen, though our mother birthed him two years before me. He will look his age, and worse, soon enough.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d I urge him, when death rattles from his throat at last. \u201cWe can\u2019t sit here and wallow. Your lover, remember? We must find her.\u201d\nThe expression on his face as he sits up from his corpse \u2014 I can\u2019t help laughing. \u201cAm I reincarnated?\u201d he asks.\nReincarnation exists, but makes no more difference in the universe than if it did not. Maggots that spring from a human corpse may incorporate that person\u2019s essence, but it does no good asking maggots if their situation has improved. I do not tell him this.\n\u201cI can\u2019t smell the jenkem.\u201d He is trying to force his ghost-body to breathe. \u201cI can\u2019t smell anything \u2014 I can\u2019t feel my body! If I\u2019m not reincarnated, what is this?\u201d\nHe won\u2019t last long in this form, no matter how delicately I attempt to manipulate him. \u201cYou might say,\u201d I explain, \u201cthat jenkem fools the body into releasing the spirit unto death. You might say it makes the body aware of what the soul already knows: that we are death, everything around us is death, and it isn\u2019t growth but decay that moves the universe. Life is an anomalous condition, a temporary absence beyond which death extends in all directions. Life is precious, brief and fragile, and you\u2019re wasting it sitting there.\u201d\nFor now, my urgency shakes him from his fear. He rises and obeys. We climb up and out through the hole in the wall, though the hole is no bigger than a pair of fists together, hardly wider than the sewer-pipe that once departed through it. It doesn\u2019t matter. We could as easily have climbed right through the wall \u2014 if I weren\u2019t so devoted to coddling my brother\u2019s fragile sense of self. He isn\u2019t as desperate yet as I was, though he should be. I have no time to wait.\nIn the alley the cops pound their punching bags, and the punching bags lie there and take it, because they were too cowardly to choose a poison whose effects would let them do anything else. We cross the alley, all but ignoring both cops and crackheads because this city offers fights enough to wear us all to nothing, because choosing one\u2019s fights is among the great and few luxuries of life, and their fight isn\u2019t ours. Instead we dig our ghosts of limbs into the crumbling brick of the tenement opposite and ascend as though arising on a parting gust of jenkem fume, as though we weighed no more than a pair of dirty sheets blown on the wind. We are made not of sheet, but shit, and as this notion comes I cackle again and repeat it like a dying senile with nothing to live for but hideous laughter, and Mbesi looks into the wrinkled ghost of my laughing face and trembles \u2014 and yet he climbs the sheer side of that ruin with as much ease and lightness as I, until we reach the roof.\nOnce there, when he realizes what he has done, when he surveys the spread-cheeked orifice of the city with dropped jaw and the realization that he has allowed that orifice to devour him and emerged as something more, the pride and ambition of our shared blood fills him, as I knew it would, and I know I have won him.\nI have missed Mbesi, since I gave my life to jenkem. It has been a long time since I had a brother.\nWe move by will. A toe on a rooftop, a fingertip on a telephone wire, and that only to keep us from forgetting the necessities of flesh. We float on, immaterial, while the world beneath us rusts.\nI lead Mbesi to the house where his lover has been left to die: a rotting colonial behind a high chain-link fence in an area that once was wealthy. We transcend the fence like shadows. The place has been sealed, doors bolted from the outside, windows blocked with mesh: a prison. We enter unhindered.\nWe find his lover and her child sleeping under a table, curled together. The child is moribund, belly swollen, skin taut over bones, eyes enormous, outsized for their sockets and his head. She, embracing this ghoul-thing, is angelic. The sight enraptures my brother. He makes to lie down, to embrace them. I hide my laugh at his simplicity and wait for him to fail.\nHis arms pass through her, through the child and the floor. He stares at me, cow-eyed, uncomprehending.\n\u201cIf you want to help her, \u201d\u2014 her, I say, and not them, because I\u2019ve seen too many starve not to believe the child will die \u2014 \u201cyou\u2019ll have to do much more than that.\u201d\nThis time I lead Mbesi through the wall. A glimpse of stains behind the baseboard, roaches and rats building nests of their dead, then night again. No stars: too many streetlights, too many cop cars razoring along the roads. No wind. A malarial damp. A nightjar on the hunt flies through Mbesi\u2019s chest. He gasps; I hush him.\nI show him the apartment of his lover\u2019s lover, her supplier, creditor, landlord and pimp. I show him the calendar covered in deadlines, the safe, and the place where the combination is written under the desk. I show him his rival\u2019s sleeping form, huge, lithe, insuperable.\n\u201cYou knew all this?\u201d Mbesi says.\n\u201cI watch them,\u201d I answer. \u201cLike I watch you.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t stop him. You wouldn\u2019t even have told me, if I hadn\u2019t hunted you down.\u201d\nHe\u2019s wrong. \u201cI can\u2019t stop him,\u201d I lie. \u201cSoon I\u2019ll be dead. The dead can change nothing. But you \u2026 \u201d\nIf he possessed any substance, he would try to hurt me now, the way he used to try when we were orphans together and I outwitted him, outraced him to the affections of a stranger and then ignored his efforts to revenge himself as easily as though he were nothing.\nI am smarter, but my brother was never a fool. This time I am so far beyond him he knows he can only endure it. I wonder, as I never did when we were children, whether this time he will hate me.\nMbesi begins to lose control, to be drawn back toward his flesh. His lover is dying, his enemy invincible, his sister a ghost who laughs at his misfortunes, and he himself is a bodiless eye, helpless to do anything but see. I forgive him. He has seen enough for his first night.\nThe truth is, I need Mbesi. Not his help \u2014 not really, though that\u2019s what I\u2019ll tell him. I need him to become what I am. Take my place. Or else I can\u2019t let myself go.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe massed squatters who occupy the tenement\u2019s upper floors paw at us, fling questions and beg, because they know what I am, what I hope Mbesi will become, and because there will never be anyone else they can beg from and condescend to in one breath. They at least can afford to pay for the drugs that kill them and give them escape \u2014 no matter that escape takes all they have and forces them to sell themselves for more; at least they had money once, however briefly. I have nothing but what I can scavenge, the foulness that others excrete. For my drug, my escape, I choose to breathe their shit.\nI tried to help them once and failed; they were too broken to be saved. Perhaps, if I can help Mbesi, he will save them when I\u2019m gone.\nOutside, it is dawn. Mbesi collapses in the street.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to help your lover,\u201d I say, bending over him, my nineteen-year-old ankles trembling, bones calcified, flesh infested with carcinogens and fecal bacteria. \u201cMy body is dying of jenkem, yet I stand, I walk. Because I have purpose. Get up.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did you do this to me?\u201d my brother moans. His cough is wet with jenkem, and his spittle glistens yellow on the tar.\n\u201cI can\u2019t carry you, Mbesi. My body would shatter.\u201d\n\u201cYou knew how to save her. You knew about the other man. You even knew how I could beat him. I came to you for help, and you told me this was the only way. Jenkem.\u201d\n\u201cIt is,\u201d I say. \u201cGet up. Your lover and her pusher-pimp live far away. In this form, we must depend on frail life to propel us.\u201d\nA cop car rounds the corner. I shove my brother into its path. It swerves, speeds away. He gets up, cursing me.\nLeaning on each other, we make our way down the street to the bus. It\u2019s good to have him with me, even if I must be cruel.\nOur stench empties the seats around us. \u201cYour rival,\u201d I whisper, \u201cmeets a courier outside his house at ten past nine. In the moments between when he leaves and returns, you must enter and hide. He will likely put the package in the safe. He then walks to the bodega to collect from a debtor. During this time you will empty the safe, then fetch something for me from the basement.\u201d\nMbesi sits doubled over himself, his eyes red, legs splayed. \u201cGod I\u2019m hungry.\u201d\nAfter four stops, we are thrown off the bus. There are twelve kilometers to go, no bus here again for hours. We walk.\nI\u2019m hungry too.\nAs we pass, people gasp for breath, push money at us, and flee. I don\u2019t even need to beg.\nJenkem lingers on the senses. Nothing I\u2019ve found \u2014 except for death \u2014 can smother it. Food tastes like shit. Drink tastes like shit. I have acquired a taste for burning-hot, bitter-black coffee brewed strong, and for the smoked-dried chile peppers they sell at the grocery on Euphrates Street. I chew chiles like rawhide at breakfast and supper. Washed down with coffee, they taste, like everything else, of things expelled from bowels and then reconsumed \u2014 but also of wood ash and heat.\nMbesi is not the same. At the grocery, he vomits up what I feed him, cries awhile on the floor, then claws his way back to the food and eats more. He\u2019s still a boy, still growing. Until he sampled jenkem, he had not begun to die.\nWhen he manages to keep down enough chocolate and cola to satisfy his need, I drop money in the pool of vomit and drag him out before we are thrown out.\nAs we continue on, I take a coat hanger from the trash, untwist it into a rod and drag it on the street. When one end is sharp, I turn the other down.\n\u201cSo what do we need from his basement?\u201d asks Mbesi. \u201cCan\u2019t you stop making that noise? It hurts my head.\u201d\n\u201cA plastic jug. You\u2019ll know it when you see it.\u201d\nI stop a passing suit, hooking a claw through the band of his watch. He cringes, shrugs it off into my hand. After a glance, I hand it back. His face tells me I have contaminated it, turned his vain device for counting the moments until his dissipation into something he can no longer pretend to possess. He drops it in the gutter.\nMy time is nearly up.\n\u201cHurry on to his house,\u201d I say to Mbesi. \u201cHide in the ceiba tree until he goes out, then run inside and hide yourself. You saw how it was. Find a place.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not coming with me?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want me along. I\u2019m dying of age. After I do, you\u2019ll live without me.\u201d\nHe stops short in the street. \u201cWhy do you keep saying these things? I\u2019m already living without you. When were you ever here when I needed you? Why did I have to come looking for you when the worst had happened? Jenkem. I can\u2019t trust you, sister. I don\u2019t even know you.\u201d His eyes flash with anger, yet I see in them a readiness, a strength. It is this self-reliance, which lies beneath his vain self-worth, that I must cultivate, or soon he\u2019ll be no better off than his lover: a possession. A thing that only sits and counts the time until its death.\n\u201cI\u2019ll meet you at Elise\u2019s house,\u201d I say, and hurry on, leaving him fuming.\nI find I too am fuming, for having allowed myself to name her.\nWhy did I show Mbesi these things? Why have I doomed him to die an old child with lungs full of shit? He desired it. He came to me. Mbesi saw nothing in what I could teach him beyond a way out of his troubles. He was desperate enough that he took it. But I know he needs jenkem, for reasons more than his nearsighted desires. He will benefit by its perspective, become practical, even wise, given time. And when I die, he will become what I was. Not by reincarnation \u2014 he won\u2019t be me. But maybe he can take my place. I must give him time.\nI reach the bodega, the steel grate half-open, no one inside but the owner. I have beaten my enemy here. When he enters, flanked by his addicted underlings, he will demand of his debtor a bottle of flavored-stimulant \u201chealth\u201d water, from the back of the case to ensure it is cold.\nI smash a milk jug on the floor. While the debtor is distracted, I retrieve the bottle my enemy will choose. I open it, squeeze in some \u201cantibacterial\u201d soap from a massive container under the counter. I carefully replace the bottle\u2019s plastic seal, wipe the bottle on my filthy clothes until it looks clean, and replace it.\nThen I retreat to the bathroom, choking back laughter, to wait and cry tears of mirth into my sleeve. Nothing is ever clean. I have been planning this for weeks.\nI huddle in a corner underneath the wipes to wait, cradling my coat-hanger lance in my lap, and settle into the dementia of withdrawal. My body doesn\u2019t need jenkem; it would like nothing more than to be purged, but I need it. I need the knowledge it brings to ward off my terrors. I need detachment, freedom to leave behind my screaming, dying body for the safety of my spirit-soul. I would give anything not to scent this room\u2019s teasing cocktail of excrement and antiseptics, not to feel the cold tile beneath my bare feet or the goosebumps on my wrists. But it\u2019s too late.\nOnce, I would have given all I had to be exactly where I am.\nI did.\nThe bathroom door swings to make way for my enemy. He surveys himself in the mirror, appraising, seeking in his vibrant features, marble muscles, fine clothes the source of the teeth that eat at his gut. His name is Jacques Inongo. He is just a man. Handsome, powerful, immense. Older in years than I will ever be, but in vision, understanding, little better than my brother. Insulated by his serfs, his possessions, his false sense of self-worth. He has not seen his life from the perspective of the dead. He doesn\u2019t know what I know. Still\u2014 residually \u2014 I fear him.\nOnly when he drops his pants and sits on the toilet to purge does he know I am here.\nHe doesn\u2019t recognize me. I\u2019m too hobbled, too decayed, and there have been too many others since he had me. It\u2019s all right; I don\u2019t need his understanding. The irony is enough.\nI am old and slow, but the room is cramped and close, and I am striking before he can scream. With sharp, quick thrusts, I pierce his eyes, his brain. The coat hanger\u2019s ends click and scrape against the inside of his skull. He thrashes a bit, expels gas and a moan, but soon he is dead.\nIn death, his flesh forgets its vanity. His muscles loosen. The contents of his intestines splash into the bowl. I take the keys from his pants, then shove him off the toilet to the floor. With my hands I scoop the sludge of my enemy\u2019s guts from the cold toilet water and drop it, one slithering chunk at a time, into the bottle he left by the sink.\nToilets\u2014the longer I live as a wielder of jenkem, the bigger a joke they become. Smooth, pristine white, designed to conceal, so easily cleaned of the grime that defines them. I make an art of undermining them, subverting their purpose to my own. If I could take my spirit form, I would dive into this toilet and escape through sewer-pipes into the streets. But though he has been released forever, I remain trapped in flesh. Holding his shit to my chest where I can scent it, I hobble through the door.\nOutside, the underlings wait for their parasite master with doting concern. They see me. They\u2019ll remember, once they discover what I\u2019ve done. With luck, when they find me, I\u2019ll be dead.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIn the jug is jenkem, aged and ready. Potent. Yes, I want it. Who knows what has transpired in this city\u2019s rotting bowels since night? What knowledge have I lost, what truths forgotten while trapped here inside my flesh? Jenkem will show me. But not yet.\n\u201cThat\u2019s yours,\u201d I tell him.\nIn the bag are the contents of Jacques Inongo\u2019s safe: drugs \u2014 the kind that cost money and grant only oblivion; a fist of cash, three different denominations; a cache of diamonds; assorted wedding rings of which I know the owners\u2019 fates. And last, the calendar of debts. With all these worthless worldly things, Mbesi could become a pusher-pimp, become another Jacques Inongo, more easily that he could become me. A glance shows me the thought never occurred to him. I love my brother.\nI empty it all down the sewer.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he shouts. \u201cI risked my life to get that \u2014 you can\u2019t throw it away! I stuffed myself into the cupboard under his sink with the rats and the roaches. He nearly caught me. He could have killed me! I could have sold those diamonds, spent the money on Elise, to feed her baby!\u201d\n\u201cGo in. Rescue her.\u201d I give him Jacques Inongo\u2019s keys.\nHe hesitates. He fears her, even though he loves her. Or else fears she is already dead.\nI wait outside. I have no desire to witness the scene.\nShe comes out first, swanlike and emaciated, blind from her imprisonment, ugly with despair. Her son is dead, murdered by one of her lovers; the other failed to save him. She looks through me without seeing; almost, I can believe I have become my spirit-self. Stumbling, sun-blind, she runs off down the street.\nMbesi screams her name. He tries to chase her. I throw my arms around his waist. We fall; black blood flows from his knee. \u201cShe\u2019s going to his house,\u201d I say. \u201cBy now his serfs will have returned there. They will tell her he is dead. If you follow, they will find you. They know I killed him, but they\u2019ll be looking for the thief.\u201d\n\u201cYou killed him?\u201d\nI go into the house. He follows, plodding, a body with no life. I find the dead child under the table and scoop his shit into the bottle with a spoon. \u201cEach body,\u201d I explain, \u201cexpels a different vintage. It must be collected, kept safe, allowed to age, ferment. Only after months of festering will it grant vision. Here, take this. Keep it.\u201d\nBut he doesn\u2019t. He is staring at the child. \u201cHe was alive last night.\u201d\n\u201cListen to me, Mbesi. You\u2019re still an innocent, my brother, even now. You can\u2019t afford to be innocent. You must be cruel and shrewd and bitter to survive. I need you to learn about jenkem. I need you to use it like I did, to find out about the world.\u201d\n\u201cYou knew where they were. You knew what would happen, and you did nothing until I came and begged. You let him die. And now you come in here to drink his shit!\u201d\nIt has happened, and I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. My brother Mbesi hates me at last. It\u2019s too late, but I still try to stop it. \u201cDo you think I wanted you to be this? You could never guess the times I\u2019ve intervened on your behalf \u2014 to prevent you becoming what everyone born to survive in this city must become. To keep you what you were. It was vain of me. Stupid.\u201d How many Jacques Inongos did I kill before I learned it never made a difference? \u201cThe naive don\u2019t survive in this city \u2014 or this world. You have to be cold and rotten inside and know everything. That\u2019s why I chose jenkem.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not my sister. I don\u2019t know who you are. She was cruel when I knew her. Selfish. But even she couldn\u2019t be so callous. You could be anyone under those wrinkles. She must already be dead.\u201d\nMbesi leaves me then. He throws away the pot of jenkem and is gone.\nI don\u2019t see him in the flesh for months.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nElise never returned my brother\u2019s love. To her, Mbesi was a pleasant distraction, a chance to entertain the illusion that someday she might escape Jacques, escape her debts and her addictions, settle down to a life with a father for her child.\nHad Mbesi known this, I suspect he wouldn\u2019t care. He would still keep on searching, still want to protect her.\nI know where she is. I am everywhere; of course I know. She has gone back to filling her needs. She haunts the docks, the hovels by the river, waiting on sailors, selling herself with no-one for protection. The men bruise her, cut her, cheat her of pay. Inevitably, one of them will kill her. But no one tries to lock her up and starve her or demands her love. She mourns her child. Mbesi will never find her. She knows too many of this city\u2019s shadowed crevices, so many more than he.\nAt night, he sleeps, and I watch over him.\nAs my flesh too-rapidly withers, my tolerance for the madness of drowning in the pheromones of death exponentially grows. Where Mbesi lasted a fraction of an hour, I leave my wasting, shriveled self behind for days and days. I wander the sky and the sewers. I troll the muck beneath the river. I drift on the slick that covers the bay. On the rare occasions I return to the pestilent basement where my body lies, it is only to verify the progress of its decay. I don\u2019t bother anymore with collecting new shit to ferment. I no longer accept petitioners begging for secrets and help I can\u2019t give. I do nothing at all to try to change the things I see. I only gnaw on a chile or two, wash them down with coffee, uncork another pot of jenkem, lie back, and dream of death.\nI have never found a limit to that which false death allows me to perceive. If I desired, I believe I could propel my stain across the heavens, play witness to the deaths of nebulae, seek understanding in the desolation of some extrasolar moon. I have never done it. As long as my soul remains linked to my flesh, no matter how frayed the thread, I will always be that tiny bit afraid.\nBut it won\u2019t be long now.\nAfter weeks of walking, finding nothing, Mbesi returns to the house where Jacques Inongo starved Elise\u2019s child to death. He lingers, listless, on the sidewalk, staring through the fence. He shakes the gate and kicks it with his bare and mangled feet. It doesn\u2019t yield; Inongo\u2019s keys no longer fit the lock. I watch at his shoulder, ubiquitous as hunger. I am proud: he never spares a glance for the sewer full of wealth.\nMbesi\u2019s not an idiot; he knows she won\u2019t come back here. This is where her son died, where her lovers failed and betrayed her. He knows by now he\u2019ll never find her walking. That isn\u2019t why he\u2019s here. He came for jenkem: for the jug I made him take from Jacques Inongo\u2019s basement. The jug that, out of hope, he refused.\nHe won\u2019t find it. If he wants it, if he wants to take my place and be this sinking city\u2019s callous ghost, he\u2019ll have to come to me. When he does, I can cut the tether of my flesh. I can go on.\nBut days pass, and he doesn\u2019t come. Beyond desperation, beyond hope, he keeps on wandering the same streets, searching places he\u2019s already searched, finding nothing.\nMeanwhile, the serfs who once played host to Jacques have chosen a new parasite to bleed them. At his command, they search for me, the withered hag who restored their god to his mortality. They ask after me in the streets: \u201cAn ugly, palsied thing, walks with a hunch and stinks of shit,\u201d they say to the vagrants, the starving, the junkies and squatters and drunks. And they find answers. There are few I have not helped, or refused to help, or hurt. Every day they come closer to finding me. After they do, it won\u2019t matter if Mbesi comes or not.\nThey have not yet asked Mbesi. If they did, would he betray me?\nThe first time I ever breathed jenkem, the first time I drowned myself in shit and went on living, the hungry spirit I\u2019d become wanted only revenge: to find Jacques Inongo, and to find a way to beat him. Instead, I found Mbesi, sitting shirtless on a curb among a crowd of sweating boys in the oppressive, draining dark, beating a rhythm on his skinny chest and singing. And I couldn\u2019t help stopping there to watch him, my brother, who I loved. To see him happy, celebrating fickle life in spite of all the rot that crowded it. And I found I couldn\u2019t leave him, couldn\u2019t drag myself away, even though my self was nothing, substanceless as smoke. Even though I knew the danger of my foe, the pain he had wreaked and must wreak upon me, the city, even on Mbesi.\nMbesi will not come now to redeem me. I should arrange for them to find me, step back into my stick-and-paper body, puppet myself up the stairs and out into the street, lie there until a cop car comes to crush me.\nBut still my stubborn brother walks the streets, looking for his lover, and I follow him. I might be his shadow, his own is so thin. I can\u2019t leave him, can\u2019t stop watching him, even to die.\nAnd then Mbesi finds Elise.\nHe runs into her stumbling from the mouth of an alley near the river, between a fishmonger\u2019s shack and a seller of compost. A cop has his hand on her arm; his fingers on her wrist imprint a bruise like the tattoo a possessor inflicts upon chattel. He is not here to arrest her.\nMy brother feels suddenly sick; I know it by the way he hunches, swallowing his bile.\nI step inside his skin. I witness the acid eating at his empty stomach, the foul air burning his lungs, the swell and contract of his heart as his tainted blood erodes him from within, and then I am behind his eyes. He takes in the bruises, the jutting angle of her pelvic bones, the stains of scale and shining fish intestine mottling her dress. The coldness of her as she meets his eyes, knowing it\u2019s too late to hide. I can\u2019t read his mind, only his flesh \u2014 but I\u2019m his sister, and I know him well enough to guess.\nElise tells my brother what I could not. \u201cI don\u2019t love you, Mbesi,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t need you. Kipat loved you, he did, but he\u2019s gone now, so that chance is gone. Go away.\u201d\nEven I couldn\u2019t be cruel enough for that.\nI wonder a moment, while Mbesi withers and I wither inside him \u2014 who is Kipat? But of course she means her child. I forgot he had a name.\nElise trails her abuser away from Mbesi down the street, and with her, the last of my brother\u2019s innocence is gone. He believes her. He would have read the truth in her, even if she hadn\u2019t spoken.\nBut it isn\u2019t all true. Elise needs my brother. She needs his protection, or soon she\u2019ll be dead. If it were me, I\u2019d let her die. But Elise is his Mbesi.\nI return to my body. I resurrect it one last time, awaken it from jenkem visions, a heap of fragile bones and skin forced into human shape. I lift my last unopened jug. I climb the stairs. The jug weighs more than I do.\nIn the tenement lobby, where the squatters huddle, I seek out three young men. \u201cIf you help me,\u201d I croak, \u201cI will tell you where to find a certain sewer grate. If you open it and rake the muck, you\u2019ll find enough wealth to keep all these people in comfort the rest of their lives. Assuming you don\u2019t spend it first on whores and crack.\u201d And they will.\nThe young men do not know me. They shrink from me, as anyone who\u2019s never met jenkem would shrink from a walking corpse. But from all around us come whispers from those who have begged of me and been ill-rewarded or ignored. \u201cDo as she says,\u201d they insist. The boys listen.\nThey take turns carrying me through the streets, until we find Mbesi: slumped on a heap of compost, exactly where I left him, where I knew he would be. I whisper them the secret. They leave me in a pile.\nMbesi stares. I think he would not know me now, but for the jenkem pot.\n\u201cI told you I was dying. Do you understand me now? I made myself this way, by breathing jenkem. But I did it for a reason: it made me wise. It gave me power. Don\u2019t believe Elise, Mbesi. She doesn\u2019t love you now \u2014 but give her time to mourn. The life she is living will kill her too soon, unless you\u2019re watching over her. You\u2019ll have to pay for what you learn, like I have. But you love her that much, I know.\u201d\nI touch my brother\u2019s hand. I can see his inclination to recoil, but he resists.\nThe journey has wearied the husk of my flesh. My eyes glaze, leak yellow, droop. The hard ground pains my bones. I can barely hold the jenkem in my arms.\nIn the street behind Mbesi, the underlings of Jacques Inongo have caught the three young men who carried me. I don\u2019t need my spirit-self to guess their questions. The boys answer, pointing. Can I blame them, when I\u2019ve done so much worse?\nI try to voice my brother\u2019s name, to tell him he must run. My lips won\u2019t form the words. But it\u2019s all right; with Mbesi, I don\u2019t need to speak.\n\u201cI won\u2019t use it like you do,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll learn what I need \u2014 but then I\u2019ll stop. I\u2019ll live.\u201d\nI feel the jug of jenkem lift away.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue28\/3lbe28_story3.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"The jenkem pot lies on the floor between us, its tear-inducing fume of alcohol and excrement weighing like plague on the basement's dank air.

A wash of blue and gold lit up the old school hall turned community centre, splashing raggedly across the choir notice boards and institutional paint and hundred-year-old prize lists full of familiar names, and through a hole as evanescent as a soap bubble I saw a new horizon: green hills, summer sunset skies, a long perspective onto light and color and a different country, far away \u2014 yet one I could reach if I could just step through the door our singing had opened up.\nI could smell it. A sweet breeze ruffled scores across the hall, teasing hair and clothes, and just as a shadow fell across the horizon I and half the other second altos came in at the wrong moment and our fugue collapsed, along with the vision.\nNothing else that evening was really satisfactory. I drove home in the dark, in the rain, my eyes still stinging, and in my head that far off summer country beckoned to me like nowhere here ever had. But it was on the other side of an impossible iridescent fugue, one we might not get right if we rehearsed all year, so I tried to forget it, and failed, and dreamed all night of whatever it was that had been striding across the hills toward us, the sunset burning like a halo at its back.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nYou don\u2019t find voices like that in my little town. The best I\u2019d heard recently was at a strictly amateur church concert, singing about sleep in a luscious mezzo that lacked only a few more years and crisper attention to consonants to be perfect. Amid the whistling recorders and xylophonic renderings of F\u00fcr Elise, she\u2019d snapped my head right back.\nEven she\u2019d need support to sing up a door like that, though. Usually it takes a choir to do that. A well-conducted choir singing the right piece in exactly the right way.\nNo one had told me we were opening doors between worlds this term. I couldn\u2019t find it in any of the newsletters either. \u201cI suppose the question is, where?\u201d said Alex, the Scottish bass, aspirating his whs down at the pub on Monday night. He shifted, glancing at me with uncomfortable warmth. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit ambitious for a spring concert.\u201d\nAlex was half a lifetime younger than any of the other men, just as I was half a lifetime younger than any of the other second altos. Sometimes I felt inevitability weighing down on me like gravity. However, there\u2019s a moment immediately after the flush of satisfaction you get from having accurately gauged someone else\u2019s interest when you think, Oh hell, now I have to go on a date, and I was trying to avoid it. \u201cTen quid for a trip to another world?\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s a draw, I suppose. If you don\u2019t mind probably never coming back.\u201d\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t let people go through,\u201d someone else said, as if I\u2019d meant it seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s just a show.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d go through. Do you think you could make a run from the pulpit before it broke up?\u201d\nThe spring concert, like most of our concerts, would be held in the Baptist church on Angel Hill, which had surprised me the first time with its great grand organ fronted by a choir loft and a pulpit, but with no altar anywhere I could see. It was a fine church, but from a performer\u2019s perspective a bit of a nightmare: the elbowing and reorganization and negotiations over who got to sit where usually cut upwards of half an hour out of the rehearsal immediately prior to the concert. I knew perfectly well I\u2019d be trapped on the steps again, so I let the familiar complaints wash over me until someone stopped at our table and said, \u201cHi.\u201d\nIt was the luscious mezzo from the church concert. She hovered with the bright uncertainty you get when you only know someone slightly, but not slightly enough to ignore them, which I could sympathize with. \u201cHi,\u201d I said, surprised. I hadn\u2019t been sure she was old enough to drink. \u201cIt\u2019s Mei Ling, isn\u2019t it? Bridget introduced us.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Mei Ling, whose name was not Mei Ling, and now would be the time to tell you Alex was not called Alex, either, and as for my name \u2026 well, that never mattered anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s Delia, right?\u201d\nShe looked relieved to be remembered. I always feel like that too. \u201cRight. How are you? Are you here with people?\u201d\nMei Ling looked both ways, then grimaced. \u201cI was, but they\u2019ve gone.\u201d\n\u201cOh, well, feel free to join us. We don\u2019t bite. Much.\u201d\nShe pulled up a chair. I felt pleased until I saw Alex looking at her with interest, whereupon I felt a sting of something wholly unjustifiable, since that hadn\u2019t been going anywhere and I was largely responsible for it. Alex was the best bass we had, with a voice that opened windows in my head and made me think I could listen to him forever, but in the end I always shut my ears and remembered there was more to life than music. Still, it made me uncomfortable to see Alex look at Mei Ling like that. Possibly it was because I knew she had a better voice than me.\nPossibly. I didn\u2019t know her, but I was willing to like her, especially as we sat there gossiping about the choir and Vivaldi\u2019s Delian Door and she expressed curiosity engagingly. I had supposed she was a teenager because I had only seen her wrangling younger siblings, except at the concert, where she had played the violin with the son of a local music teacher for those performances when she wasn\u2019t singing. Out of context she still looked young, but young like an adult, wearing her makeup glamorously. She laughed at something Alex said with her silky plum-colored mouth and I experienced a familiar momentary confusion over whether I wanted to kiss her or be her. I could imagine what it would be like to have her hands on my breasts, but at the same time I would be thinking, what brand is that lipstick? Maybe I should give it a go.\nI drank my drink and sat there contemplating either prospect until Alex shifted uncomfortably and said to Mei Ling, with more hesitation than usual and a glance for me, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try coming along to choir? We always need new people and there\u2019s loads of time till the concert. It won\u2019t be hard to catch up.\u201d\nI was stung again, helplessly and unreasonably, and I wanted to say Alex was wrong and the concert was almost upon us and maybe Mei Ling should try to join the choir next term, by which time she might have forgotten about us altogether. At the same time, though, something leapt in my throat at the prospect of hearing Mei Ling sing with Alex. Their voices would twine and rub together like the slinkiest of cats.\nShe glanced at me too. \u201cHe\u2019s not wrong,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI would like to see a door to another world,\u201d said Mei Ling, as hesitantly as Alex. \u201cWell \u2026 I\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nOver the week I went to work, where routine was routine, and to the dentist, where they were running late, as they have always done, except for once in 2003. And very nearly again in 2005. At the hairdresser\u2019s, the new management had changed only the mirrors. A radio blared glitz and tawdry colors in the corner. \u201cJust a trim,\u201d I said, staring into my washed-out white face. \u201cEnough to take off the split ends, please.\u201d\nI only thought about Vivaldi\u2019s door twice. Once when it hailed on and off all day and in the evening, when I got home, I applied for five new jobs far away even though I knew I\u2019d never get them and probably wouldn\u2019t take them if I did. I sat at my computer inputting qualifications and former employers and thought of selling everything I owned and driving away without leaving a forwarding address, then thought about stepping through a blue-and-gold soap bubble of a door into a different world, who even knows where.\nThe second time was on the Saturday night, after I\u2019d driven twenty-five miles to a concert our musical director had put on with his other choir, the professional one, in the great old Norman Gothic cathedral over in the city. They were singing Bach\u2019s Mass in B Minor and somewhere in the middle of a fugue more fragile and complicated than anything in our Vivaldi I lost track of the polished play of sacred images and wondered instead what made a man write music to open a doorway to nowhere. It\u2019s not that no one ever crossed over to another world before, it\u2019s just that there\u2019s no good reason to do so. There\u2019s nothing there. You step through the Delian Door, it closes, and then\u2026\nAnd then, no one knows. Every other world is different. Possibly when the door flashes out of existence the other world does too.\nIt\u2019s a conjuring trick, that\u2019s all. Just a trick to make you think music can give you something more than a few moments of auditory pleasure. I knew it, and I repeated it over and over to myself, and even so I ached for something blue and gold and out of reach, something I couldn\u2019t find for myself or even really put into words.\nI didn\u2019t have the sort of voice that cuts through locks and opens skylights, or paints the air a wash of rainbow shades for the amusement and delectation of its audience. All I could do was to keep on going through the motions and meanwhile dream of a nowhere-world drawn in crayon colors, a summer country with greener hills and bluer skies and sweeter breezes than anywhere this side of Vivaldi\u2019s door. And if that world vanished along with the door when we stopped singing \u2026 well, if it did, so what?\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWe sang and stumbled and fell together. Misformed images flickered in the air, cohering and collapsing again into indistinct fuzz. I dropped half a dozen notes and saw the results rucking up Vivaldi\u2019s inchoate door like dropped knitting stitches. It didn\u2019t matter. I could hear Mei Ling\u2019s mezzo on my left and Alex singing bass behind me, and the same attraction tugged me both ways like a fishhook through the heart.\nTowards halftime we got the hang of the Judicabit and broke up for tea and coffee with the brilliant after-images still pulsating against the wall. \u201cHello,\u201d said Alex, looking past me at Mei Ling, and I pushed between the chairs to join the queue for tea and left them to it.\nTonight I didn\u2019t mind. I was soaring high on a current of unfounded, exultant optimism that had nothing to do with either of them and everything to do with glimpses of grass and hills snatched through a morass of missed notes. The hall had filled up with cursory chatter and every word not sung was jarring. CON-qua-sa-bit CA-pi-ta, CON-qua-sa-bit CA-pi-ta rattled in my head.\nI felt as if Vivaldi\u2019s summer country was about to reveal itself to me. I stood outside in the dark for five calming minutes and went back inside only when the draw was drawn. I hadn\u2019t won it. Alex was still talking to Mei Ling, whose pinkness might have been due to the stuffiness of the hall, although I didn\u2019t really think so. They were both fiddling with their phones. \u201cBack to work, people,\u201d I said, flapping my hands, and retook my seat.\nI was waiting for the moment when everything came together and the Delian Door opened up again. I don\u2019t know what I thought I\u2019d do then. Lunge for it, maybe, or just stand stock-still and drink it in, this other world that our combined voices had sung into existence. I knew it wasn\u2019t going to happen tonight, but I waited for it anyway.\nIt didn\u2019t happen. Next week, I thought. We might get everything right then.\nI knew better, of course. You never actually get everything right until the concert. I followed Alex and Mei Ling to the pub, where we spent too much of the evening talking about everything everyone else had got wrong. Alex grumbled about the man who sat next to him and I complained about the director\u2019s confusing directions and the level of Mei Ling\u2019s gin and tonic sank slowly until at last she took the last salt and vinegar crisp and said, \u201cI wonder where the door goes?\u201d\n\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d I said. \u201cWherever it is, the weather\u2019s better there.\u201d\n\u201cI just wondered,\u201d Mei Ling said, as if I\u2019d meant it seriously. \u201cSomeone must have come back at some point. Surely?\u201d\n\u201cI was reading up on this the other day, actually,\u201d Alex said. \u201cDid you know Vivaldi wrote the piece for a girls\u2019 choir at an orphanage in Venice? It wasn\u2019t performed very often. They didn\u2019t like it much.\u201d\nI thought about that, or rather about how it must have been to be one of the girls in that choir, staring through a Delian Door to nowhere from the nowhere they already were. I couldn\u2019t believe that not one of them had tried to escape through Vivaldi\u2019s door. Surely there had been some hushed-up disaster. Surely some prized pupil had made a break for it and vanished into the tantalizing meadowsweet-scented aether long ago.\nOr maybe those girls had all been happy in their Venetian birdcage. \u201cI can\u2019t think why,\u201d I said aloud.\n\u201cPeople used to think you could get to heaven through Delian Doors, didn\u2019t they?\u201d Mei Ling said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why no one comes back, because you wouldn\u2019t want to anyway. It\u2019s funny more people didn\u2019t cross over.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you might actually have ended up in hell,\u201d Alex said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t always sunny on the other side.\u201d\nThe ancient Greeks thought Delian Doors took you to where the gods lived, whether in the bright sky or the gloomy underworld, and gods are rarely very keen on being bothered by mortals. I\u2019d done my own reading. \u201cIt\u2019s sunny on the other side of this one,\u201d I said. \u201cThere just aren\u2019t many choirs that could keep one open long enough for anyone to go through. They\u2019ve done a lot of tests and lost a lot of equipment in the process. Nothing\u2019s ever come back. It\u2019s parallel dimensions or dreams or the middle of the sun or the dark side of the moon, whatever. No one knows.\u201d\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be amazing to be the first person to come back through a Delian Door?\u201d Mei Ling said. \u201cIf you can sing yourself there, maybe you can sing yourself back again. Can you imagine? Everyone would want to know what was there.\u201d\nI wasn\u2019t in the mood for this. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be more amazing to go through and not come back at all?\u201d\nThey stared at me. \u201cWould it?\u201d Alex said.\n\u201cI said so, didn\u2019t I?\u201d I was angry suddenly, with a jaggedness that surprised me, and unwilling to sit there making empty conversation in the dark and noise. I picked up my bag and pushed my chair back. \u201cIt\u2019s late. I\u2019m off. Goodnight.\u201d\nI was halfway into the night when Mei Ling caught up with me. \u201cDelia,\u201d she said, and I snatched my sleeve away from her fingertips. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d\nThe details of the pub sharpened and unfocused like a film still: Mei Ling foregrounded, clear and vivid and unmistakably the focal point of the scene, and Alex, dimly rising from his chair, blending into the background over her spotlit shoulder. Mei Ling\u2019s mouth was open. She was obviously concerned, which made me angry again, because it felt like an intrusion on my private self. I didn\u2019t want Mei Ling\u2019s concern. Flashing into my head came the image of her plum lipstick smeared over my bitten throat.\nI jerked away. \u201cFine. See you next week.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI was concentrating on the concert. Maybe we couldn\u2019t hold the door open long enough for anyone to go through. Better choirs had tried and failed. Maybe we couldn\u2019t even open it wide enough to smell the sweet summer breeze. I wanted to see the green rolling fields again, though, and the color of the sky in that other world. That, at least, we could achieve.\nThe last rehearsal before the concert was a mess, as always. I wasn\u2019t rattled by it. I went home and put my concert clothes on and came back out again.\nThis is the bit you will have seen in the news, although not using these names.\nThe Baptist church on Angel Hill was three quarters full, which was not bad at all. We took our places graciously. The orchestra that penned us up in the choir stalls before the organ began to play.\nThe Delian Door unfolded in my mouth a moment before it unfolded on the stage. The words sweetened, then the unstained air, then implebit ruinas twisted on my tongue like a key and the door opened before us. I think the audience gasped. The church was well lit, but nothing compared to the brilliant evening of Vivaldi\u2019s summer country, where the sun had just begun to sink behind the intersecting hills. I couldn\u2019t see anything else. The door sliced through pews and banners and startled faces, and I was transfixed, perhaps even transfigured, and could only stand there channeling the second alto line as it unwound from my annotated page.\nA breath of lilac and meadowsweet wafted past me. The door was holding.\nThe urge to go through the door seized me, as I had known it would, as it had seized me at intermittent intervals ever since I\u2019d first glimpsed Vivaldi\u2019s summer country. I didn\u2019t just want to step from this church into that meadow. I wanted to fling myself face-first through the Delian Door, to land on my knees with hands outstretched and bury my fingers deep in the rich otherworldly grass. It wasn\u2019t just the sights and sounds of that other world I wanted. I wanted to experience the summer country with my whole body. I wanted it so much I couldn\u2019t move. Time seemed to slow down and the summer-scented air grew icy cold and tingled as it touched my face.\nI climbed down from the choir stalls. No one noticed me. I don\u2019t know how many toes I trod on or how I didn\u2019t trip over half the orchestra, but the light blazing out of every entranced face was blinding. Our director was incandescent. One long unwavering note, an A, I think, filled the air.\nI reached out. I meant to fill my hands with sunlight, even the fading sort. I felt resistance, then warmth. I closed my eyes, flung out my arms and fell forward like a winter angel into deep snow.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe door flickered out. The last I saw of either of them was Mei Ling picking herself up on the other side.\nI stood there helplessly as the orchestra juddered to a halt and the whispers began around the startled church. The after-images of the vanished door blazed in my eyes. All around me, the choir had begun to talk about Mei Ling and Alex.\nI couldn\u2019t grasp it. I felt as if a flower had been snatched away as I reached out to pluck it. I had seen so clearly how it would feel to step through the doorway to nowhere and leave the whole world behind. And I hadn\u2019t gone anywhere after all. Mei Ling and Alex might, but for me nothing had changed.\nThey had stolen my door. A scalding wave of anger left me lightheaded. Vivaldi\u2019s door would never open for me again. Every time was different. Every choir was different, and every performance. Everything I sang without Mei Ling or Alex would be different. That particular mix of voices and inflections was lost, and that world was lost as well.\nNumbed, I packed up my music. All I could think about was Vivaldi\u2019s summer country with its meadowsweet breeze and the sun sinking into a scarlet smear. It wasn\u2019t until I finally went out of the church that I remembered the giant\u2019s shadow falling across that other horizon and wondered where it could have gone.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue28\/3lbe28_story6.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"The first time I saw the summer country was when the first fugue of Vivaldi's <em>Dixit<\/em> came together, finally, for a single perfect moment one wintry night.

After four years of collecting diamond rain, I\u2019ve barely met the interest payments after costs.\nThey called us \u2018dream catchers\u2019, once upon a time, because our \u2018catch\u2019 changed the fortunes of entire families on Earth. But that was back when a diamond was still considered precious, before big companies could find insurance to cover their excursions. It was a time at the frontier of a technology that often failed under the pressures of Saturn\u2019s atmosphere, when the value of a haul was measured both in carats and in lives lost. Those were the gold rush days, the days when the wild west of space still existed and anyone with debt inheritors (of at least three generations) could get credit for a ship.\nI remember the day my grandfather left for Saturn. Golden sunlight honeyed the rusty autumnal leaves of his small orchard, and the smell of smoke perfumed the crisp air. His brown eyes, curly black hair and copper skin were gilt in the sun\u2019s light as he leaned toward me. I\u2019m told I look just like him. He stroked my head and smiled with the easy grace of someone sure of the world. He had always been a practical man, believing only in what he could see and touch and know to be true, but after four years of poor harvests and dwindling finances, desperation gave credence to the baseless dream of \u2018hope\u2019.\n\u201cYour father and I will come back soon,\u201d he said, tilting his head the way he did when he was trying to reassure me. \u201cAnd, then, we\u2019ll have a better life. You\u2019re the eldest son, so you\u2019re in charge until we get back.\u201d\nI was thirteen.\nMy grandfather died of a heart attack one month into his journey to Saturn. He never made it to the gas giant. My father died five years later, having never returned home. It took the creditors less than six days to notify us of my father\u2019s death and demand I continue to pay his debt. They didn\u2019t know how he died. One of them suggested suicide, while another said it was sabotage. I could believe either reason, given the desperate measures I\u2019ve taken myself.\nA fork of lightning slowly arches through the brown haze. The ghostly outline of nearby ships bloom into view before disappearing into the nimbus again. The sky\u2019s full of them. Black soot begins to fall like snow. It\u2019s thick and heavy, but Saturn\u2019s pressure means it glides downwards at a snail\u2019s pace. Even now, long before the carbon flakes are crushed into diamonds and are ripe for the picking, I can tell it\u2019s going to be a massive yield. Lightning erupts all around us now. It\u2019s a storm unlike any I\u2019ve seen on Saturn before. I feel a small flutter in my gut as I realize that a tempest like this one might finally set me free of my grandfather\u2019s yoke.\nI wait for the bigger ships to start diving, the ones with better sensors, and I dive after them. I crawl between the sheets of graphite, bumping smaller vessels out of my way. I fight against the thick, soupy atmosphere that wants to crush me or hold me still in its morass. The metallic hydrogen ocean below glows bright white. Already, I can see large chunks of diamonds sitting on its surface. Unlike some of the newbies, I keep my distance from the ocean. Even with my inert polymer, I know the trees of electricity shooting off the metallic waves are enough to kill the electronics in my ship. I watch scores of shiny new vessels, na\u00efve and eager to claim their fortune, fly too low, get struck, and plunge into the ocean\u2019s viscous surface.\nI open the cargo bay and deploy my net. I feel the push of pressure on my ears as my ship\u2019s integrity wanes. I don\u2019t have as much time as the larger ships to remain at these depths, but I have longer than some. My hull creaks in sonorous tones, and I catch sight of a smaller vessel in trouble. Its net crumples and folds in a way it shouldn\u2019t, and I\u2019m glad there\u2019s no open comms as it begins its jolting death throes. I watch the net reluctantly release its catch. A constellation of diamonds drifts in a cluster near the twist of metal and wires that used to be a ship. It\u2019s easy pickings, and everyone knows it. The vultures descend, risking everything for a dream, and I dive with them, just another perpetual dreamer hoping for escape.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue34\/3lbe34_story3.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"I jostle for position at an imaginary start line that stretches thousands of miles wide.

Since she and her daughter Katie had moved in, they\u2019d seen occasional cars rattling down the road, stirring red dust that hung like the ghost of travel in the hot air, until it sank, slowly as a long breath, back to the ruts and round white quartz pebbles like discarded molars lying beside the road. Lattimer hadn\u2019t thought much of it as they clanked and gritted past. Old cars, rural cars, nothing less than a decade old, with spider webbed cracks in at least one window and red pits freckling the bumpers, where fading blue and white stickers cheered a high school forced to close six years ago \u2014 go arroyo rats!\n\u201cThe piss witch,\u201d Katie said.\n\u201cWhy that?\u201d\nHer nose wrinkled as she stated the obvious. \u201cI believe it\u2019s because she uses\u2026.\u201d She hesitated, knowing her mother\u2019s distaste for the organic. \u201cUrine.\u201d\n\u201cUrine.\u201d Her voice was as flat as the white tile counter her hands splayed on. She leaned on them, anger clenching her throat. Everywhere, this sort of vile human behavior. People lived by modern day versions of Nostradamus, lice-ridden with superstition like medieval peasants. \u201cFor magic.\u201d\nKatie was making a peanut butter sandwich. Diana could have made it for her, but the teen had a way of eyeing the triangles, as precise as if made by a ruler. It was Diana\u2019s nature. She couldn\u2019t help it. Katie didn\u2019t even cut the sandwich in half before jamming it in a plastic bag but she didn\u2019t say anything about that.\n\u201cThe guy at the coffee shop said yeah, she was a witch. He didn\u2019t call her an elder or a wisewoman, went straight to witch.\u201d\n\u201cIs she Native American?\u201d She\u2019d only seen the old woman from a distance, hunched over rocks, climbing up a slope. While out walking, watching the ground for snakes and scorpions, the rattle of a rolling rock had grabbed her attention. She looked up in time to see the hunched figure scuttling over a rise. She realized then she\u2019d come too far. Diana had trespassed and instead of greeting her or even asking her to leave, the other woman had fled. She thought it should have made her feel ashamed. Instead an obscure anger smoldered. She\u2019d been evaluated and judged capable of harm on looks alone.\nKatie filled a second bag with marshmallows and potato chips. The idiosyncratic feeding habits of the American teenager. \u201cNo, she\u2019s some old white hippie.\u201d\nThat explained a lot. Perhaps some disgruntled feminist extremist. A Wiccan feminist, strung with crystals and scavenged feathers, talking to the spirits of the rocks and stream.\nBut with a disturbing emphasis on bodily waste.\n\u201cHow does she use it in magic?\u201d\nKatie rolled the top of her lunch bag closed. She planned to go spend the day sketching, and Diana had agreed with the understanding Katie would make up her daily lessons after dinner. She was home-schooled and frighteningly precocious in some areas, a long-limbed mixture of arrogance and shyness that saved her from the fools of the world, as it had her mother all her life.\n\u201cAs an ingredient in rituals, I guess, Based on my in-depth knowledge of magic, gathered from fantasy novels and Syfy TV. Not that I can access the latter here in the boonies.\u201d\n\u201cIt will be a good summer,\u201d Diana said. \u201cLet me finish the book. Then we can go home.\u201d She wanted Katie\u2019s last year before college to be a good one, even with the shadow of the divorce hanging over it.\nKatie shrugged, one of those unsettling, boneless teen gestures. She kissed her mother\u2019s cheek, a rare gesture that made Diana smile and forget to remind her about sunscreen, before she slipped out the screen door, whistling. Katie always whistled when walking. Diana teased her that she\u2019d never be able to sneak up on anyone.\nThe sensation of the kiss lingered on her skin as she drank the rest of her coffee, mentally gathering herself before going back in to face the book that was absolutely, unequivocally, advance-back-if-you-don\u2019t, due at summer\u2019s end. The definitive history of science in the 20th century.\nHumanity had come so far, but meanwhile two miles up the road, a woman was casting spells using urine. And, based on what Katie had said, making a living at it. A skimpy cabin in the hills existence, but she had to buy food and generator fuel, at least.\nA piss witch. Revolting.\nThe words on the screen danced and flickered, jittering ants, a swarm of spindly, deformed insects. Diana went to the window and stretched. Wind hissed in the sagebrush. She liked this landscape. She\u2019d grown up in the Pacific Northwest, full of water, dampness, life. Mold. She\u2019d come to think of her life as molded over in the way the tree trunks accumulated lichen there. Looking solid from the outside but falling apart into decay if you poked a finger in it. And at its heart, an absence, a hollow, shaped like Brad, who had been infuriating while present, but proved something else entirely when gone, saying that at 45, he wanted to do something more than be part of the team Diana had always assumed they formed.\nDiana supposed she must be as much at blame for it all as he, but she was damned if she could see how.\nTires rolled by outside, didn\u2019t stop, kept going. Another supplicant to the piss witch.\nShe shouldn\u2019t judge the woman till she\u2019d spoken to her. There might be some science at the root of it all. Many medicines came from herbal remedies: aspirin from willow bark, for one, or penicillin itself from a bit of moldy bread. No one lived in this day and age without knowing that science was more powerful than prayer or ritual. You couldn\u2019t say that outright, lest you be accused of trampling on someone\u2019s religious freedom but still \u2014 everyone knew it.\nDiana would go and talk to her before she made up her mind. And even if she was some sort of mental primitive or Luddite, she could take that in stride.\nIt wasn\u2019t as though anything they did could affect each other.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBottles, sunk into the thick adobe walls, mostly green and clear and brown, with a few blue scattered among them. The necks stuck out, unstoppered, to catch the wind. Odd little wooden contrivances \u2014 was that what people meant by Aeolian harps? \u2014 sang in the wind.\nThe house crouched in a dell between three hills, shaded and cool despite the dryness. A stone-ringed well beside the tiny structure, rounded like an igloo, so much a part of the landscape that it seemed grown rather than built. A front porch like a secret cavern, adobe walls cupped hands around it. Piled high with what seemed trash and debris at first but revealed itself on closer inspection as bundles of dried herbs tied with blue and red string, a looped pile of old agave-fiber rope, a stack of old plates, their edges a writhing vine, as though mold had overtaken the china and blossomed in fractal patterns along the cracks. Dust sifted across abandoned spider webs, their former inhabitants consumed by the snake flicker that eased away from her foot on the step.\nOn the door where a knocker might have been in a more formal establishment, a little doll made of rabbit fur and purple plastic, a Swarovski glitter at its throat. She started to reach out, hesitant. Who knew what germs it might carry?\nThe door creaked open.\nThe piss witch certainly had the theater of it all down.\nShe stood there in silhouette; there was a blaze of light behind her, the sunlight funneled through the bottles on the unshaded western wall.\nDiana didn\u2019t know what to call her, she realized.\n\u201cDr. Lattimer, I presume.\u201d\nShe\u2019d expected an old woman\u2019s rasp or shrill. This voice was smooth, self-assured. Was the witch younger than she\u2019d been led to think? But when the figure stepped forward, she saw that wasn\u2019t the case. Eighty or ninety years of wrinkles \u2014 there was a point where you just couldn\u2019t tell anymore. Dressed more neatly than she\u2019d supposed: a denim shirt embroidered with red roses, blue jeans, sandals that exposed gnarled but neatly kept toes.\n\u201cI\u2019m Hannah Otto. But perhaps you know that already.\u201d\n\u201cI came to introduce myself,\u201d Diana said. \u201cGet acquainted.\u201d The old woman showed none of the shyness that she\u2019d exhibited before and Diana felt her own caution drop away. A touch of plumpness to Hannah\u2019s face made her revise her idea of the so-called witch\u2019s age again, but surely it didn\u2019t matter. This charming woman was clearly innocent of the bizarre things the boy in the coffee shop had told Katie.\nHannah stood aside from the door. \u201cCome in.\u201d\nShe ducked her head as she passed through the doorway, even though the lintel was well above her scalp. The room was open, large. Shelves lined the walls, holding row after row of stone eggs, each placed in a small stand that held it upright, narrow point uppermost. They were made of granite, lapis-lazuli, sandstone, agate \u2014 a bewildering array of colors and sheens repeated in shape after shape, ranging from the size of a quail\u2019s egg up to larger monsters that could only have been laid by rocs or dragons.\nIt reminded her more of an art gallery than museum. She could see nothing but the shelves at first, then she began to take in other details: a table strewn with handwritten notes; a low couch with blanket and pillow half-buried among the cushions; an archway leading to a second room. There was only one broad-silled window, but it was barely visible, covered with strands of wire and yarn to create something caught halfway between dreamcatcher and ojo de dios.\nThe air in the room was almost stifling. The presence of the eggs seemed oppressive, an invisible force weighing her down into immobility.\nHannah said, \u201cYou\u2019ve come for a purpose other than gawking, I presume.\u201d\nDiana realized she\u2019d gone slack jawed, examining the conglomeration. Beads were knotted into it, and barred gold and blue feathers, and other tiny dolls. She shut her mouth so quickly her teeth snapped together.\n\u201cAn interesting collection,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe stone eggs? Do you know the legend? They\u2019re what madness hatches out of. As long as they are uncracked, the world is sane.\u201d\nShe struggled with the incomprehensible, unanswerable words. \u201cI thought since we were neighbors\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThat you\u2019d come by and borrow a cup of sugar or my hedge clippers?\u201d she said. \u201cAlas, I\u2019m fresh out of both commodities. The first is poison to the body, the second a misguided attempt to change the landscape.\u201d\n\u201cJust to introduce myself,\u201d she said with a touch of defiance stirred by the mockery in the old woman\u2019s tone. Diana wasn\u2019t sure whether she believed what she was saying, or whether she was making fun of her preconceived notions. Embarrassed heat crawled along the back of her neck. She could deal with unpleasant men, but other women were unsettling, as though there was always some unguessable subtext to their words. She continued into the silence. \u201cI\u2019m working on a book this summer.\u201d\n\u201cA history of science.\u201d\nHer unexpected knowledge alarmed Diana. Had she been spying, talking to people in town?\n\u201cYour daughter told me.\u201d\n\u201cKatie?\u201d The stupidity of that inadvertent exclamation stunned Diana. How many daughters did she have, after all?\n\u201cI\u2019ve been teaching her.\u201d\n\u201cTeaching her what?\u201d The thought of Katie in this room, the filthy surroundings outside, roused her to anger more than the realization she\u2019d kept this from her mother.\n\u201cTeaching her woman things,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cShe\u2019s lonely.\u201d\nThat shamed and angered Diana at the same time. It was true, but how dare this woman speak as though telling her some secret of her own child\u2019s? Katie didn\u2019t keep things from him. They shared secret jokes, commentary on the world. It had irritated Brad sometimes, that secret bond. He claimed they ganged up on him though it wasn\u2019t true. Sometimes they poked a little fun at his foibles, that was all.\nShe said, \u201cKatie has plenty to keep her busy. She\u2019s studying for the GREs this summer. She needs to focus on that.\u201d\nHer eyes flicked over the eggs. Their silent presence was disturbing, as though they were somehow watching her.\nHannah shrugged but said nothing.\nShe said, \u201cWell. It was pleasant to meet you.\u201d She\u2019d go home and talk to Katie. She\u2019d have to be firm and yet not make this seem alluring in its forbidden nature. Teenagers wanted boundaries to break. Instead she\u2019d discourage her somehow. Or give her more to do, take more interest in her daily studies. She\u2019d benefit from being pushed a little harder. Everyone did.\nBut the words that emerged next from her mouth startled her.\n\u201cDo you pretend to cast spells for her?\u201d\n\u201cI pretend nothing,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cAsk your daughter.\u201d\nShe looked at the table.\n\u201cI was a scientist too,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cBut there are more things in heaven and hell, Horatio, than your cold science imagines.\u201d\nDiana rolled her eyes at the melodrama and exited.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d like them. Stories about science. How penicillin was discovered by accident. She says the best science comes from accidents.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not science,\u201d Diana said. \u201cScience is built on assumptions and theorems being tested. It builds on a solid foundation, doesn\u2019t flit around discovering things by accident.\u201d\n\u201cBut isn\u2019t that how penicillin was discovered?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Sometimes there are accidents, sure. But it takes a scientist to observe the unexpected data and find a way to explain it.\u201d\nKatie took on a sly look. \u201cI learn new words from her sometimes. She\u2019s like reading a dictionary. Chthonic, and effulgent, and soricide. She talks about mythology sometimes too.\u201d\nShe\u2019d always believed in broadening Katie\u2019s horizons, by showing her museums and exhibition, by insisting that for every crap novel she digested, its cover full of elves with swords and blazing phoenixes, there had to be a nonfiction book to balance it out, although the girl often cheated (Diana felt) by opting for biographies, which were practically the same thing as fiction.\nShe pushed a text at her daughter \u201cHaven\u2019t seen you crack this math yet. Trigonometry, chapter three. Be ready to talk about it after dinner.\u201d\nFor a long tense moment she thought Katie might actually refuse. Her beautiful, brilliant daughter \u2014 she\u2019d shaped her with educational toys, with books, with afterschool lessons \u2014 stood perched on one long leg like a stork, arms crossed, and a frown on her face.\nThen she sighed and unfolded herself to lean forward and take the book. She left the room without a word.\nDiana hadn\u2019t lost her. She wasn\u2019t like the parents who gave up, who let their children slide away into the unfathomable world of this century, lost to texting or sexting or video games or other incomprehensible trivialities.\nBrad wasn\u2019t helpful on the phone. She\u2019d caught him in the middle of preparing for a dinner party, she gathered. But she kept him on the line. Surely he could spare a half hour for talking about their daughter, for Christ\u2019s sake.\nShe didn\u2019t give Brad a precise picture of Hannah. She suspected that her ex-husband\u2019s allegiance might fall more into alignment with the crazy woman\u2019s than she\u2019d like. He\u2019d gone so far as to suggest they might all go to church at one point, though he\u2019d been smart enough to pose it as something to do for Katie\u2019s social, rather than spiritual, development. Instead Diana focused on the counter culture aspect, hinting darkly about drugs.\nThere too, she found his response disappointed her.\n\u201cIf you think Katie hasn\u2019t smoked a joint or two by now,\u201d Brad said, \u201cyou don\u2019t remember being a teenager very well.\u201d\n\u201cI was never like that,\u201d she said.\nThere was silence for at the other end of the line. \u201cPerhaps it all boils down to that,\u201d Brad finally said, his tone meditative. \u201cBut maybe you don\u2019t remember how it is for girls. I know how it was for my sisters. They take away your options and give you a princess tiara instead. And then around this age, Katie\u2019s age, you realize how shoddy it is \u2014 maybe, if you\u2019re one of the unlucky ones who see through it all. And so you want something to compensate. That\u2019s the pull of so-called women\u2019s wisdom. The promise that there\u2019s something there to compensate for the shittiness of it all.\u201d\nBrad had always been good at the sensitive man act. \u201cYou\u2019re babbling,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy would Katie want a tiara?\u201d\n\u201cDiana, just let her be. She\u2019s a kid. Let her do kid things this summer. If those include befriending old hippie women, well, there\u2019s worse things she could do.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhich was why, when flipping through the sketchbook she\u2019d left on a side table, the picture struck her like a blow, almost nauseated her.\nHannah, certainly. But worse, a nude Hannah, reclining on the couch with a blanket drawn about her. Drawn with Katie\u2019s precise eye, which caught every wrinkle, every fold. Not drawn with a lover\u2019s eye, she thought anxiously. Nothing like that. But still\u2026\nShe tore it roughly out of the book and searched for others like it, but there were none. Though there were others of Hannah, quick studies: writing at a table; stirring a pan at the stove; weaving something with string and feathers, a smaller version of the mass that had filled her window.\nA storm of fury carried her into Katie's room. The girl lay across her bed, reading something with yet another lurid cover.\nDiana brandished the paper at her.\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\nShe glimpsed the image as it waved back and forth. Her eyes widened in alarm. \u201cThat\u2019s private!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cWhy were you going through my sketch book?\u201d\n\u201cThis proves I was right to do so! I could have her arrested for this.\u201d\n\u201cI need to practice and Hannah offered,\u201d Katie said. \u201cI don't have anyone else to draw.\u201d Her face reddened, as she understood the conclusion that had been drawn. \u201cIt\u2019s just a picture. Oh my God, you are so unbelievably gross!\u201d\nHer anger paled at the tone. Katie hadn\u2019t done anything like Diana imagined, hadn\u2019t debauched by the older woman. But she should have known better. What sort of adult offered to disrobe in front of a teenager?\n\u201cYou\u2019re never to see her again.\u201d\n\u201cOr else what?\u201d Katie snapped. \u201cYou\u2019ll ground me? This whole place is like being grounded. Nothing to do but study or draw.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a roof over your head, clothes to wear, and a brand-new iPod to listen to your favorite tripe on,\u201d she retorted. \u201cDo you know how many kids don\u2019t have as much?\u201d\nKatie\u2019s shoulders set stubbornly.\n\u201cPromise me,\u201d Diana said.\n\u201cPromise you what?\u201d\n\u201cThat you won\u2019t go over bothering her any more.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d she said.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Brad said when she broached the notion. \u201cI\u2019m traveling most of July and all of August. She\u2019d be here by herself.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe we could hire someone\u2026\u201d\nHe snorted. \u201cHire a companion for our teenager? Look, Diana, how much trouble can she get into, as isolated as that place is? If your worst fear is that an old woman might offer her a toke or persuade her not to shave her legs, that\u2019s really a first world problem, and my sympathy is nil.\u201d\nIt reminded her of what she\u2019d told Katie. \u201cShe should be grateful,\u201d she muttered sullenly.\n\u201cGrateful to be taken away from her friends the summer of her junior year? I don\u2019t think so. But I agree, she could be more graceful about it all.\u201d\nThe conversation fell away into inanities. Diana couldn\u2019t ask the question she really wanted to: What can Hannah give her that I\u2019m not?\nLying in bed that night, she was tormented by thoughts and questions. Katie had her whole life ahead of her. Did she really begrudge her mother a summer for writing what could change their lives, if it were as popular as she hoped? Bringing in enough money that she wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the financial impact of splitting the household or impending college tuition. Diana wanted her child to have every advantage, every opportunity. An isolated summer \u2014 and wasn\u2019t isolation required for creative effort, after all? \u2014 was hardly an unreasonable price to pay.\nShe rose and pulled her robe on before padding down the hallway to Katie\u2019s door.\nA sliver of light showed beneath it \u2014 she was still up. Diana didn\u2019t knock, just pushed the door open. Katie, still reading on the bed, only a few pages from the end. She blinked, looking up, like an owl emerging from another world.\nTwo quick steps took Diana forward, within reach. She plucked the book from her daughter\u2019s grasp and said, \u201cGo to bed.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do that! I was on the last chapter!\u201d As animated as she\u2019d ever seen Katie. In defense of this trash? Her sympathy was gone. Maybe she would have relented, if Katie hadn\u2019t reacted so unexpectedly that afternoon. She turned, ignoring the outraged wail, taking the book with her.\nShe thought she might use it to lull herself to sleep, but it was incomprehensible and there seemed to be altogether too much focus on talking magic swords. She snorted and put it in the bedside table.\nIn the morning, Katie made it clear she wasn\u2019t speaking to her mother. The latest salvo in their distressing war, but an ineffectual one, an attempt to disturb Diana that she\u2019d ignore. Deprived of Katie\u2019s chatter? Well, that might actually help her focus. She acted as though she didn\u2019t notice, simply giving directions about the texts to work on that day, and ignoring the lack of reply.\nAt her desk, she lost herself in the writing, pulling together threads, weaving them into her narrative. It disturbed her a little that so much science did appear the result of accident, some serendipitous collision. Saccharin, the result of unwashed hands after an experiment. Vulcanized rubber, due to a spill. Plastic, a failed exercise in creating shellac. Even radioactivity, when a uranium rock was left in a drawer next to unexposed film. She had to describe them, certainly, but she downplayed them when she could, or pointed to the scientific training and experience that had led to that moment of discovery.\nAt noon she went down for lunch, Katie wasn\u2019t there. Her first emotion was anger. Resignation followed on its heels. What did it matter where she spent her day? But she couldn\u2019t relax into that thought the way she wanted to, couldn\u2019t relinquish control in the way it required.\nShe went back up, still jittery with irritation, but the work soothed her as she fell back into its familiar rhythm, fingers clicking over the keyboard, a sound like rain as she collected thoughts, quotes, observations, and tucked them into the web of words.\nWhen she went back down for dinner, Katie was still gone.\nFor the first time a glimmer of worry flickered within her anger. From the first moment she\u2019d first held her daughter, she\u2019d worried. If she could have wrapped her in bubble wrap to preserve her from all the world\u2019s possible accidents, she would have.\nKatie had to be at Hannah Otto\u2019s. That was preferable to being lost in the arroyos, to have fallen and hurt herself or been bitten by a snake or attacked by wild dogs. Or a human predator, taking advantage of the isolation Diana had once thought so safe.\nBy the time she made her way to the cottage, dusk had fallen, a sage-scented twilight that made her step warily along the dusty road. The window shone, the light barely able to pass through the fibers choking it. The air was alive with the moans of the wind passing over the bottles.\nShe knocked. No one answered. No movement from inside. She tested the doorknob, but it resisted her.\nThere had to be a back door. She circled the small house, stepping carefully to avoid detection. As she passed the window, she tried to peer in, but could see only strings and knots obscuring the interior.\nAs she neared the back of the house, she heard voices. Rounding the corner, moving stealthily, she caught sight of Katie and the old woman, sitting outside the open door on the stoop.\nThey were speaking too low for her to hear. After a moment, Katie took the basket beside her and rose, saying something to Hannah as she moved off between two hills.\nWhat was going on? She waited till the sound of Katie\u2019s footsteps had faded before moving out into the moonlight where Hannah could see her.\nThe old woman seemed unsurprised. Diana wondered what Katie had told her about her mother\u2019s objections.\n\u201cWhere has she gone?\u201d she said.\n\u201cOver to the arroyo. To gather stones.\u201d\n\u201cFor a spell?\u201d Her sneer filled her voice, but Hannah only nodded.\nHer gaze flicked in through the open door to the room inside. A shelf, filled with bottles of liquid, caught the light and refracted it in yellow and amber glints.\nHer stomach roiled. She said. \u201cTeaching her superstition is one thing. She can evaluate the validity of all that. I can walk her through the proofs. The equations. But using human filth, is that necessary?\u201d\nHannah tilted her head, examining her visitor\u2019s face as though deciphering a page of notes.\n\u201cEquations,\u201d she said. \u201cOld equations. Cold equations, made of metal and chalk. Surely you\u2019ve realized there\u2019s more to it all than that. Forces of serendipity and ill luck as well as intentionality. Your science is very sterile and clean, Ms. Lattimer. There\u2019s no room for a teenager in it. But it was built by living things, and there are other equations for them, equations of blood and mold and things born of decay.\u201d\nShe stepped forward, towering over Hannah for a second before she rose to meet the advance. They were the same height. Their stares meshed, converged.\nHer hands went out to grab Hannah\u2019s shoulders, not sure whether she meant to shake her into sense or simply make her be still and listen.\nThe old woman recoiled as Diana grabbed. She made a choked noise and her hand fluttered at her throat as though she were unable to catch her breath. Diana started to step forward, hesitated. Hannah\u2019s mouth opened and closed, opened and closed as she slid to the ground, gasping.\nImpossible, that she could be so fragile. An old woman of the desert, self-reliant, strong and sinewy. Unkillable.\nThe moonlight shone on her ribs as they heaved for breath once, twice, and a third, last time.\nDiana stood there, watching the other woman grow still.\nFinally, the lilt of a whistle told her Katie was coming back through the darkness, returning to her mother.\nIn the empty main room of the cabin, the stone eggs began to hatch.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue25\/3lbe25_story2.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"Diana Lattimer hadn't paid much attention to the old woman living further up Canyon Creek Road.

She\u2019s never before received an actual letter, delivered by automated drone like any pizza or recreational pharmaceutical. On the envelope\u2019s front is written her name and exact geopoint, and below that, the name of the city where she lives. This last is an anachronistic flourish; precise geotags would be sufficient for pizza and mail delivery even if more than one functioning city existed in the world. But it\u2019s the first pen-and-ink handwriting she\u2019s seen outside museums and curio shops. It makes the envelope seem precious, a commodity of exaggerated value or importance.\nInside is an invitation, a linen card inscribed with a second geopoint her phone tells her sits at the edge of the city, the encroachment edge, where it pushes back the north\u2019s new humid untamed jungles of hyper-rapid vegetal mutations and asphalt-eating microbes and newly secret secrets. She swipes for terrain settings with her arthritic thumb, but live satellite feeds show only enormous swaths of unsettled greenery, treetops relayed back to her from space. On the heavy linen card\u2019s front is an embossed stylized print of an elephant, all precise circles and triangles, more architectural than animal. Flipping it over she finds, in the same decadent pen and winding ink of the envelope\u2019s front, a lone sentence: The elephant can free you.\nA zipping tingle tugs the base of her crooked spine, ripples up and inward before dissipating back down between her chronically aching legs. Anyone with access to Charlie\u2019s public consumer data and aggregated personality profiles could guess this would be a good calling card, a compelling lure. Elephants might be gone from the world, but there\u2019s no denying Charlie has always felt trapped. Trapped by the physical limitations of her grinding joints and constant pain. Trapped by her parents\u2019 eternal nebulous fears for their safety and wealth (moot now, their safe expensive airplane scattered across the bottoms of oceans deeper than mountains are high). On good days, the glass tower where she grew up and still lives feels like a prison. On less-good days it\u2019s more a mausoleum, and in the middle of those nights she lies shaking with rage and dread and agony alone in darkness by herself\u2014all her bones unknitting, her life ticking past one wet breath at a time\u2014it feels most like a luxury coffin.\nHer hands are extra stiff today, connective tissue loosing its tenuous grip on the rubbled ends of her knucklebones, the bases of her opposable thumbs, her clicking wrists. With difficulty she tugs over her swollen offkilter kneecaps and the pelvic ridges of her canted hips her best outdoor frock (black sheath neck to ankle, with long scooped square pocket sleeves like an antique kimono) and swipe-orders a car which pings its own arrival an instant later. On her way out the door she pauses at her parents\u2019 netsuke case, an illuminated towering display of glass and slim metal bands rising from floor to ceiling in unintentional mimicry of the sky-scraping tower where it sits. From the thousand exquisite ivory carvings the size and shape of bleached chestnuts her gnarled fingers clamp on one, an elephant, and drop it into her deep sleeve.\nCity stutters past the automated taxi\u2019s tinted grey windows, a tinted grey scape of concrete and squared puzzlebox patches of sky. The land shifts subtly, then abruptly, tall buildings then short buildings then no buildings. Jungled vegetation outside suggests the luxury of private ownership rather than the desolation of abandonment.\nThe driverless vehicle spits Charlie out and pulses away on the slick black road under inaudible instructions riding invisible waves. A path cuts through tangled mutated jungle growth, leading to a low sprawling manse under a treed canopy. The massive irregular house clutches the ground, dense looping roots of trees and vines crowding its foundations. Unfamiliar insect chirring saws the air.\nA man answers her cramp-fisted knock. Small, exquisitely formed, polished skin and etched features reminding her of the netsuke weighting the fold of her pocketlike sleeve. \u201cThe invited has arrived, yes, yes!\u201d he sings out with breathy sibilance, announcing her to no one Charlie can see. He smiles widely to expose flat empty gums pink as newborn mice, no teeth at all, and holds out his hand. \u201cYour device, please. Yes. Yes.\u201d\nCharlie welcomes the first stirrings of unease. She hates about herself the numbness increasingly clogging her insides like a fungus, a cancer. The handwritten invitation has sparked in her something she\u2019d classified extinct as sabretooth tigers, rare as unicorns: curiosity.\nShe hands over her phone and steps in behind the toothless man.\nInside, she sees the house is not a house. It isn\u2019t built as houses are commonly built, hacked stone stacked on hacked stone, murdered branch spiked and hammered to murdered branch, the violence of it all. This enormous house is a grove, a ring of immense trees growing tight together, knots and gaps appearing from outside as eccentrically crafted windows fluttering with spidersilk curtains. Inside, branches have been trained or enticed to grow in astounding formation to create walls, a winding labyrinth with leaf-mould carpeting, a lofted green ceiling illuminated by dappled sunshine filtered through arbor canopy. Twisting branches ziggurating up into dim alcoves clearly function as stairs, bark oiled smooth by hands and feet of what surely must be a primate if not a human climber\u2014someone who doesn\u2019t wear shoes, with a grip surer and stronger than Charlie\u2019s hooked fingers and splintered wrists could manage on their best days. Her guide, in the incongruous outfit of an oldfashioned butler, is barefoot.\nBut an elephant does still exist in the world. She hears it before she sees it, a low-frequency rumble that sets the living walls quivering and resonates inside Charlie\u2019s jelly bones. The labyrinth\u2019s central chamber feels smaller than the entry hall of her parents\u2019 penthouse with its mirrors and metal and its netsuke display case spanning concrete. Her rigid fingers clutch at the small bulge in her square sleeve. The netsuke feels warm even through cloth. She extracts it and holds it in her palm, approaching the elephant with the lump of violated pachyderm like an offering, an apology, an acknowledgement of crimes so vast and inexplicable they only vaguely hover at the edges of Charlie\u2019s comprehension.\nElephants\u2014at least this elephant, an animal extinct more years than some species, fewer years than others, which shouldn\u2019t, can\u2019t, be here\u2014aren\u2019t as large as Charlie imagined. She steps close enough to count its eyelashes, to see bristlebrush hairs making a lie of the velvety appearance of rumpled skin. She sets the small carved ivory piece in the crook of its curled trunk. The elephant lifts the tiny carving lost in its folds of flesh, cradles it to its cheek with a low coo similar to how one might comfort a baby. Its tusks are small, maybe only a thousand netsukes-worth of ivory between the two including the invisible portions buried inside the animal\u2019s jaws, its skull and bones. Charlie\u2019s teeth hurt at the thought, and her heart.\nThe tuxedoed man\u2019s bare feet strike noiseless on trampled leaf carpet when he steps past her to accept the netsuke from the elephant. To Charlie, he says in his toothless whistle, \u201cThe carvers are waiting, yes, yes.\u201d\nThe elephant had drawn all Charlie\u2019s attention; for the first time she notices a silent row of humans crouched in shadowed recesses. People of different shades and ages and shapes, rendered similar by the elegant plainness of their simple clothes, the calmness of their collective gaze and the strange concave cheeks over their uniformly toothless gums. Beside them rises the only jarring human-made structure in the place: a curio display shelf, mirror, metal and glass, illuminated by a lone shaft of sunlight angling down through the branchy ceiling. Even from a distance Charlie sees miniature netsuke densely stacked and piled on the shelves by the hundreds, the thousands. Ignoring the usual stabbing pains in her ankle tendons and collapsing arches of her feet, she goes to the incredible display. The intricate carvings are proportioned like most common netsuke, like her parents\u2019 collection\u2026 but a fraction of the size, more eerily familiar than they have any right to seem. This primal familiarity is because, Charlie realizes, it\u2019s not elephant ivory. Not ivory from bison, walrus, narwhal. Not from wild boar. Not from any extinct creature.\nShe reaches to stroke one, a lifesized ant clutching a pea, with telltale netsuke cord holes on its underside. Smaller across than her fingernail, an astounding feat of dexterity, skill far past anything she\u2019d thought existed. Her parents would\u2019ve hunted the world for such carving. They would\u2019ve paid an artisan\u2019s lifetime salary for such a perfect piece. They would\u2019ve given their eyeteeth.\nThe elephant is patient while Charlie makes her way back to its side, watching her stiff-limbed progress with enormous lash-fringed dichromatic eyes. When she nears, it reaches its trunk out to support her the way Charlie imagines a real-life friend might support one with an arm behind the shoulders, if one ever made a friend in real life not filtered by screens and avatars and those invisible waves that might be anything or anyone or no-one at the other end. Charlie never has managed to make this sort of friend.\nThe elephant draws her close enough to steady herself on its tusk. Its living ivory feels warmer than her own skin, warmer than her own spit when she reaches into her mouth to tug the first tooth from its shabby mooring in her disintegrating jaw. Warmer than the smear of her own blood where she grips the animal\u2019s long pale extraordinary tooth, fighting vertigo accompanying her swimming vision, her head spinning with the first extraction.\nCharlie\u2019s barefoot guide holds a wide carved wooden bowl toward her, murmuring, \u201cYes\u2026 yes\u2026 \u201d in soothing tones. The bowl\u2019s clean and smooth, stained deep splotched rusty black from, she suspects, other visitors, other initiates, other invitees. She senses but does not feel compelled to define forces larger than this single event, this single room and her single feeling of relief when she tugs the second tooth from a jawbone as feeble and rotten as the rest of her infrastructure, as willing to collapse into dust and nothing. She knows some things are unknowable. And then there are those other things. Things like crimes and disappointments and griefs so vast and inexplicable they only vaguely hover at the edges of her comprehension.\nWith the first sense of rightness Charlie has ever felt from her traitorous body, the first sense of harmony, she prods and rocks the next tooth back and forth, back and forth, watching from her peripheral vision the carvers approach, seeing that the tools they grip in their powerful dexterous strong-boned artisan grasps might be good not only for polishing and carving human teeth, but for harvesting. Catching the elephant\u2019s soft brown gaze she slumps into the warm supportive cradle of its trunk, and opens her mouth wide for the approaching carvers, and tilts her head back as far as her unspooling vertebrae allow.\nBut that\u2019s only the end of her first act.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAct II\nLeft to herself, Charlie would prefer to never meet face to face the residents in the towers, the bankers and doctors and lawyers and clerks and executives and programmers and investors and consumers and all other persons of import and consequence or even mere social compliance who make up the citizenry of their automated world. It is a utopia, this world. It is perfect. Just ask anyone who lives here, rather than in the places on other continents that have been ground up in the machine of technological advancement, stripped of minerals and water and arable topsoil and anything else useable as fuel or raw material or wealth. The only thing left really is city, and beyond that, the mutating jungle spurred by off-gassed waste and by immeasurable energy pollution shed by the advanced technologies of the era, electricity and microwaves and gamma rays and rapid particles and particle manipulators and particle accelerators and particle destroyers. Environmental tipping points were reached well before Charlie was born, and for the last decade or more, beyond the new jungles and the old silent algaed oceans lie continents of only sparsely and tenuously populated desert.\nThe crew\u2019s lead chimp gives the sign to the rest of the group: two fingers jabbing westward and a feral grimace. Charlie and the others follow his command, surging amoebalike toward a windowless building. She has long since cast off her city trappings, shoes and clothes and fear, and now daily drinks tart vegetal sludge the elephant\u2019s herbalists and alchemists distill from the jungle, adaptive cellulose binding agents and curative properties of self-repairing plant DNA that enable Charlie\u2019s bones to strengthen and solidify. Her skeletal frame will never be straight\u2014her body is as it is, bones curved and crunched, spine slightly twisted, limbs too long or too short for \u201chuman\u201d perambulation. But Charlie doesn\u2019t care what other humans think she should look like. If anything, now the pain is manageable and her bones no longer feel in danger of shattering, her tilted posture and tendency toward a crouched stance make her feel at ease with her mixed primate crew. Bonobo, chimpanzee, the occasional orangutan break-in specialist or gorilla muscle who usually make up her fellow special operatives\u2014they\u2019ve never communicated to Charlie that they find her lacking. Her fingers are the most dexterous, after all, and her past experience with city living is a definite advantage to the team. She, like the rest, has her special talents.\nTonight\u2019s mission is similar to every other: the disruption of rapacious human endeavor. They\u2019ve been sent to remove key programming nodes from an energy redistribution plant, a low-security substation with the misfortune to exist in a crucial hub location. The elephant has indicated that tonight\u2019s operation will cause a third of the city\u2019s distant production facilities to go dark. It\u2019ll be temporary\u2014little more than a nuisance to automated urban maintenance, really\u2014but will grant the elephant\u2019s resistance faction breathing space to set up other sabotage operations with larger consequences. Charlie neither knows nor cares what those consequences might be; she follows the elephant, and the elephant, or more accurately the act of following the elephant, sets her free.\nCharlie\u2019s crew has more opposable thumbs at their disposal than most, but hers are the most opposable, the best adapted to human design. She enters codes the elephant\u2019s hackers provided, and the exterior substation door whisks open. She doesn\u2019t know it yet but in a very few minutes she and her crew will encounter a human watchman. He will be surprised, and afraid, and in his surprise and fear will strike one of her colleagues with his electrical stunning baton and kill the small bonobo dead. Charlie will be swift and stab him through the heart with a blade made from sharpened human femur, and he will bleed red viscous human guts into the sterile white corridor not designed for living traffic. One of the primate operatives will sling their fallen comrade over her shoulder and the crew will complete their objective and melt, amoebalike, back into the outside nighttime shadows. Charlie will leave imperfect irregular human footprints in the watchman\u2019s blood, but won\u2019t notice or care. Returning to the ruffled green growth shoving back the edge of the city, the chimps and remaining bonobos and the capuchin and macaque will beat their chests and bare their hard ivory teeth in defiance of the rectangular concrete landscape they travel through. Their teeth are intact, strong and clean as nature made them, untainted by the millennia of rapine which vibrates through the human ivory littering the elephant\u2019s shelves. They gnash and screech, the lone human primate in their crew fiercely joyous to spill human blood that night on their collective behalf. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d she growls in ferocious sibilant whispers alongside their howls and hoots, baring empty pink gums unable to grind meat even if she wanted. \u201cYes, yes! Yes!\u201d\nThis will be the tenor of Charlie\u2019s days and nights for a long time, through much of the middle of her story.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAct III\nIn the language of her community, the sign\/sound combination for the word priestess also implies teacher. She lopes slow but confident down the path toward her classroom, a wide clearing with tumbled stones to perch on and the ruins of an enormous tiled fountain at its center. Water ripples in the fountain, tinted pale purple by new generations of restorative algae which have been gaining strength in standing ponds and pools of still water since the human city fell. The elephant\u2019s scientists still work with the jungle to reclaim cubic millimeter by cubic millimeter the organic world from its devastated state. It\u2019s a slow process, but no one is in any special hurry\u2014why would they be?\nAs Charlie nears the clearing, several of her pupils emerge from the jungle to join her. She\u2019s not supposed to have favorites and so pretends not to. But these are certainly some of her brightest, her gentlest, her most inquisitive students. A small human child walking fully upright on only two limbs, the way Charlie was taught as a baby, shyly falls into a bowlegged lope beside her. His chimpanzee playmate makes a humorous face at the boy\u2019s efforts and the two break off to roll and cuff each other in typical friendship dominance play. Charlie and the others ignore the pair and continue to the fountain.\nDay and sky are clear. Charlie joins the ritual dance her students improvise, homage to their elephant founder who set their parents and grandparents and sometimes great or multi-greats grandparents free. The rituals and homages change class to class, season to season, often involve petting and inquisitive strokes of the great yellowing tusks resting in the carved wooden cradle under the impermanent shelter Charlie and her students build each year or season as part of their instruction. Already the dead elephant\u2019s enormous distinctive ivories are wearing thin in spots, the thousand touches of tiny primate fingers faster acting than some erosions, slower than others. Charlie, their priestess\/teacher, doesn\u2019t preach\/teach them to fetishize the dead elephant\u2019s teeth. The world has already seen that season and barely survived. She\u2019s happy to watch the last of the elephant\u2019s teeth disappear along with the last of her own generation, who extracted the ivory from their jaws in their Demanding season, their Fierce one.\nThese days all her seasons feel Contemplative. Thought of being At Rest doesn\u2019t frighten or repel Charlie. She turns her attention to her day\u2019s flock of students, proud of their strong teeth. She feels their Waking season gathering as it nears, the way clouds thicken with rain to wash everything fresh and green and new, heavy with what might be, what will.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue31\/3lbe31_story1.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"Charlie is an orphan.

She was wearing the lanyard bracelet I made her, the one that earned me a blush all her own. For a moment it was like the movies, the branches rustling in the warm breeze, the sweet-metal smell of our stolen Cokes \u2014 if I ignored the surgical marker dotted down her sternum, an unerring path to the heart.\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d griped Abigail, babying the flame she\u2019d coaxed from a contraband lighter and a demolished Seventeen magazine. My bunkmate was exceptionally good at building fires. She used to be exceptionally good at everything \u2014 Girl Scouts, debate, algebra \u2014 except being thin. Now she prodded the ashes with an arm that had barely enough muscle left to do it.\n\u201cTechnically, we\u2019re all late.\u201d Abigail flipped me the finger, skinny as a popsicle stick.\nIt sounded like a sweet deal, right? After you died, you went to summer camp. Camp Killowee (\u201cWhere Young Ladies Are Made!\u201d) had a tennis court, a rock wall, and a canteen with an old-school soda fountain. It had a lake, flat and glistening as a sick child\u2019s forehead. It had a float called The Blob, which looked like a badly taxidermized jellyfish and made hoarse throbbing wails in the wind.\nIt had the infirmary, with the sign over the door that read Be the Best Version of Yourself.\nSummer was endless taffy, the days stretched out and stuck to the back of your teeth. Counselors taught us to dab our lips after meals, to purse them around embroidery thread, to smack them after applying gloss. They led smiling practice before bed until our mouths ached and split. If we complained, they reminded us that we could go home only when our treatments were finished, when we were perfect.\nBut in the woods, nobody had to smile except the shadows, which made slow, rippling grins across the lake. We tore the guts out of marshmallows and licked smeared fingers clean. We traded dirty jokes until flashlights winked on in the distance, sending us scattering back to our cabins; back to the furious, sweltering confines of girlhood, or whatever it was in the dark.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMy first time in the camp infirmary, beneath the fluorescent lights and the doctor\u2019s expectant stare, I felt myself swell, the worst parts of me bulbous, ballooned. It was the Easter dress all over again. I was a lung filled with water. I was the way words like buxom and woman sounded on my tongue. The doctor frowned.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want to be pretty, Isabela?\u201d he asked, meaning Don\u2019t you want to be normal?\nThe nurses rushed parts up from storage \u2014 ballerinas\u2019 slender calves, starlets\u2019 demure lips \u2014 but my body rejected them all, flexing like a snapped electric wire in a storm.\nThe doctors tried everything: experimental glues, catalogs\u2019 worth of eyelashes and ears, the pearlescent French manicure of a former hand model, shipped in from Europe. Nothing stuck. Not until I kissed Mariah under the lakeside bleachers and her lip gloss clung to my chin, and Texas Tammi from Cabin 7 saw it and snitched on us, because I was a wrong thing in a camp full of wrong things.\nNineteen states had outlawed internal replacements. This was not one of them.\nThe next week, Mariah told me they were taking her heart.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMariah looked away. I peered at my co-conspirators. At Yulissa\u2019s hearing aids. At Tonya, whose adoptive parents had expected her skin to be lighter. At Courtney, so young no one dared to ask how she died; she never spoke, just jammed her stick straight into the coals.\nMaybe that\u2019s what gave me the idea.\nMaybe I just had to get creative, with no gators around.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhen Camp Killowee closed indefinitely, the locals had their theories: the lanyard cord melted around the exit door handles, the tampon jammed into the creaky firetrap of a fuse box, the pickup truck abandoned across state lines. But the first responders refused to describe for the press exactly what they found inside, and they didn\u2019t mean the blackened lawn ornaments.\nThey meant how careful our stitches were, how neat and ladylike.\nWe asked the doctors and nurses, you know, as we plied our needles. Fair\u2019s fair. We even matched the colors of lipstick tubes and cream blushes to the skin we sewed shut around them. When the flames smeared upward, a million shades of Pop-Your-Cherry-Red and Luscious Lemon and Babydoll Pink and Pucker-Up Pink and, as it turned out, open-mouthed, fleshy, Yowling Pink, we asked them:\nDon\u2019t you want to be pretty?\nBut we forgot their answers as soon as we peeled out of the lot, our faces hideous with soot and tears and snot, and barreled whooping down the road and toward the moon \u2014 an imperfect gibbous, raw and fat as a marshmallow in the midnight\u2019s laughing mouth.\n\u2022\nFront & Back cover art by Rew X\n\u2022\nJulie Ireland\nBear Weiter\nCraig Church\nKelly L.\nJessica Guptill\nThomas Ha\nMaria Haskins\nLorna D.

There is no shame in it. Till\u2019s mantle, her flesh, keeps the hot dark at bay, but this woman, by some lucky grace, can\u2019t see that. She only sees skin, and what Till can do to it.\nThis woman is no mother, sister, aunt, cousin, friend; whoever, or whatever, they might be. Counselor. Because of course the best person to counsel what\u2019s inside is someone who\u2019s never had it. Till hasn\u2019t succeeded enough on the Richter scale to warrant a full-blown state of emergency. Everyone knew that if Till was serious about it, the continental drift would fracture vertically, not horizontally.\nJust like some people can read lips or body language, Till reads hands. Doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re writing upside down, one hundred words per minute on a keyboard, shorthand, or shielded.\nOr PIN numbers.\nThe counselor writes: attention seeking behavior.\nTill\u2019s inner core, the one they conveniently forget is as hot as the sun, shifts.\nThere is so much gold in me, I could cover the entire surface of the world one and half feet thick. You know I could.\nToo early, Till thinks at it. Slow down, I need you. The mantle has barely had time to heal.\nThe counselor watches as Till presses the fingers of her free hand, the right, the weak one, against the ridge of flesh. She says something, anything really, but what she writes is all that matters.\nThose words are lies which will never be uttered to Till\u2019s face.\nThe dark burns against Till\u2019s gullet, pushes against the still fragile and cooling lithosphere, against the base of her spine, her skull. Show them, it whispers. Show them the metal you\u2019re really made of.\nNo. Till doesn\u2019t push or squirm or sweat. The dark has been doing these things for so long she\u2019s learned to smother, cool the lava with a shock of water until it crackles, knits, waits. No one notices how practiced and neat the fault lines are; just wide enough for the dark to squeeze out, but never enough to deprive the dark of its host. Till has to remain intact.\nDespite it all: the acrid tongue that spoils all food for her; the cystic skin working overtime to maintain the mantle\u2019s integrity; the I-hurt-no-one-but-myself and I\u2019m-different-from-others, and can\u2019t-you-hear-how-selfish-that-is.\nIn spite of it all, Till respects and admires the peaks and troughs of her skin. They are the relief patterns. Such landscape. Wild territory.\nThe counselor is staring at Till. She has asked a question and too much time has gone by.\nTill\u2019s neck itches.\nShe smoothes her forearm and neck, reading the ridges, the pulse, the undulation and intersection of fault lines. That\u2019s not very clever, she whispers.\nWhat\u2019s not clever, the counselor asks. Her full moon eyes push against Till\u2019s skin; she thinks her gravity has some effect.\nAren\u2019t you tired of being clever? Let go, just for a moment.\nTill knows she should say no, but already she searches the room for something sharp. Of course they wouldn\u2019t be so stupid.\nThe pen perhaps, or the counselor\u2019s glasses. But they wouldn\u2019t leave the right incision, and Till is, if anything, picky. All fractures of the mantle make a pattern if one looks close enough. Because it\u2019s pretty, she said once, and only once.\nBecause if you\u2019re going to do it, do it right.\nWhatever they pump into Till\u2019s body, the dark swallows it whole for her and laughs in the face of such foolishness. It makes me stronger, not weaker.\nA picture frame? The fire alarm? A window?\nNo.\nThey underestimate the power of fingers.\nMagma pulses just below the surface, reaching out, making the connection. Nails on throat.\nAt first there\u2019s blood. And the relief. Oh, the relief! The pressure drains from her skull and arms as the blood shields her chest, but leaves nothing of the weakness.\nThen shimmering with oily rainbows, exultantly elastic, the dark comes.\nThe rip is skilful and not deep enough to cause damage to her larynx, major arteries, or esophagus. Just deep and wide enough for the bulb of plastic-like liquid to squeeze out, a parasite freed from its nest of flesh.\nThe counselor has already hit the panic button, is reaching for the gash on Till\u2019s throat, so these few seconds are precious.\nBut oh, these few seconds.\nIt is just a drop.\nThe shiny, silky morass leaps the small gap between them and slides across the parched landscape of the counselor\u2019s hand. It quivers, as if fearful of the exposed air, then excavates into the greedy, sucking pores.\nHer body quakes once. Sadness infects the counselor\u2019s smile.\nYou understand now, says Till.\nTill\u2019s mantle crusts over with practiced ease, the dark licking the flesh healed to Till\u2019s specifications. This should leave a nice scar. An interesting one.\nThe door rumbles with pummeling fists, shouts.\nTime to be clever again.\nThe counselor opens the security window, then gives Till her wallet and a clean handkerchief. She places her newly stone strong hand over Till\u2019s. Already her skin is too warm. She checks the wound, looks deep into Till\u2019s eyes, nods. A problem shared is a problem halved, Till imagines her saying.\nIf only.\nIt\u2019s only a short drop to the ground.\nGo, be free.\nThere\u2019s always more where that came from.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue30\/3lbe30_story6.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"Till runs her fingers across the angry ridge of skin on her wrist, the latest mountain range to erupt from the fault lines of her veins.

His head is wet, but that is expected. I might not have absorbed the impact, but he did. They all do when they try to force pain onto me. My hand comes away from his skull, a black red in the dim light.\n\u201cI can help you,\u201d I say. \u201cMake you like me completely. Take the longing for life and fulfill it, and you will never, never know sorrow the way you do now, the way it clings to your bones, drips into your veins, and burns through your skin.\u201d\nHe looks at me, hand on my arm, already broken, already mine, already too far gone to ease the aching swell spreading through my bones.\nIt takes but a moment for me to see his past, and then I can\u2019t ease anything of his, not even to keep my sisters safe. I turn him loose into the sea, where his lungs will be filled yet. I stand there sorry, still yearning for him to fill me. It is then I begin to bleed.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nOh, Lilith, what you\u2019ve brought upon us.\nIt wasn\u2019t so long ago men heard the stories of how we clawed them open and wrote the stories of their desecration on their loins. They knew to fear us, felt the possibilities of blood from a single, forbidden touch and knew not to take what wasn\u2019t theirs.\nWhen the first man shot off my mother\u2019s wings and brought her to the ground, we hid, and instead turned our will to vengeance into redemption. They wouldn\u2019t know us, wouldn\u2019t even know themselves after we were through. We would take it from them and bring it into ourselves. Stronger. And lasting forever. If we would only do this one thing. But they would never remember what they\u2019d done, and what the twisted would continue to do. Never be made to atone.\nThey forgot to fear us. Such is the way secrets die. They lie rotting in boxes while the living breathe no hint of their power. And, wilting, our secrets trembled beneath a sunless sky until they too lost their power, and in turn, ours.\nIn the grace of dawn, my mother and her sisters came for me. Ripped off my claws and plucked me free of my wings. I was twelve when they took the day and replaced it for night.\n\u201cThe blindness will not last,\u201d my mother said. \u201cBut you will come to need it, Cerese, to take comfort in it.\u201d\nEven so, respite comes only for a moment, for I always grow \u2014 ever full, every longing.\nNow that I\u2019ve given him to the sea, I can\u2019t turn back. While the sea takes him, my lungs burn for oxygen \u2014 a fire that spits and rips with each sputtering breath.\n\u201cCan you take me?\u201d I whisper, but the sea refuses to answer. I should know its response by now, I\u2019ve asked so many times.\nSo I\u2019m left to wander, having sacrificed my own sacrifice for life.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThey\u2019ll check me for wings, for the lice of love, to be sure I haven\u2019t sacrificed for the right reasons. All to confirm there\u2019s still power left in these too-human bones.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMy grandmother eyes my body, still half-naked from my botched encounter. My flesh all prickled \u2014 feathers threatening to extend again.\n\u201cYou got to fix that,\u201d Grandmother says quietly, fingers brushing along my back. I wince.\nThey have no right to touch me while I still bleed for him. But they do, their power as hard and strong as his body might have been. Once I\u2019d made him part of me. How I wish I hadn\u2019t seen, how I wish we didn\u2019t always see the twists and turns of sickness.\n\u201cDon\u2019t make it so impossible, Cerese. Look at you now.\u201d My grandmother refuses to let go.\n\u201cIs this your dream?\u201d I want to ask, to spit my broken wings at their feet, to rip my ruptured organs out of my body and feed them the long, slow beats of pain.\nBut I don\u2019t. I watch my mother\u2019s gaze still fixed on the sea, and let my grandmother brush my mottled flesh.\nI know they feel the same pain.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWe skim from the land, take from the deadbeat, brooding crop of the tangled and confused, merge with them and offer new life in the form of our flesh. That is their redemption, though we once did it otherwise. How we made them pay, made them hear the screams from their nightmares, and carved our names into their chests.\nToday, we take them, and a few, a very lucky few, we pick to carry on our line. But so often these days the children come out mangled, corrupted by the history of our flesh. There\u2019s always a price.\nSometimes, though, we find women who know our true names. They wish for us, praying in their sleep that we were sent to ease the strain of life. But so much fear becomes a wall and the passage through hardly bearable. I know I must find the woman I saw in Donovan, though, before this blood is all I\u2019ll ever have, all I can ever be. I want to be free.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nCora was his sister, curly red hair and a breezy laugh, always in the sun. Donovan clung to the shadows, pressed against the walls while Cora flowed through the grass, turned cartwheels, and rolled down the long hill above the bay beside their house.\nShe would drop to the ground and his insides would grow hot. He\u2019d caress himself, pretending it was her instead.\nAnd one day, she rolled down the hill and he followed, insides burning, a voice inside saying yes, do it, it\u2019s what she wants. And he did, watched her cry, and touched her hair and said it was okay, that it was natural and they would always have each other.\n\u201cI will always be there for you,\u201d he said.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nTheir mother didn\u2019t know, couldn\u2019t understand why her brilliant baby began to wet the bed again at twelve and screamed and sobbed if she tried to leave them alone, even for an hour or two.\nFor Donovan\u2019s part, he left her alone, that afternoon bottled tight inside. He licked his lips and caressed the memory of Cora in the sun. Now that she shrank from the light, she drew him no longer. He needed those moments in the bright to keep him out of the dark.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nShe calls for me now. She knows I gave him to the sea.\n\u201cCan you take me?\u201d she whispers, like I did, but I already have something more in mind.\nShe can be in the sunlight again, the way I stay clinging to the dark.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nShe doesn\u2019t have to remind me. I\u2019m still bleeding.\nEvery man we take, we keep something. Because I let him go, I have a scar, a jagged edge that rips at my insides. Cora waits for me to stitch her up, to swallow the sticky pain whole and gift her with my wings. It\u2019s not so simple.\nI find her finally, scrubbing stains from a bar counter with a dirty rag. I could laugh but the obvious grief is too much. She\u2019s made it so easy, but still the sorrow lays heavy.\nWhy didn\u2019t we take her all those years before? It\u2019s our power, it\u2019s within our rights, but we left her to be broken. Maybe we didn\u2019t know. So much blindness.\nI sigh and sit at the bar, pleather stool creaking. I don\u2019t look like a savior. I don\u2019t look like anything but a scrawny, bird-like woman whose neck sticks out too far. My fingernails slope in a predatorial curve \u2014 and my shoulders \u2014 let\u2019s not talk about my shoulders.\nHer hair frizzes in the heat and a sheen of sweat cakes her tank top.\nIt\u2019s this Gulf air that makes us all crazy.\nShe pushes a glass at me, sloshing amber on the gummy surface she\u2019s cleaned at least ten times today.\n\u201cI know who you are,\u201d she says.\nWhen I say nothing Cora glares and dabs at the puddle between us.\n\u201cI\u2019m not crazy. You were in my dream. You said you would come, and hey, what do you know, here you are. It\u2019d be a first, you sticking to your word.\u201d\nI raise my glass and take a drink. She throws the soiled rag on the floor and walks away. She\u2019s giving a show, but she\u2019ll come back. I start counting until she does.\nIt would be too much for either of us to say, \u201cI need you.\u201d It violates the line we cannot cross, a wall of crumbling stone and moss, destined to give way to the sea. All the pressure of holding on.\nThe liquid burns my throat and I choke, spit it on the bar. She shoves a feather into my hand.\n\u201cClean it up yourself.\u201d She disappears again, into the back. Like that, she\u2019s gone. I drop blood onto the creaking stool, trail it behind me out the door and around back, where she leans against a wall and smokes.\nI think of her fifteen years earlier, laughing curls shining as she tumbles down the hill. If only we\u2019d plucked him then.\nShe exhales a coal black cloud. For a moment, I feel the blindness and reach for her with my bloodied hand.\nShe sidesteps me. \u201cWhat makes you think I even want your help? Look at you \u2014 you\u2019re totally stuck too. Nothing you do helps anyone. Little lonely lost.\u201d\nBut her smoke fills my lungs. It is then I sprout my wings \u2014 the dangerous, killing wings \u2014 and we fly.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nCora\u2019s heat, her hands gripping my wound. We\u2019re both so bloody beneath this black sky.\n\u201cThis is where I let him go.\u201d\nShe dips her toe into the murk, our reflections lost.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not gone. You know that.\u201d She points at my dripping side.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t it hurt? Mine still does.\u201d She lifts her shirt and shows me where he cut her, trying to hold her down.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t as deep as yours, you know. And he doctored it up after, so mom never knew. But it still hurts. Never goes away.\u201d\n\u201cIt can,\u201d I say, simply, a whisper that cracks over the crashing waves.\n\u201cYou know I don\u2019t believe you. Some fairy godmother you turned out to be.\u201d\nI pull her to me and hold her, even though my side aches. Her memory burns it like salt.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not who we are, that\u2019s not what we do,\u201d I whisper into her ear.\nShe turns and kisses me, the first time anyone\u2019s ever done it voluntarily. I flinch but she holds her hand over my wound and says, \u201cIt hurts less when we do it this way.\u201d\nIn that moment, we are both blind again, back at the beginning. But when she stops, the stars in the sky burn me like acid.\nMy stomach swells with pooling blood, my body unable to contain the damage any longer. I guide her hand to the wound again and together our fingers curl inside, reaching for the escaping heat, an orb of us that\u2019s taken its own form. Once we pull it out, I lift it up, and we lose the blindness.\nIn the glow of its light, she sees herself, young and old, new and already dying, alone, afraid and hidden from the sun. But then we turn the orb around and there\u2019s me, wings and all, skimming along the ocean, my mother calling behind me, afraid to beat her wings and be shot down again.\nThis is our possibility, everything we\u2019ve ever been and will never be.\n\u201cTouch it,\u201d I tell her, \u201cand we\u2019ll reset the clock.\u201d\nFingers trembling, she brushes the day it happened, the day we both lost our wings.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThen she turns. Her brother still stands there, feather on his upturned palm. He crushes it when she asks to see it. All at once he begins to cry.\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d she says, and picks the feather up from the ground. \u201cIf you cry, the gulls will hear. They don\u2019t like salt water, you know.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s stupid,\u201d her brother says, face red. \u201cThey live off the ocean, dummy. You think they don\u2019t like salt? I heard they\u2019ll eat anything in the ocean if it moves. Wanna bet?\u201d\nHe steps toward her and she stops smiling.\n\u201cNo, Donovan, leave me alone. I meant they don\u2019t live in the ocean is all.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re still gonna see what they like. You think they\u2019ll rescue you? Or eat you? Let\u2019s see.\u201d\nHe grabs her wrist and she pulls, pulls so hard it feels like her hand will come off, and finally, when she\u2019s tugging as hard as she can, tears streaming, he lets her go, and she\u2019s loose, but flying, flying, tumbling backward off the hill and into the bay.\nThe water hits her, so cold and blinding and never ending. She falls so far, so deep, without breath, without anything but darkness and that stupid feather still clutched in her other hand.\nAnd Donovan? Donovan? Where is he? She falls so, so far.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nShe\u2019ll come back, she has to, he thinks, and just before he crashes into the rocks, he sees another gull, too big to be real, rising from the sea and swirling toward the sky.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHer red hair swirls as her fingers close on my shoulders. I could let her go, shake her off and let my mother clip my wings, but I won\u2019t. This is my future and her past and we are one.\nCora\u2019s hands shine against my scars. This water, this heavy near death that binds us, lifts us up. My wings close around us until we break the surface.\nI see Donovan against the rocks, the real scars where they belong. Cora doesn\u2019t see, doesn\u2019t know him in her new body. Together, we lift from the surface and rise into the sky.\nI am her mother, and she is mine. Her red wings will shine forever in the sun and no one, no one will drown us in the blood of sorrow. We will not hide from what we are. And they will know to fear us once more.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue30\/3lbe30_story5.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"Bird-clawed and bony, we tread lightly in the shadows, accustomed to the dark.

His life still feels stuck around such a moment. He looks down at the path again, and is hit by the scent of pennies, but does not know if it is spilt blood or spilt money he is remembering.\nThe caves have changed since he was a child. Now many colors of bulbs highlight the stone wonders on either side of the walkway, where before there was only darkness and a fading torch. He touches the hardhat loaned to him by the attraction, and finds a safety sticker peeling away from the rim. He plays with the edge as he sits again on the damp floor.\nHis Father had been a few steps in front of him, letting Dave take the steep descent at his own pace, so he never saw what caused his Father to lose his footing. Didn\u2019t see why he fell so far and broke so certainly. The stairs are now lit with industrial-looking lamps laced with safety cages. He reaches out to one and flinches at the heat.\nA family pushes past him on their way to the main caves, sparing him a look of hesitancy. He stands aside as another group passes and desperately wants to follow them deeper into the attraction, but he cannot manage to leave this spot. Same as it ever was.\nThe staff must have seen him on the CCTV and one of them descends to check on him. There were no cameras the last time he visited. He closes his eyes and listens to the footsteps echo off the raw stone walls. The woman introduces herself as Anna.\n\u201cAre you OK?\u201d\n\u201cI want to go on further, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWe often get visitors who underestimate how steep the steps are, or underestimate their claustrophobia. It\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not scared. I just can\u2019t get past this point.\u201d\n\u201cI can accompany you, if you want.\u201d\nShe is in her fifties, and he wonders if she worked at the caves at the time of the accident. If she was the assistant who sat with him when they eventually realized what had happened. Who wrapped a blanket around his shoulders, as the emergency team shuffled by with ropes and carabiners. Her radio crackles and she inclines her head away from Dave. He knows what they are saying about him.\n\u201cWould you like to sit down?\u201d she asks, and he shakes his head to stop himself saying that of course he doesn\u2019t want to spend a single fucking minute more there, even as he can\u2019t move.\n\u201cOur director is on her way down.\u201d She bows her head, hands clasped around the radio as if in prayer or mourning.\nThey do not speak and the silence is only broken by further footsteps down the concrete.\nThe director is a similar age to Anna.\n\u201cI\u2019m Sue Clairbould. I\u2019m led to believe that you are David Stavehand?\u201d\nDave nods. The copper smell is back, though he does not know if it is a memory or some mineral in the water slicking the walls. Maybe his Father\u2019s blood is still in the dirt beneath his feet.\n\u201cIf you\u2019d let us know you were visiting we\u2019d have been happy to accommodate you.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t know how they could have accommodated him.\n\u201cI just want to get past this point,\u201d he says and points to the ground.\nBoth Sue and Anna look uncertain what to say for a moment.\n\u201cI want to see the well,\u201d he says. \u201cI just want to see the well.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAs he sat by his father\u2019s body, Dave had wondered if he\u2019d regretted not seeing the well once more. After all these years he still wants to see it for him. Keep a promise he made in the dark.\n\u201cWe can arrange for someone to go with you,\u201d Sue says. She looks at Anna for a moment as if expecting her to speak and when she doesn\u2019t, Sue continues \u201cWe\u2019re a bit short-staffed today. It would be better if you could visit again tomorrow. Free admission, obviously.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m staying in a guesthouse nearby,\u201d he says.\n\u201cCome just before we open,\u201d Sue says. \u201cThen you don\u2019t have to deal with any of the school parties.\u201d\nHe nods and starts to follow Anna up the stairs, Sue behind him. His safety helmet catches on the roof and he flinches.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a bit taller than when you were last here,\u201d Anna says, and he doesn\u2019t know how to respond.\n\u201cYour Mum came from around here,\u201d Sue says, changing the subject.\n\u201cShe grew up in the next Dale over,\u201d Dave says. \u201cBy the time I came along my parents had moved to the city.\u201d He feels the pressure of all the land around him. So close and so dense and so heavy with abandoned family expectations. When they reach the top and step out into the gift shop he walks past the large basket of safety helmets, shakes his head, and returns to remove the one on his head. The room is filled with displays of keychains, ornaments, T-shirts and hoodies, nylon witch hats, LED wands, postcards, tea mugs, slim binding books by local writers, and more.\n\u201cTomorrow then,\u201d he says.\n\u201cCome to my office first thing.\u201d Sue takes the helmet from him and drops it into the wicker basket with the others. \u201cIf I\u2019m not there, I won\u2019t be long.\u201d\nBack in his hotel room, he sits on the bed with mementos spread around him; the ticket stubs and brochure from that day, and the program of service from his Father\u2019s funeral. He folds them together, and slides them into his jacket pocket, preparing for tomorrow and hiding them from himself. The grief is more than paper. Grief is shattered bone stretching bloodstained denim, and the coughing gulps of breath through rib punctured lungs. The ebb with no flow.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cCome in,\u201d Sue shouts, and he goes inside. The office is small, the floor stacked with boxes of publicity leaflets. Sue sits behind the desk, the monitor\u2019s glow reflected in her glasses turning her eyes pale.\n\u201cAh, morning Mr. Stavehand.\u201d\n\u201cDave, please,\u201d he says with a rehearsed informality.\n\u201cMorning, Dave,\u201d she says, smiling as if his permission has lifted some huge weight from her shoulders. \u201cIf you can just give me a moment to finish up here. Payroll. Has to be done or there will be a mutiny,\u201d she says by way of explanation. \u201cPlease, take a seat.\u201d\nHe spots the only other chair in the room piled with books. Without asking, he lifts them and sits down. Because this place owes him something, perhaps because he cannot speak.\nFor ten minutes he sits in silence, amid the click of keyboard and an occasional sigh from Sue Clairbould as she pauses then deletes.\nWhen he was a child, the room had been a small kitchen, he recalled now, and how he sat in silence as they lifted his Father up the stairs and into the quiet dark ambulance with no hope of resuscitation. He remembers the sound of the paramedics slipping, the body escaping them to fall again. He still doesn\u2019t know if his Father was dead by then, or the contact with the tile floor had ended his life.\nHe picks up a leaflet and unfolds it on his lap. Between colorful professional photos of the caverns the text tells folklore of the place, how women who fell pregnant out of wedlock would be pressured to leave their offspring near the cave entrance to placate the witches who dwelled below ground. Even when he was a boy he hadn\u2019t believe such stories, it was just gruesome old fashioned infanticide.\n\u201cRight!\u201d Sue says with a finality that is too close to his own memories. She stands and extends a hand, not to shake but for him to go first through the door. He does, and holds it open until she follows then lets her take the lead to the cave entrance.\n\u201cIf you wouldn\u2019t mind putting on a safety helmet. Even outside hours, safety first.\u201d She smiles and hands him a blue helmet. It is not the same as the one he wore the day before, and the foam band within smells of someone else\u2019s sweat. Sue glances down at his feet.\n\u201cSturdy boots. No need to lend you some wellies.\u201d\nHis boots are stained with cave water from yesterday. He remembers the loaned rubber boots bulging from one of his father\u2019s many fractures, blood from torn skin seeping from the top, soaked up by the gravel. He can smell pennies again and shakes his head.\nSue puts a hand on his arm and looks directly into his eyes. Dave finds it disconcerting the way he can see his reflection in her glasses.\n\u201cIf it gets too much and you need a break, just let me know and we can stop.\u201d He nods, and begins to speak, but she continues. \u201cYou can always return another a time if you become overwhelmed.\u201d\nDave shakes his head and smiles. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting a long time for this.\u201d\nShe walks in front of him, steadying herself on the iron railing that curves down into the earth. Her hand reaches out and flicks a switch bringing light to the underworld. He wonders if the staff ever enter the caves alone. If they ever venture in after hours. If they ever smell pennies in the air.\nShe ducks under the concrete lintel and he follows close behind. With the angle of the stairs, her head is level with his sturdy boots, and the thought forms in his mind. He considers overwriting his Father\u2019s death with another. To tumble this woman who is little more than a symbol of the place. Her death means nothing to him, and so he hesitates and does not murder. Does not add more pennies to the air.\nHalfway down the flight of stairs she pauses and turns to check on him.\n\u201cAnd your Mum is Jackie Keld?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Dave says, steadying himself, though his imbalance is all the memories weighing him down.\n\u201cWe went to the same school, but I was a couple of years above her. Saw her growing up. Quiet thing.\u201d\nDave lets the conversation die. He does not want to talk about his Mother. Doesn\u2019t want to remember her grief on top of his own. How she always blamed herself for that first date. They continue into the earth.\nWhen they reach the spot where he stopped yesterday, he halts again, trapped again by one hundred steps above him and one hundred steps below. He stands on the pivot step and closes his eyes for a moment. Still the air is coppery and sharp.\n\u201cAre you OK?\u201d Sue Clairbould has stopped and regards him. He does not know which step his Father fell from, whether it was step one-hundred-one, or step forty-three, or step ninety-two. All of them contributed to the breaking of him. Sue takes her hand off the rail and that thought is there again. He lets it pass.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. I mean, I\u2019m not\u2014but I can cope.\u201d\nShe nods as if the matter is settled.\nHe continues following her down, the odor of blood intensifying as if he is still wearing the clothes of that day.\n\u201cWe were all surprised when your Mum left to be honest, but everyone who goes has their reasons.\u201d\n\u201cThey wanted something new, I think.\u201d\n\u201cDid they find the new?\u201d\n\u201cThey had me,\u201d he says for want of another answer. He is an outsider in the countryside, almost as much as his Father had been when he met his Mother in the nearby cycling caf\u00e9. His Father had an outsider\u2019s love for the land. His Mother had roots in the peat and veins running with tarn water.\nThey reach a level length of cave floor and Dave stumbles, trying not to stand on the spot where his Father died and he himself was changed. His hand reaches out to the cave wall to steady himself and comes away slick with cold water filtered through sky and earth. His descent is filtered between memories and loss, and he pauses to collect himself.\n\u201cAre you ready to go on, or do you need a moment?\u201d Sue says. She tips her head back so he can see her concerned look beneath her hardhat. There is something else there too. Pleasure at his discomfort? He suspects she likes to see people in distress so she can help them and linger in the warm feeling of generosity it creates within.\nDave takes a deep breath and glances at the gritted path beneath his feet to mark how far he has come. \u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d he says. He lifts his foot and places it beyond his Father\u2019s death and his world takes a new shape.\nThey walk in silence down the first tunnel. The walls are closer now. He feels their weight again.\n\u201cI\u2019ve loved this place for a long time,\u201d Sue says, though he suspects she does not love the quiet. \u201cThey first brought us down here when we were young. About the age you were the first time. Your Mother too.\u201d\n\u201cWith school,\u201d he says, remembering the times his Mother got drunk and told him fragments of a life from before he was born.\n\u201cSomething like that. We all fell in love with the magic of the place. Your parents told you about the caves?\u201d\nThe lights have changed. No longer are they industrial lamps but multicolored bulbs suspended in nooks, highlighting the river-smooth stone, textures rounded and formed slowly over time. Tiny Perspex plaques give the formations names nature never did.\n\u201cYou know the stories. They told us as kids to scare us. They said before the caves were rediscovered, they were supposed to be the haunt of witches. Also that business about leaving unwanted babies.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed, oh indeed. And the well? What did they tell you about that?\u201d\nPennies again, corroding in shallow water. Soaking into the gravel floor. He shakes his head to clear the stench.\n\u201cThat people suspended objects in the well to turn them to stone. A tourist attraction.\u201d\n\u201cOne of the first, but a long time before that they were called the Medusa caves. People would leave objects at the entrance with curses then return to find them turned to stone. They\u2019d bury them in their garden of their enemies in the hope that the curses would work.\u201d\n\u201cAnd did they?\u201d\n\u201cDid they what?\u201d Sue ducks through a natural archway and pauses to consider.\n\u201cDid the curses work?\u201d He steps past her.\n\u201cThe stories say so, but maybe the only magic was the magic of geology.\u201d\nThey duck under another low ceiling. This reduced height continues, and Dave hunches, his borrowed hardhat clatters against the stone above. With each rattle, he feels an echo of his Father death.\nStepping into the main chamber, Dave gasps.\nThe petrifying well occupies one full side of the cavern. The noise of trickling water echoes off the stone. He wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. Maybe torrents of water sweeping over the objects suspended from the rockface. There is no such urgency. Each drip seems to take an age, lingering as it impacts on attached surfaces.\nObjects hang on steel hooks from a slack rope beneath the already petrified face. He wonders how much stone has accumulated since that day his Father fell. His grief is marked in stone.\nHe walks forward. Sue does not join him. He can smell the water in the air, the minerals as they coat velvet and metal alike. It does not remind him of pennies, but the sea as if the ocean waits above him to burst into this empty chamber below the earth.\nHe looks up the face of the well, seeing embedded toys and garden tools coated in stone. They poke out of the stone as if trying to remind the world of their fading existence. Not yet willing to give up on the world, and hoping the world does not give up on them. He runs a hand over a nearby doll, her features smoothed away by the constant drip of water catching in her nylon eyelashes.\n\u201cLater,\u201d Sue says, coming to stand beside him. \u201cPeople would write messages to the dead and embed them here. They thought that as their words became trapped, the trapped spirits would be able to read the words. During the Great War the well was like a sorting office for the deceased.\u201d\nAbove him, the cavern rises into darkness, undulating stone out of sight never touched by human skin. He returns his attention to the well and watches a single, mineral laden drop find its way down the smooth stone, halt for a second on the brim of an encased bowler hat, then slide down the string holding a cuddly elephant before bonding with the animal\u2019s staring plastic eye. He wonders how many other eyes are embedded within the wall, hidden and blinded.\nHe remembers his Father\u2019s hand. His own hand, small and young, within his Father\u2019s grasp. Now his hand is large and empty. All he has is the memory of holding his Father\u2019s palm, blood sliding from shattered limbs, a barrier between them, thin and wet and warm, growing cold.\nSue stands beside him, looking into the well. \u201cWe have another cave below this, not open to the public. I think you\u2019ve earned the right.\u201d\nFor the first time, he notices her perfume, reminding him of the smoke from burning heather reaching the city. The scent seems to intensify as she speaks.\nHe nearly declines, celebrating what he has achieved already, and hoping that this fulfills the compact he made when sat beside his Father all those hours in the near dark until help came, him speaking and his Father cleaving words from a broken throat.\n\u201cShow me,\u201d he says, and Sue smiles with all her teeth.\n\u201cThrough here.\u201d She gestures to a patch of darkness in the wall. He goes first, ducking low under the stone, entering into the pitch black beyond. He worries for a moment that the flow of water might speed up, piling minerals so fast the earth will scab over the route back.\nHe glances back and sees only the silhouette of Sue behind him. The tunnel slowly descends, walls either side rough and untamed. He lets his palm drag against the land\u2019s raw wounds and follows the path as it curves and drops.\n\u201cHe was really devoted to your Mother,\u201d she says. Her voice sounds different in the echo of the passage. \u201cWould do anything for her.\u201d\nThe walls contract and Dave turns sideways to proceed. \u201cHe always said she was the pivot around which his life revolved.\u201d He can smell the stone now, the creation and erosion on every side of him. The pressure of change like being in the womb of god.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good way of phrasing it,\u201d Sue says. \u201cTo throw himself down those stairs, to give his life in such a painful and visceral way at her request. That takes devotion.\u201d\nThe words slowly make sense, and by the time they do there is no room to turn. Dave tries, but his shoulders wedge against the walls on either side, and he cannot resist as the needle slides into his neck pressing sleep through his skin. He feels the individual beads of liquid enter his vein, and a cold darkness solidify within him.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe man next to him is older. In various places the weight of stone collecting has torn patches of skin away from his face. He too has pipes connecting him to machines in hidden parts of the room.\n\u201cMy son,\u201d a voice says. Sue steps into view, but Dave struggles to see her as the water drops collect in his eyelashes. \u201cHe\u2019s been here a while now, but won\u2019t last much longer. That\u2019s why it\u2019s your time.\u201d\nThe man groans. Something has gnawed a hole in his jaw, or it might be an infected wound.\n\u201cIn the older days we didn\u2019t have these medical options to keep the boys alive,\u201d Sue continues, runs a chewed fingernail across Dave\u2019s face. \u201cWe had to keep chiseling the accumulation from their mouths to feed them. Collect the piss and shit in buckets. Used to stink in here. Not so long ago, really.\u201d\nHe looks at the stone walls stretching high over them. In the thin artificial light he sees the outlines of people beneath the surface of the flowstone, most so vague they are barely contours. Some faces are pressed into the mineral as if they sought to dive further, cross to another place.\n\u201cWhy did he have to die?\u201d His voice sounds muffled in the tiny cavern.\nSue shrugs. \u201cSacrifices take many forms. Your Mother is very devout and wanted to demonstrate that commitment in the most complete way possible. It\u2019s true that children were left at the entrance of the cave by cruel families, but they didn\u2019t die. The girls became witches, and the boys became invocations and geology and the living earth. They became the source of the magic\u2014they still do.\u201d She strokes his cheek. \u201cYou, Dave Stavehand, are part of a lasting tradition.\u201d\nHe feels a single button of moisture settle in place, gripping the stubble of his beard. Shaking his head, he tries to dislodge it. The water and minerals within refuse to move. In his mind he pictures the thousands of rivulets that will tumble from the stone above to encase him in the wall like the silent figure to his side.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Sue adjusts a dial and he feels warmth trickle into his stomach. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep you healthy. You have a long life ahead of you.\u201d","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue36\/3lbe36_story1.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"The sensation of damp gravel against his hand is exactly as Dave remembered, sharp and nauseating at the same time.

We watch TV, if we must remain awake. I clean my rifle once a week by the flickering television screen. The moths flitter against the mosquito netting, and the girls are in bed by eight, before even the bats come out.\nWe got in the habit of locking them in, too. They were such restless horses in the dark, wandering to the kitchen, flipping on lights, and seeking out their toys when they should be in bed. My wife had a sister that did that and got killed back in England when a wild animal took her in the night and she was wandering around late and no one knew. She instituted the rule. We tuck the girls in. We close the door. We lock it from the outside. The screen is unchanged. There isn\u2019t a way to get the screen out without pulling them off the nails that hold them down.\nSo, how did their shoes get so dirty at night? When I unlocked the door in the morning, their shoes were covered with an inch thick of fresh mud, and lined up along the windowsill like they were innocent. The girls acted innocent, too. They put on their shoes like nothing had happened, and tromped through the house, making screams and confusion before breakfast, tracking mud. We had to mop every morning. The animals suffered empty stomachs in dirty pens on account of those muddy shoes.\n\u201cThey\u2019re up to something,\u201d I said to my wife.\n\u201cYou always say that,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll handle it. Just because they made a mess\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWe hosed down after working in the chicken yard. I hosed down their shoes before dinner. We set them out to dry by the window. Remember?\u201d\nShe was stirring something. It was going to be cheese, someday, I think. \u201cThey must have got up and out before we noticed. No matter, old man. I will fix it all tonight.\u201d\nBut the door was locked, right?\nMy four girls, my pride and joy, my beautiful ones, all out in the yard with the cows. They were responsible for putting all the hay down today, and then they had to weed the garden patch they were keeping with their mom while school was out. They each had their mother\u2019s black, tightly-curly hair, and her delicate, wide-eyed Jamaican face. Their pale blue eyes, like the sky itself, were all mine. It was their eyes that told me truth, when they were lying. I could see their little brains working behind their huge, pale eyes.\n\u201cHey, Philomena, get in here!\u201d\nShe turned, my youngest, and the least honest. If anyone was going to start lying, it would be her.\n\u201cOne second, Da!\u201d\nShe brushed the hay from her dirty overalls, and looked down at her shoes.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a mess, girl. Stay outside. I will meet you with the pigs.\u201d\nShe seemed to perk up at this, and then she brushed back her hair with her hands, tidying up her dark curls as best she could. \u201cOkay, da!\u201d\nShe jogged over to the pig pens, poking at her hair like she wanted to clean herself up a little. Her ma does the same when she\u2019s nervous. I never noticed it in Philomena before. I asked her nicely how she got her shoes so dirty.\nShe said she was sure her shoes were always so dirty. Look at them! They\u2019re dirty now!\n\u201cWhen you went to bed they were clean.\u201d\n\u201cNu huh. They were dirty, da. Everything here is always dirty. I don\u2019t want to live on a farm when I grow up. I want to be a ballerina. I want to live in Paris and dance all night instead.\u201d\nShe wasn\u2019t good at lying. I knew something was up.\nI let them get on with it, but I had an eye out for them. By mid-afternoon, they were green around the gills and drooping. They hadn\u2019t slept enough lately. We cleaned their shoes before letting them into the house, and let them drip dry on their windowsill.\nBy dinner, they were hanging their heads and dropping asleep at the table.\n\u201cY\u2019all had too much fun last night. You need to get to bed early to get the whole day right.\u201d\n\u201cWe know, Dad,\u201d said Esmeralda. \u201cWe can go to bed early tonight, though, right? You don\u2019t got more for us to do?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t take that tone with your father,\u201d said Ma. \u201cDo the dishes.\u201d\nAw, Ma, and nothing to it. They stumbled up to the sink and got washing.\nShe winked at me.\n\u201cToo tired for any mischief tonight, I reckon. How anyone has time for mischief in this world is beyond me. Goodness.\u201d\nDeep down, I was so tired from a day in the fields. After dinner, I sipped weak coffee from the couch, and nodded off, watching my girls and my wife looking over them, and everyone so tired.\nThrough the window, where the sun still hadn\u2019t completely tumbled below the alfalfa fields, I saw a fox running through the yard, around the chicken wire and out to the street.\nTomorrow, I\u2019d have to check the wire, make sure it\u2019s deep enough.\nI woke up long enough to get the girls into bed, and shut the door behind them.\nThe lock turned, and the wife and I stumbled off to bed and a sound, dreamless haze. Whoever heard of a farmer that can\u2019t sleep like a stone?\nCome daybreak, we was up and moving already. When we went to wake the girls, we saw their shoes on the windowsill, filthy as a pigsty, more mud than canvas, and oozing all over the wall and floor before their window.\n\u201cHuh,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYup,\u201d said my wife. \u201cI thought it might be that. Esme is as old as I was when my sister died. You have to let me handle this, Old Yeller. I know this like I know you ain\u2019t listening to me, and you\u2019re going to be foolish, but you need to let me handle this.\u201d\n\u201cI will tan their hides like leather,\u201d I said. \u201cThey\u2019re ruining good shoes. We ain\u2019t made of cash.\u201d\n\u201cI know, old man. Don\u2019t I know that. You have to let me handle this. There\u2019s a fox in this field, I reckon. I wanted to lock \u2019em in myself and be sure before I did anything drastic. There\u2019s some deception afoot.\u201d\n\u201cI got to spray today.\u201d\n\u201cGo spray, then. Go on,\u201d she said. She turned to her girls, all sleeping deep as dead pigeons. \u201cAll right. Everybody up. Right now. Now, girls. Little Mena, you too. No one sleeps in. No one gets breakfast and no one leaves this room until you explain the mess of your shoes over there.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to check the screen on the outsides,\u201d I said.\nI went outside and checked the nails, and they were holding the screen in place.\nFrom there, I saw footprints in the soil of four legs and claws. Foxes sniffing around, right up by the house.\nMa gave the girls the riot act, but none confessed, and I had to go before the rains got close. Oh, they were hiding something, all right.\nOut by the hen hutch, I checked the chicken wire. Something had pulled at it, but it was buried so deep that it couldn\u2019t be just pulled like that.\nAll the chores had to be done, but the girls feigned illness and limped in from the summer heat. I left my wife to the invalids and got out some heavy stones from the rubbish pile. The chickens looked out at me like they had no idea I was doing anything to them at all. They wanted feed and pecked around the ground where the rocks settled.\nBy nightfall, the wife and I were both ready for a long night. I put on a thermos of hot coffee, and she already had her big cup of tea.\n\u201cFlip ya for it,\u201d I said.\n\u201cGet on to bed, old man. You got to be in the field tomorrow, and I don\u2019t. I\u2019ll watch my girls. My sister and I did the same, we was their age. You can check on us if you wake up early.\u201d\nShe went in with her tea where the girls were already exhausted in bed. That night, I thought of foxes at the window and frustrations and got my rifle clean and ready. I used to have a good hound to go to ground and flush, but she got hit by a semi a while back. I never had the heart for another dog after that much pain.\nI sipped my pitch black, cold coffee and got my eyes used to the flood light above the barn.\nI waited, then. I thought about my beautiful girls. I listened to the chickens rustling hay in slumber and animals roaming their pens and night music from all the field frogs and summer bugs.\nI\u2019d hunted foxes before. My father-in-law, when he was alive, taught me how. He was Jamaican, but had spent thirty years in England working on country estates. He had loved the baying hounds, the thrill of the chase. They had always done it on four-wheelers, with a pack of mutts that were mostly beagle. I missed him.\nThe world wants to lull a weary body down.\nA fog rolled in off the fields. It was not the season for mist, but there it was, and I was ready. I got up and took the flashlight from the wall. I left it off for a while, and walked past the garden to the chickens. I heard the restless animals, and something wrong moving among the fog like a red hornet in the night.\nMovement, and the flashlight went on. A white-tipped tail low to the ground. Slowly I raised my gun.\nIn this fog? There was no clean shot, and my girls\u2019 shoes were so muddy. I\u2019d rather lose every chicken, every pig and horse and cow, than take one shot and I\u2019m not sure where the bullet ends in the long acres of the night.\nI lowered the gun.\nThe fox was gone through the fog.\nFrogs\u2019 sang like bells in the dark. Crickets made creaking laughter.\nI raised my rifle again to shoot the ground. At least I could scare the beasts for the night, and come back when there\u2019s clear moonlight.\nThe rapport boomed into the darkness. Dogs howled and every beast trembled and moaned from the power of the gun. The fog shattered like being blown from a mighty wind.\nOut in the alfalfa, in the clear view of the moon and the stars and the floodlight, the startled fox looked at me, the light reflecting in its animal eyes.\nI had one shot, clean as the moon reflecting in a still pond, and nothing but empty night out beyond the creature.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n2: Mother Knows\nMy father will tell you this, and most will think he is exaggerating. He says that the reason they hunted foxes was because the fox was a dog that had sworn allegiance not to mankind, but to the nephilim. The fox was a servant of fallen angels. Its fiery pelt, and its beady eyes and the way it ran alone when proper dogs preferred the pack were all signs of its evil nature. To hunt the fox was to protect the farm, to protect the fields, and to remove the influence of the devil from the world.\nAnd the foxes were evil. The farmers all knew it. They raised their hounds and sounded the trumpet to flush the beasts from their wicked warrens. They prayed to god for a glorious hunt, and chased the beasts over field and fence and forest.\nWhen we moved to America, because my father could buy lots of land there, we carried with us the memory of foxes and fox hunting and there were still foxes in America. There were foxes everywhere. Even Australia has her devil dogs.\nMy father told the same story about foxes at every gathering until the day his lungs collapsed.\nHis boss had been losing chickens. Da had been setting traps. He said that he went out and saw the fox in the trap, and it was chewing its leg off. It was swallowing as it chewed and growling about it. It was eating itself to escape a trap, to bleed to death in freedom, and kill anything it found along the way. He shot and missed. He decided to use the butt of the rifle instead. He walked up to the beast and rose his weapon and the fox escaped before the gun could swing down. The rifle fell upon the quivering stump. The fox attacked and locked its teeth upon Da\u2019s boot. The flesh beneath was torn. He showed off the scars. It formed two horns across his shin with jagged teeth. He said that the demon haunted him always, and nearly every night he dreamed of death.\nHe was from Jamaica, and had carried a strong faith all his life in the will of the Lord. He had worked on farms to save money to go to school for a degree in divinity, to become a preacher, but by the time he was nearly there, he had my sister and me to worry about, and he had spent so much time out in the fields that it was hard to imagine cooping himself up into the cavernous stone tombs and dusty books.\nThe sky is the first cathedral, he had told me. The sunrise is the first prayer on the first day.\nWith my girls, I told them I would tell them a story about a fox.\nThey sat bolt upright. They looked at me as if I had said there would be no dessert for a year.\n\u201cI am going to tell you a story about the fox,\u201d I said. \u201cThe reason he\u2019s here is because he is a wicked liar who wants to cause us all great pain. He enjoys tricking us. That is what he does. Foxes are dishonest creatures, determined to play dangerous tricks on beautiful little girls.\u201d\nEsme answered, \u201cMa, we just want to go to sleep. Do we have to hear a story?\u201d\n\u201cI thought my girls loved a good story. Don\u2019t my girls love good stories?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re so tired, Mommy,\u201d said Hope.\nCharity concurred with her sister and said it slower and moanier.\n\u201cYou can close your eyes if you wanna,\u201d I said. \u201cPeople hear stories better with their eyes closed, anyhow.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need you to trick us into going to sleep, Ma,\u201d said Esme.\n\u201cOh, the story is not really for you,\u201d I said. \u201cThe story is for the fox. He is listening right now, isn\u2019t he? That nasty ol\u2019 fox is right outside the window. I want him to know what I know about his awful race.\u201d\nNow they were rattled. Philomena started sniffling.\n\u201cYou\u2019re scaring Mena!\u201d Shouted Hope. \u201cCan\u2019t you just leave us alone?\u201d\nI sipped my tea and waited until their little storms passed.\n\u201cThe fox,\u201d I said, \u201cis a liar. The only thing he is offering you is death. I should know. Foxes have no honor, and their mothers even less. Never trust a fox, my little chickens. Only trust me, because I love you more than him.\u201d\n\u201cMa!\u201d shouted Charity. The fog was all the way up the window, now. I knew it wouldn\u2019t be long.\n\u201cClose your eyes and go to bed, girl. We\u2019ll all have dirty shoes come daylight.\u201d\nAnd I kept going on about foxes, telling them what I knew.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n3: The Fox Interrupts the Story\nIn fact, they are the descendents of fallen angels that mated with dogs in ancient Sumeria, before the flood. By day they stalk the chickens. By night, they stalk for souls.\nNot just any soul will do, either. It has to be an innocent. It has to be someone young and pure and sweet, like Hope and Charity and Esmerelda and Philomena.\nFoxes come in the night and knock on the window. Knock knock knock. You hear it? There it is. I know that sound because I heard it when I was young and sweet like you. I am a bitter, mean, hard soul now, but I was young once. My sister heard the fox at the window, too. She went to the window and saw the fox standing on two legs. He was wearing a dandy top hat and he bowed to us as if we were princesses.\nHe said he was lost and alone and cold and was wondering if my sister and I could offer him some hospitality.\nWell, we were such sweet souls, and we were so excited. We were pleased to invite him in from the fog. He sat down at our little tea table. He poured himself a glass of tea. He asked if we could join him.\n\u201cMa,\u201d said Esme, \u201cyou don\u2019t have a sister.\u201d\nI used to. When I was very small. She was the sweetest one. She was so sweet. She never came back.\nFirst, he told us that he had been out in the farm a while and starving. He was so hungry, and everything was set up against him. There wasn\u2019t anything for a fox to eat and weren\u2019t we neighbors? Mr. Fox had a silver tongue in that red body all right. I started pulling at the chicken wire. I started fiddling with the rabbit hutch. My sister told me I shouldn\u2019t but the fox told us he would have to leave if he couldn\u2019t find anything to eat. And then we wouldn\u2019t be able to go dancing with him.\nWe did like dancing.\nI was the one who pulled at the chicken wire and loosened the rabbit hutch.\nAnd for a few nights there was dancing. We walked out unto the moonlight, out into the fields. The crickets chirped and birds sang high and long while beetles thumped upon each other like castanets. We danced with the fox, we whirled around the yard. By daylight our shoes were muddy.\nWe feasted in the dark. We ate roast pigeon, wild grapes, pickled dormice dipped in marzipan, sweetbread shaped of hedgehog, and corn stolen from our own fields. The fox complained that he could not offer us better. He had so little. He begged us to open the rabbit hutch. My sister wouldn\u2019t do it. She told me not to, but our friend the fox was so handsome.\nYou are still handsome, Mr. Fox. This is no place for your tricks.\n\u2014I adore new friends. Are you their lovely mother?\nIt is my place to protect my girls from devils, Mr. Fox. I have dealt with devils before. Do you know what I did to the fox that came to eat my sister\u2019s soul?\n\u2014You stabbed it through the throat with a spike. It didn\u2019t help, did it?\nSo, I\u2019m saying to you, Mr. Fox, that I know what you\u2019re doing, and I want you to leave my girls alone.\n\u2014We can make a deal. Tell me what you want and I\u2019ll tell you what I want.\nI want you to leave and never come back.\n\u2014I want to stay forever with my friends.\nTheir souls belong to God, not you.\n\u2014You are, of course, a mother and responsible for their souls. You are authorized to deal. Which one, then? Who do you think will come with me, and who will stay and be obedient to you? You offer them nothing but work and suffering and school, and I want only to dance in the night, feast well, and see the big, wide world, in all its wonders.\nIllusions of a feast in the dark, and waking up hungry. All you offer is a fog. Girls, listen to me, the fox will only betray you after you betray me. It is the nature of fog to reflect the sins of the observer. Look upon this fog and know it for what it is. When I stabbed the fox in the throat, I held my sister\u2019s life in my hands.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n4: Esmerelda, Like Her Father\nThis is why I had a good fish knife in my sleeve, from the dishes we had done.\nMa was going to make a deal to keep us safe, but that isn\u2019t what Da would do. Da would shoot the fox as soon as it came close to the chickens.\nI knew what he were doing was wrong, even if it was wonderful.\nI knew Philomena was pulling at the chicken wire for our visitor. I knew the fox had to be some kind of monster that wanted all our little chickens. They were our chickens. We don\u2019t just kill them for anybody, and only when the season is right. Besides, I like eggs. I like eggs every morning. I go out to the hutch with Charity and we hunt for them together.\nI didn\u2019t think Ma and Da would believe me.\nSo I had a knife under the covers. I\u2019d taken it from washing dishes. I thought Da would be brave enough, fast enough, and tough enough to fight back.\nMy bed was the closest to the window and I would wait until the fox appeared. The fog pushed through the cracks in the wood. It was thick in our room. Then the fox stepped out of the fog. Then, it bowed for us gracefully, sweeping the top hat from its head and invited us to another grand party in the alfalfa field.\nI shouted in a pause in the argument.\n\u2014Mr. Fox! Maybe we can play games in here. How come we can\u2019t just stay in the room tonight. What if it rains?\n\u2014Well, I am so hungry. I do not know how I will get through the night playing silly games in this empty bedroom. I much prefer dancing with tea cakes close at hand. Are you quite sure games in a bedroom is more fun than dancing and tea cakes?\n\u2014I like tea cakes, said Charity.\n\u2014And I like dancing, said Philomena. My favorite is the grand waltz.\n\u2014Well, my duckies, let us go play your lovely sister\u2019s game, at the very least, and then we shall waltz and eat tea cakes and howl to the moon like wild dogs. But, we shall stay far from the alfalfa field. On my honor, we will never touch a single blade of alfalfa.\n\u2014No games, Mr. Fox, this is the last night you come around. You will never get what you want here. My girls are good. They listen to their mama. If I tell them to leave you alone, they will. I demand truth in the fog. I demand it and it is my right to demand on my sister\u2019s blood.\n\u2014Chickens would be nice. They are such delicious creatures, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\n\u2014You don\u2019t give two shits about chickens, fool. No games. No. Tell the truth to the girls or we go nowhere. What do you actually want to eat?\n\u2014Oh, I am sure you have already told them.\n\u2014You say it.\n\u2014Souls, madame. But, I do not hurt anyone. I am always the victim.\n\u2014I used to have a sister. She believed you, too. One night you had us play a game where we stood on fence posts and tried to wake the sleeping hogs with rocks. He would charge the fence when he got angry enough and we were supposed to be up out of reach. But, when he struck the fencepost was loose and my sister fell in. The hog we saw every day of our lives crushed her dead. The fox said she was just catching up on lost sleep. And, he pulled her out with me to a little bed he had set up in the barn. We tucked her in. We sang lullabies together. Come morning they found me out there, with her gone and mauled and me next to her mangled body like everything was just fine and she was going to wake up any minute. I killed him the next night. It wasn\u2019t him, though. It just looked like him.\nBut, we wouldn\u2019t play the game I wanted if ma kept talking. I knew we wouldn\u2019t. I was counting on the game. Marco Polo, anywhere at all. The fox would like it because blindfolds meant he could play his tricks. We always did something to break the farm, why not the bedroom? We stomped through the alfalfa the very first night. The second, we waltzed straight to the generator and knocked it over and gasoline spilled and it\u2019s probably busted and Da won\u2019t know until winter comes and he\u2019s trying to work the lights.\nEvery little waltz ends not when the music stops, but when we tumble into something.\nMa is here. She says she won\u2019t leave the room, in fact, and neither will we. She says whatever fun the fox has, will have to happen right here in the room, and nobody runs into the fog at the edge of our little world.\n\u2014That\u2019s not fair to the girls, he says, because there is only so much fun one can have without the orchestra and the spotlight moon.\n\u2014I am their mother, and they must obey me. It is a law as old as your wicked ways. Honor thy father and mother.\nI walked right over, as if going to get my shoes from the windowsill. I had a clean shot, right behind the fox, where I could cut his throat like a carrot.\nI\u2019ve pulled skin and fur from dead rabbit meat. I\u2019ve wrung chicken necks in anger and been grounded for it. I moved so carefully. He saw nothing.\n\u2014Well, if we\u2019re going to be stuck in this miserable little room of dullness and drear, do tell me what deal you had in mind, dusky maid, and I shall consider your offer.\nI had a clean shot. The fox was distracted. The beast must die.\n\u2014You are a creature of great power, I know. I remember my sister and what happened to her when I was young. I knew right away when I saw my daughters\u2019 shoes. My husband doesn\u2019t know. Take me. Take me and leave my girls alone. Ain\u2019t I enough? One tough old soul to make the next taste so sweet?\n\u2014No mama, I said. I jumped on the fox\u2019s back and grabbed his throat. He yipped with laughter.\nMa was on us so fast, then.\n\u2014Ma, why you stopping me like this? Ma, I\u2019m going to kill him. I\u2019m going to kill the monster before something bad happens!\n\u2014I know, girl, but don\u2019t! Don\u2019t! You have to let me handle it! Thou shalt not kill!\nShe wrenched the knife from my hand.\nThe fox, as if this was all a big game, was laughing and laughing. It sounded like a hyena laughing. He was rolling in a big, long belly laugh.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n5: The Ballerina\nI love to dance the waltz. I love to dance.\nDa says that I can be anything I set out to be if I work hard enough. The fox says that I have amazing potential, not to be squandered on the backbreaking labor of gardening and farming. I would be better off anywhere but here. I could waltz in Wallonia under the glittering starlight. I could tango in Andalusia, where horses dance like savage lovers to the music of guitars.\nMy favorite tea cake is the lemonpoppyfrog.\nThe little tadpoles are sweet and tangy.\nWe aren\u2019t supposed to tell anyone about the fox, or he will go away.\nIf Ma knows, then why doesn\u2019t she tell someone? If she really wants the fox to go away, she could just tell someone. That\u2019s what will get rid of him. She must want him to stay, too, and she\u2019s just being mean. She\u2019s always so mean to us. We never get to have any fun.\nI want to tell Da, but I don\u2019t want the fox to go away. I don\u2019t care if all the chickens get eaten. I don\u2019t even like eggs. I hate eating anything that comes from an animal\u2019s butt. That\u2019s where eggs come from. Ma says it\u2019s not the butt. She says it\u2019s the cloaca, and it isn\u2019t anything to worry about. I think it\u2019s gross. I want to dance the vigorous mazurka in the royal palace of Warsaw. I want to sing the happy polonaise in grandfather\u2019s England, where the irises fill the night with perfume.\nI have a better solution to make the fox go away, but nobody listens to me.\nWhat I did was, I wrote a letter to my grandfather and stamped it and everything. I told him what was happening, and I decided that if the fox didn\u2019t take me before the letter got to my grandfather, he probably wasn\u2019t telling the truth. Esme says we have to be careful because we don\u2019t know if he\u2019s telling the truth, and sometimes people lie to get what they want.\nI don\u2019t think the fox is lying. I want to go dance all night and eat tea cakes in the moonlight, and never, ever come back, except to visit because I know it would make Ma so sad.\nI don\u2019t want anyone to hurt the fox. He\u2019s going to take me to Paris.\nI get in between Ma and Mena and the fox. I get in the way and raise my hands and I shout, and then I run out the door and into the night world the fox has opened for us. I run and howl and bay and call out for everything in the world to hear.\n\u2014I want to dance!\n\u2014I want to leap with the frogs!\n\u2014I want to eat tea cakes in the moonlight!\n\u2014Stop fighting and come play!\nThe moonlight is there for us, as bright as the sun. The stars are our Christmas lights, the fireflies our applause.\nOh, there is such music, here, and such beauty in the night.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n6: The Fox Always Escapes\nThe princesses go dancing when they are supposed to be asleep. Their shoes wear out. In the story, a young man stalks the darkness after the mystery, and watches his future bride dancing in the moonlight with the devils of the hidden world.\nWhat they never tell you in the story is that I told the story first, so you would know me when I come to your window.\nThe boom cuts all illusions with its suddenness.\nThe death, when it comes, is a fox in the moonlight, shattering into blood and sinew, and bullets need no silver in their hull to boil illusion off the skin.\nI escaped, of course. I always get away scot-free. Away with the lifted fog.\nCharity, Hope, you who never betrayed me, come.\nFor us, the world will always be dancing.\nI blew in on the fog. I blow out on it, too.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n7: Epilogue\nAlready the squirrels are burying nuts against the winter, sowing their crops where the sunflowers and pigweed grow wild, as the bindweed lurking beneath the alfalfa rises and chokes out all the weaker seeds. Old timers look out at another fallow field turning wild, and see nature in all her yellow amaranth sadness, her jagged red pokeweed rage. The soil itself will be devoured here, and that right soon.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue26\/3lbe26_story4.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"High growing season is no time for running around in the dark.

The worst is realizing, in the journey that comes after life, that I do not know my way after all. And neither do you. For all your talk of navigation and sailing the high seas, you have taken me into the darkest jungle of a night-world and left me there. There is no clue to the path. You, Peter Millican, brought me here. I followed your lead. And now I\u2019m stuck.\nBut before this, in my last dream courtesy of Dreamtech, I was a Princess. An object of desire, and I liked it. We are not meant to like being objectified, are we? But I was the object of my own desire, sparkling pretty, like the sun on a smiling sea. I launched the cruise ship with a champagne bottle. The next thing I knew I was on it, amongst the men on this maiden voyage. Just one princess in the Captain\u2019s Cabin, waiting coyly for a knock on my door.\nAnd you knocked, dream invader, head thief. You strolled into my fantasy and presented yourself, dressed as a king, in a crown of iron and a military suit, dark blue, brass buttons. Naval, perhaps. You outranked me.\nI should have sent you away. I can\u2019t pretend I didn\u2019t recognize you, Peter Millican. But my life has been such a straight line. I lived from A and B, and coming across the giant Y of You threw me a curve ball of spectacular seduction. I wanted it to happen.\nSo this expensive last request, courtesy of my bells-and-whistles insurance policy for Permament and Total Disability, switched me from boring ugly old Barbara Elmsworth to a Princess.\nAnd then worst happens. I meet you. You interrupt my planned week-long cruise amongst an all-male population, and seduce me with talk of steering my ship for me. And you steer me here. I can hear the tigers, moving closer. I cling on to my tree branch and pray they don\u2019t know how to climb. I\u2019m awash with sweat. My party dress is torn and I\u2019ve lost my tiara.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cHe\u2019s hopped,\u201d says the Client Assistant.\n\u201cCan we not use that phrase?\u201d says the Client Officer. \u201cHe\u2019s not the Easter Bunny. He\u2019s not a bouncy animal from a Disney cartoon.\u201d\n\u201cSorry. He\u2019s transferred.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s better. You never hear me talking of hopping, do you? Add it to the tally, then. What\u2019s the total?\u201d\npeter millican. 203.\n\u201cInform the hospital they should turn off Miss Elmsworth\u2019s life support,\u201d says the Client Officer. He steps back from the screen, rubs his bald head, and looks around the darkened crisis center. It is a safe, snug womb of an office. Pleasantly hot. At least two members of staff are yawning. \u201cBetter to go early with a plug-pull than wait around in the Recess for some wild animal to maul you. Right?\u201d\nThe assistant isn\u2019t so sure. Maybe the Recess isn\u2019t all that they say it is. He\u2019s never been to a jungle, so he has only fictional ideas on which to base his mental picture. He thinks of Tarzan and a botanical garden he once visited on a school trip. And the alternative is death, earlier rather than later.\nHe decides not to inform the hospital. It\u2019s only a few days until they switch her off, anyway. She can hang on in there for that long.\n\u201cLet me know when he transfers again.\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course.\u201d\n\u201cYou can message me on my private line. Just keep tabs on him.\u201d\nNow who\u2019s into flights of fantasy? The Client Officer likes to think of himself as a private detective, or maybe the chief of police. He hunts the criminal down the long dark corridors of the mind, pitching his wits, relying on his hard-nosed instinct. All the clich\u00e9s for the Client Officer. His dreams are film noir, no doubt. Will he catch Peter Millican? The Client Assistant is not persuaded by his bullish speech. He\u2019s been working here long enough to lose faith in the process. He\u2019s refused the employee right to a Dreamtech end and isn\u2019t going to live out his last fantasy when it comes to that. He\u2019s seen it go wrong too often.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAnd I\u2019m on the moon.\nThe moon really is made of cheese.\nI sit down and break open the cracker barrel. Water biscuits. My favorite. And a small trowel. I skim the waxy yellow surface of the moon and up curls a delightful slice of gouda. I place it on my cracker and munch, looking out at the view of the Earth. It\u2019s a blue-green bauble hanging on a curtain of space, warmer and softer than I had expected. No spacesuit or helmet required.\nMy nose twitches. There is some mouse left in me after all. I can smell \u2026 humanity. It stinks, lacking the simplicity of curds and dairy products. Can I really smell it all the way out here, so far from the home planet? We humans really carry.\nNo, it\u2019s not coming from Earth. It\u2019s coming from behind me. I turn and see\u2014\nYou.\n\u201cHello,\u201d you say. \u201cMy name is Peter Millican. That\u2019s a heck of a view you\u2019ve got.\u201d\nI don\u2019t know you. Or do I? I think you might have been at my wedding. That face in the photo, the line-up, some distant relative, or a friend of a friend. No, didn\u2019t you deliver my second daughter? Or perhaps you were the anesthetist for my wisdom tooth removal. Are you here to remind me of these things, events, happenings? Is this a dream of cheese and psychotherapy?\n\u201cGreat imagination,\u201d you say, and suddenly I\u2019m sure that I don\u2019t know you after all.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I say. \u201cI wanted to be different.\u201d\n\u201cCheese is so tasty, isn\u2019t it?\u201d you say. \u201cMind if I\u2026?\u201d\nI nod, and you crouch down to scoop up a handful of my moon, munching with gusto. It feels like a bit of an imposition, to be honest.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cTerry. Terry Mead.\u201d\n\u201cPleased to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cAre you from the hospital?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d You have a great smile. It\u2019s a pleasant face, with a transforming crook of the lips to make you charming. You knew this, of course. You use it with aplomb. It strikes me that you\u2019re a salesman. If I had been blessed with that smile I could have done a lot better than I did. I don\u2019t quite know what I mean by that. What is better than a wife, a job, a home, two daughters? And yet, even now, I think of opportunity, that glimmering light that never leaves me. The hope of eternal optimism.\n\u201cAre you here to save me?\u201d I ask.\nYou shake your head and wipe the crumbs from your cheek. \u201cSorry. By the time people get to this stage they\u2019re beyond saving.\u201d\n\u201cYou too?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely me too. More so than you.\u201d\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be in your own dream, then?\u201d And I then I realize I do know you after all, at least by reputation. Peter Millican, multi-millionaire, head of Dreamtech, face of a thousand adverts \u2014 death can be a dream, sweetheart!\nBut you\u2019re dead.\nYou died before me, years ago. There was a funeral. You were indulging your hobby of demolition derby and became the meat in a metal sandwich. I remember. But it seems impolite to mention it.\nI dig up some more cheese and choose another cracker, but it\u2019s losing its appeal. Do you sense my disquiet? You come and sit next to me, and we stare at the Earth, which is looking more and more vulnerable by the second. It\u2019s defenseless out here, amid the emptiness. A giant foot could land on it at any second.\nI\u2019m beginning to hate my imagination.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got two days of cheese ahead of me,\u201d I say.\nYou nod.\n\u201cGreat.\u201d\n\u201cWas this really your heart\u2019s desire?\u201d\n\u201cI thought about doing the naked ladies thing but it just seemed so predictable. Besides, my wife wouldn\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\u201cTell you what,\u201d you say. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me take you away to a better place than this? If you end up in a bunch of naked ladies it\u2019s my fault, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cCan you do that?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely. Just relax and let me in. Can I\u2026?\u201d You put your hand on the back of my neck. I don\u2019t think any man has ever done that before. Having my prostate checked regularly towards the end, and then the operation that didn\u2019t work, yes, but a hand on the neck is less clinical, isn\u2019t it? Can I really relax into this?\nYou hum something. It\u2019s a tune from a musical. It soothes me. And I let down my defenses. I let you in.\nThe moon of cheese dissolves underneath me. The Earth begins to shrink away, to no more than a dot, a pinhole, and then it winks out of existence.\nIt\u2019s so dark.\n\u201cHello?\u201d I say. I want to be alive, just one more time, I want flesh to rub against another, the soft and the hard and the rubbing of skin to skin. I want to be a young man in a body that\u2019s under my command, ready to stand to attention. Could you, Peter Millican, give that to me? I\u2019ve given you my moon, so can\u2019t you give me a night of lovely ladies, just once?\nI feel humidity, heat pricking my skin, the first beads of sweat. Shapes press close around me as the blackness lifts, slowly, slowly. Trees, vines, the sound of birds with strange calls. A realization of time and place, presence and peril.\nAnd the low, low growl of a tiger.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe Client Assistant lets his hands fall from the interface. Two hundred and four dreams intercepted. Two hundred and four transfers from head to head.\nCan it really be hushed up indefinitely?\nThe Client Officer puts one hand on his bald head and takes a deep breath. \u201cWe\u2019re no closer to catching him. Two years, and we\u2019re no closer. We have to do something. Something drastic.\u201d\nThe Client Assistant is not sure if he\u2019s meant to reply. He is applying for other roles in the organization away from the trouble-shooting end. He\u2019s sure he could forget all of this, given the opportunity. Let others mop up the Millican mess. Let the police come, let the Net get wind of it. The dreams that were paid for have been hijacked. Somewhere, in an unknown location, the remains of the company\u2019s founder is wired up to a life support machine and Dreamtech interface, and his mind stalks the dying through their last fantasies so he can banish them to his personal idea of hell. He takes revenge \u2014 for what? What is he getting out of this? He hangs on to his half-life with the determination he once applied to his organization.\n\u201cContact the hospital,\u201d says the Client Officer. \u201cYou know what to do. I\u2019ve got an idea of how to stop him. I\u2019ll need a few days to get it set up. In the meantime, contact me if it happens again. Tail him. Don\u2019t let him out of your sight.\u201d\nOf course, Detective, thinks the Client Assistant. Staring at the screen and rubbing your bald head has become such an important part of the process.\nTerry Mead, victim two hundred and four, is out there in the jungle of dead dreams. Maybe he\u2019s a great white hunter, with an elephant gun and a pith helmet. Maybe he\u2019s in a loincloth, swinging from tree to tree. It doesn\u2019t have to be just pain, does it?\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI reach the end of my song, take in the rapturous applause, watch the flowers being thrown to my feet and then I open my mouth to begin again. I get to do this for days, and I\u2019m going to enjoy it every single time.\nThe stage trapdoor opens and you pop up.\nYou are dressed in a tailcoat and cravat. You look the part. But this is my solo, I paid for it fair and square, and you should not be here. You are not Valjean. You are a charlatan. I feel it.\nYou tell me you\u2019re sorry to have interrupted. You tell me I have great taste. This is your girlfriend\u2019s favorite musical. Or it was. You tell me this has brought back memories, brought you to a fresh realization of who you are, what you want. You ask if you can kiss me, just once, as a thank you, and that idea shocks me into a reply.\n\u201cNo! Get off my stage. I\u2019m singing.\u201d\n\u201cListen, I just\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m in control here. You\u2019re interrupting my performance.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re dreaming a dream.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\n\u201cYour last dream,\u201d you say.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d I whisper. My real body is so very old. A machine keeps it breathing. There\u2019s no breath, no air, no song of my own. In my small house, my relatives will gather, moan about my choice to spend my legacy on Dreamtech, and then they will divide up my CD collection of classic musicals. Or maybe they\u2019ll just give them all to charity. Goodbye to Cats, Starlight Express, West Side Story, Grease, Joseph. A long line of very old friends. Some people worry about what will happen to their pets after death. I worry about what will happen to my music.\nAnd Les Miserables, my favorite; it deserves no concern on its behalf. It will go on and on without me. Fantine will have her front teeth pulled a million times more, and Valjean will last throughout eternity. Les Mis is a work of art, no less. It will last forever.\n\u201cI\u2019m Peter Millican,\u201d you say.\n\u201cSo what? Piss off.\u201d\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard of me?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care, I don\u2019t care, get off the stage.\u201d\n\u201cI made Dreamtech. I designed this dream.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t. You didn\u2019t. I specified it to a designer.\u201d\n\u201cI made the technology. I made a place where dreams can come true. And I made another place, where dreams go to die. A place where tigers come at night.\u201d\n\u201cWith their voices soft as thunder,\u201d I say. I know these lines so well. I know that place. I lived my entire life there.\n\u201cFantine always dies, doesn\u2019t she? She can\u2019t fight the tigers,\u201d you say. You are handsome and clever. You are Valjean, after all. And I know how these scene ends.\nI don\u2019t want to sing any more.\nThe crowd is restless. The green strands of my song have faded away, and the chandelier brightens as the stage lights dim. It\u2019s time to go home. The curtain descends.\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t have to be the end,\u201d you say, and you look so earnest, so solid, that I believe you. \u201cI can save you. Take you to a place where you can fight the tigers, and maybe even win.\u201d\nI can\u2019t move. I don\u2019t want to die, even if it means spoiling the show.\nYou walk to me, and enfold me in your arms. You kiss me once, and suddenly the stage lights are bright and hot once more, and the crowd roars their approval. For once, The Glums end happily for Fantine. I\u2019m going to wrestle those big cats and make rugs out of them.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThis is a bit extreme, isn\u2019t it? thinks the Client Assistant. He\u2019s really hoping his transfer comes through sooner rather than later. The Invoicing Department have expressed a keen interest in having him aboard.\nHe places the Dreamtech net over the Client Officer\u2019s head and switches it on. Somewhere deep in that bald pate the specified dream begins to unfold. Here\u2019s hoping it\u2019s good enough to catch a thief.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe great Alfonz Poisson rubs his bald head with one hand and ticks his choice on the sheet: halibut, followed by beef wellington. He might have a cr\u00e9me caramel to finish, if indigestion doesn\u2019t strike. It\u2019s a heavy lunch; he promises himself he\u2019ll have a light dinner. He contemplates his stomach, the top fold of the napkin draped over its bulge, and thinks of what he will say at the Istanbul conference. His keynote speech is entitled \u201cThe Cunning Mind of the Modern Criminal\u201d but he hasn\u2019t bothered to write it yet. Maybe tonight. Maybe not.\nAt the back of his brain, he has a tiny thought that being Alfonz Poisson is far superior to being a Client Officer.\nThe dining car door is flung open.\n\u201cMurder!\u201d screams a young woman in a flapper dress with a pink feather in her hair and loops of pearl strung around her slender neck. \u201cMurder in the baggage car!\u201d And then she faints clean away.\nAlfonz Poisson takes his napkin from his lap and puts it next to his plate. The halibut will have to wait.\nHe makes his way to the baggage car. Three bodies, laid out in a row. They are dressed identically, in black. There are no marks, no signs of a struggle. They all wear white laminated name tags, attached to their chests by tiny gold safety pins.\nbarbara elmsworth\nterry mead\nsally tombow\nAlfonz examines them closely, taking in their faces, and the arrangement of their bodies. Beneath his placid exterior great calculations are taking place. He has a mind like a razor: sharp, slicing. He has travelled the world solving the most difficult of cases, and he knows how to assemble a motley group of suspects and keep them hanging on his every word until all is revealed through their own fallibility. The guilty eyes, the shifty glances \u2014 he reads these with ease. He smiles a little as he takes in the scene. He knows exactly how to solve this mystery. The halibut may not be ruined after all.\nOnly half an hour later, once more in the dining car, Poisson speaks to the assembled travelers: the Pargeters, the Quincy-Smythes, Lord and Lady Trumbuloe and the entourage of suspicious maids and manservants. They all squirm in their seats. Is it him? Or her? Who can be trusted? Who has a motive? Who will be denounced as a cold-blooded murderer of three?\nPoisson clears his throat and continues his final address. \u201cAnd so, my dear people, the answer is not where we expect to find it. This murderer is not a rational man, no matter how neatly the bodies are arranged. He is a man of singular passion, consumed by an idea that he thinks nobody will understand. He is devoured by his actions, and he is helpless to the memory of it. He will return to the scene to make sense of his many tumultuous feelings. Will he forgive himself if he looks upon this scenario again? Or will his guilt own him? Let us, dear people, find out the answer.\u201d He checks his pocket watch. His timing is, of course, perfection.\n\u201cThe killer is\u2014\u201d he says\u2014\nAnd the Orient Express plunges into a tunnel.\nThe darkness is absolute. There is a scream; then the sound of breaking glass. A moment later the tunnel ends as abruptly as it began, and the early afternoon light streams through the wall of windows to illuminate\u2014\nPeter Millican.\nAnd now Poisson is alone with the killer of dreams. He has found his man.\nThe detective and the murderer observe each other. Eventually, Poisson says, \u201cYou knew it was trap. But you came anyway. I guessed you\u2019d be that sort of person.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t guilt. Or curiosity.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, then, sir?\u201d\nMillican sits down opposite Poisson and examines the dining card selection. \u201cYou\u2019ve got an eye for detail, I\u2019ll give you that. You with the police?\u201d\nPoisson folds his hands over his stomach. \u201cI am merely one of your employees.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps a little more diligent than the rest.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not actually hurting anyone,\u201d says Peter. \u201cThey\u2019re already dead.\u201d\n\u201cYou leave them at the mercy of wild animals.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what the Recess is. The tigers aren\u2019t \u2026 they\u2019re not actual tigers.\u201d\nPoisson remembers his other life, where he watched a training documentary about the dangers of properly constructing a dream so that clients couldn\u2019t fall through the cracks into a terrible jungle. The price of creating only happy dreams in the mind is that the nightmares, the equal and opposite reaction, must be stored somewhere. Poisson understands this. He has had terrible nightmares since his hair began to desert him. In the nightmare his hair regrows, sprouts from his perfectly bald head with such alacrity that it twists around his throat, grows into his mouth and down to his stomach, choking him, choking him. He would not like to live in that reality, particularly if his hair also turned into a tiger and devoured him from the inside out.\n\u201cWhat are they, then?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhy call them \u2018tigers\u2019 if they\u2019re not?\u201d\nPeter hums a song that Poisson does not recognize.\n\u201cTell me where your body is. Let me unplug you, and we can put an end to all this. Surely you\u2019ve seen enough dreams now. You must be ready to travel onward. To whatever\u2019s next.\u201d\n\u201cThe funny thing is, they\u2019re never alike,\u201d says Peter.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cTheir final dreams. You might think everyone just wants a final weekend of debauchery without consequences. Some do, don\u2019t get me wrong. But there\u2019s always a twist. Something you wouldn\u2019t expect. A detail that has to be just so. I\u2019ve never come across any that are exactly alike. I was looking for confirmation.\u201d\nPoisson sighs. Does he have to catch the man and then sit through the interminable confession too? \u201cIs your body in the city? A desert island, perhaps? Give me a clue. I can solve clues.\u201d\n\u201cI was so in love,\u201d muses Peter. He gets up and strolls around the dining car, straightening cutlery, examining wine glasses. \u201cI made Dreamtech for her. I based my dreams on her dreams, my nightmares on her nightmares. And then she left me, and I couldn\u2019t see why anyone should have their dreams any more. Let them all have nightmares.\u201d\n\u201cSelfishness.\u201d\n\u201cDo you insult the chef if you want dessert, Poisson? You\u2019re an idiot. I had decided to give up this game but you rile me. I\u2019ve given you enough clues. Now you can find your own answers.\u201d\nPoisson stares at Peter Millican. Have there been clues? He\u2019s missed them. But he cannot admit to that. If he admits defeat, he\u2019ll go right back to being the Client Officer, attempting to clean up messes and getting nowhere. This reality is so much better.\nHe strokes his bald head. \u201cMonsieur Millican, you have given away everything. Simply allow me to compose my thoughts and I will reveal the location of your body.\u201d\nPeter sits down once more. He is collected, urbane, handsome. He is an adversary to be afraid of. \u201cAny time you\u2019re ready,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m all ears.\u201d\nThe detective and the murderer face each other. The train travels onward.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cI hope we\u2019re all still here in the morning,\u201d says Barbara.\n\u201cIf not,\u201d says Terry, \u201ccan I just say, this has been the best holiday ever. Meeting up with you two \u2014 well, I only wish we could have done it in reality. Soulmates. I don\u2019t use that word lightly.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a great end to a rubbish life,\u201d says Sally softly.\nWe squeeze hands, and say a prayer for you, Peter Millican. You are a great guy. You have been inside our heads, and you knew what we wanted, what we really wanted, all along.\nThe tigers take up a gentle rocking motion, side to side, and start to hum. The jungle birds chirp along in time, and we dream a little dream of you.\nThen the tigers open their mouths and lovingly devour us. They take slow, careful bites, crunching through bones and expectations. We are all delighted to learn there is no pain after all.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nNever waking. Never coming back. Something went wrong, said the Nurse.\nHe\u2019d been informed of the risks. Carted off to a private facility to lie stretched out like a fish until one day he awakes, or Dreamtech gets tired of paying the bill. And they were still no closer to finding Peter Millican. Perhaps they never would.\nThe streets are teeming with people; it\u2019s a late work day for him and the evening crowd forms a line for the theatre adjacent to the Dreamtech facility. It had been a stipulation of Millican\u2019s that the theatre remain intact and operational when he bought out the property. The showbill hasn\u2019t changed since \u2014 it\u2019s a joke amongst the employees \u2014Les Miserables, hundreds of performances. And the theatre has the perfect name. They call it The Glums. Such perfect irony for a place that\u2019s meant to serve up happiness in a dream.\nPerhaps I should quit, the Client Assistant thinks. It\u2019s not a new thought. In his own dreams, he imagines quitting, throwing his written notice into the face of the Client Officer and then jumping out of the window and flying away, up into a perfect blue sky, like Superman. But now the Client Officer is gone.\nHe\u2019ll have to get a new dream.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue24\/3lbe24_story6.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"The worst is my own death.

A brain?\u201d\nThis single tree grows both Bing and Rainier cherries. She is convinced it\u2019s a magic tree but Yuan says the tree was grafted. Apparently, you take a slice of one fruit tree and insert it into a matching incision in a host tree, wrap it with some electric tape, and at some point, the veins will flow together until they share a vascular system, like an ocean. \u201cIt\u2019s all about combining different tissues,\u201d Yuan explains. A chimera tree, Wenjie thinks as she counts the few yellow-pink cherries, dwarfed by the deep red ones. She imagines the head thief doing something similar: take the head of a smart person and put it on the body of a strong person, and suddenly you\u2019ve got a strong smart person without the taxing process of transforming a bundle of cells into a baby then into an adult.\nShe points to one of the ripe, plump Rainier cherries and Yuan plucks it from the branch and places it in her palm. She rolls it softly, feeling for its firmness, before popping it in her mouth. It tastes more like a cherry-flavored Jolly Rancher than a real cherry: saccharine, without much acidity or depth, cheap yet addictive.\n\u201cYou think we can graft a lime tree onto this?\u201d she continues. \u201cTemper the sweetness with acidity.\u201d\nYuan shrugs but doesn\u2019t stop her from trying.\nWenjie pretends she is the head thief, snapping young shoots from a neighbor\u2019s lime tree and trimming its base. She digs her fingernails into a flaking section of the cherry tree\u2019s bark and peels it away, a spry flap revealing a bright green layer of tissue. Then she inserts the lime shoot into the bark and winds tape around and around until the connection point is completely concealed. She will be the best mock head thief, one who won\u2019t leave scarring, not on the neck of a branch, the skin of a human.\nWhen you get a better head, you become a better person, Yuan told her after she confessed to stealing an untouched, still-plastic-wrapped mooncake from the bakery\u2019s dumpster. It had been a white lotus-stuffed mooncake rather than the much-despised salted egg yolk one. She thought she\u2019d receive praise from the rare discovery: one huge moon cake to split between them and even then, the cake was dense enough they\u2019d still be full from half. But Yuan wasn\u2019t the same after the head theft, slapping the cake out of her hands instead of praising her. Before the new head had been grafted onto Yuan\u2019s neck, Yuan let her do anything: collect food from trash cans in the wealthier neighborhoods at night, update their scoreboard of rare finds\u2014sealed jars of sesame butter, a graphing calculator preprogrammed with Tetris, untouched chicken gizzard skewers coated in togarashi\u2014and when Wenjie started skipping school to make up for sleep lost to treasure hunting, Yuan told the school she was sick.\nWenjie carries around the steel shears, cutting multiple branches from the same tree so she has options to choose from. This must be how the real head thief does it: selects from an arsenal of heads and ranks them for irregularities and disease.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make a tree with one hundred different fruits,\u201d she tells Yuan after cutting enough branches to fill her arms up to her chin. She drops them to the ground and spreads them until they\u2019ve covered the grass and she has to tiptoe to avoid snapping them. \u201cAs long as you pick more cherries,\u201d Yuan says before disappearing into their tent propped up by ropes that have begun to fray around the tree trunks. Another thing that changed since Yuan\u2019s head was stolen: Wenjie used to never be left alone because Yuan insisted memories could only be made with others. They did everything together: crawling on hands and knees behind the grocery store at night, searching for fallen coupons for free coconut-egg bread even though only Wenjie could fit her arm under the crates and shelves. Or when they would sneak into the dingy mock-temple that was only a room filled with statues of gods with triangular beards and long, banana-like ears and the pungent scent of incense, and Wenjie would watch Yuan pry open one of the donation boxes, loosen the screws with brute strength, and snatch a wad of cash. But now they don\u2019t adventure around for loose cash-filled boxes or into the nooks and crannies where forgotten things hide. She is stuck picking cherries and Yuan is doing who-knows-what. Yuan even looks different now: a fiery shade of skin tone, a wide mouth that reaches from cheek to cheek, a thin and pointed nose erected like a wall between Yuan\u2019s face. Wenjie knows she shouldn\u2019t doubt: the head thief only replaces stolen heads with better ones, after all. But it has been a long time since she and Yuan ate a pastry plucked fresh from the dumpster, even one without any egg custard filling or scallions, composed only of flour and sugar and air.\nWhen Wenjie finds blood soaking her crotch and polyester pants, at first she thinks she sat on the bag of cherries they\u2019d picked for the orchard owners. Yuan is still sleeping so she quietly sneaks out of the tent to pick another bagful. Maybe Yuan won\u2019t notice, won\u2019t slap her cheek and accuse her of wasting effort and money. But as she reaches for the cherries, the ones weighing the branches down towards the ground like bags of gold, red continues to spread throughout her pants, trickling down her leg and onto the edge of her sock. She presses on her leg, trying to find the wound, but as her fingers climb her thighs, she feels no familiar sting of a cut, as though the blood had just decided to leak. Wenjie drops the cherries onto the dirt and returns to the tent, shaking Yuan awake.\n\u201cThere\u2019s blood,\u201d she says. Yuan stares at the red-now-browning stain. \u201cYou\u2019ve got too much yin,\u201d Yuan replies. And there\u2019s nothing Wenjie can do about it. Yuan explains the blood just needs to come out; if you try to keep it in, you\u2019ll go crazy. You\u2019ll start scraping your stomach empty with a curette, gnawing through onion peels and orange rinds because normal food will feel too soft and delicate, plunging yourself into ice water to remind yourself how to feel cold.\nYuan forbids Wenjie from washing their clothing together, from trespassing onto Yuan\u2019s side of the tent, from grazing Yuan\u2019s hand because right now her blood is poison, a sign of death, and now she will die every month until there\u2019s no more blood left to give, and only then will she have the right amount of blood, pure enough to rinse away all the years of oxidation and rust caked under her fingernails.\n\u201cYou won\u2019t hold my hand?\u201d Wenjie asks. Of course not, is the response. Yuan with the previous head wouldn\u2019t have said no. Old Yuan would\u2019ve laughed and asked to get drunk off the blood together, cultivating Gu with their endless supply of hemoglobin and witchcraft. But now Wenjie can\u2019t ask Yuan to reach the higher branches for her, to drop cherries in her hand and graze fingertips against palm\u2014not until Wenjie\u2019s body stops dying, and she has no idea when that\u2019ll happen.\nThe next night, after a day of stretching and balancing on piles of trash to grab the tallest branch and cast down its fruit, after an evening of stabbing other tree branches into wedges of the cherry tree and mummifying the connections with tape, after Yuan goes to sleep, the head thief visits.\n\u201cWill a new head stop the bleeding?\u201d Wenjie asks. The head thief shrugs. Maybe, depends on the head. \u201cWill Yuan like me better?\u201d Maybe. \u201cWill my current head become dog food?\u201d Maybe.\nShe pulls down her collar so the thief can get a better look at her neck. Yuan isn\u2019t here to tell her it\u2019s bad to expose your neck to strangers\u2014how some people like that sort of thing: thin skin blanketing the spine, like soybean paper wrapping rice, a fragility meant to be protected or broken. Old Yuan never told her to cover up her neck or wear baggy jackets, but rather to tuck her chin toward her chest if someone was trying to choke her, to build her endurance so she\u2019d be ready to outrun anyone.\n\u201cDo you still have Yuan\u2019s old head?\u201d She asks. The thief points to the picked cherries in the bag. Wenjie reaches in and pulls out a handful. She offers the fistful to the thief and drops them into its gaping mouth\u2014there\u2019s no bottom, she notices as she peers down its throat.\n\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to do anything anymore,\u201d she says, sitting on the ground as the thief chews and swallows, downing flesh and seed whole. The head thief nods slowly, as though waiting for Wenjie to fall asleep so it can complete its heist.\nBut she doesn\u2019t\u2014she insists on working through the night, and maybe someday, her productivity will earn Yuan\u2019s praise.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue33\/3lbe33_story2.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"Yuan used to tell Wenjie about the head thief whod snip your head off with shears and replace it with someone else's.

Turnip Smith\nAbout that time Robert found it difficult to sleep at night for fear of the murderer. Daytime was safe and predictable, but night time meant closing your eyes and when the eyes went shut, the brain swung out of control. Dead men walked. Camels flew. Airplanes crashed. Doors talked, and sometimes a misshapen head with one huge watery eye rocked back and forth on a spring like a jack in the box, whispering things in your ears or chasing you with a chainsaw. Robert always awoke exhausted in a puddle of sweat.\n\u201cI hate sleeping,\u201d he told his mother.\n\u201cNonsense, stupid. Sleep is a necessity. Without sleep your head will ache and temples pound like mine,\u201d his mother said. She had huge pasty gobs of suet hanging from her arms and her eyes burrowed down in her puffy, pasta face like squirreled acorns.\n\u201cWell I'd rather never sleep,\u201d Robert said. \u201cI'd sooner just always play with my toys.\u201d\n\u201cIf you play with your toys too much, you\u2019ll never grow up,\u201d his mother said.\n\u201cAnd if you never grow up, you\u2019ll be weak. And if you\u2019re weak, you\u2019ll be like your father. You\u2019ve got to learn that life is serious. Look at how I\u2019ve suffered with my life. You think my life has been spent playing with toys?\u201d\nRobert didn\u2019t know the answer to that. All he knew was that at his home there was a certain word no one ever dared use. However, because Christmas was coming, he could not get toys out of his head. He loved toys and made long wish lists, including fire engines and video games and Chatty Cathies and air rifles and Big Wheels and erector sets.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not any money for such foolishness, dummy,\u201d his mother said. \u201cYou\u2019ll probably get a Slinky. Your father was a lousy provider and we\u2019re his victims.\u201d\n\u201cBut I want so much more than a Slinky,\u201d Robert said. \u201cI want an electric train, a Gumby, a remote control car, and something else, but I can\u2019t figure out what.\u201d\n\u201cJust like you! Someone would have to go to an imaginary toy factory to get all that crap you think you need,\u201d his mother said. \u201cMoney don\u2019t grow on trees you know.\u201d\nAnd then Christmas came. There was only a single candy cane and no lights on the tree and a lone present for Robert. It was a medium-sized present shoddily wrapped in dirty newspaper with no box. Robert eagerly tore open the wrapping. It was a gleaming purple remote-control roadster with an air-scoop engine.\n\u201cOh, oh, this is wonderful,\u201d Robert said, running his fingers along the shimmering metal of the car\u2019s engine, thinking that maybe his mother possibly did after all.\n\u201cWell it\u2019s more than you deserve,\u201d she said, lighting another cigarette, her graying hair flying out in wicked clumps.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most wonderful present in the world,\u201d Robert said. For a few days after Christmas, he slept well enough. The weather was bitterly cold; snow barricaded the streets; windows frosted up from the inside; and Robert anticipated the glorious moment when he would run his car on the driveway. On the 28th the police announced they had arrested a vagrant in connection with the slaying of the Risley girl and a warm front hit so that the streets were wet and free of snow.\n\u201cOK, take that damn car outside now that it\u2019s safe, Robert, and don\u2019t let it get down in the sewer,\u201d his mother said.\nWith rising excitement Robert carried the remote-control box and the purple car to the driveway. There was a wonderful feeling of power as the car surged this way and that at the touch of a finger. Robert had never had such a wonderful toy until a bad thing happened. The Donnelly boy down the street walked by and said something.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a four-eyed, knock-kneed, shit-eating piece of cancer,\u201d the Donnelly boy, who played football and had girlfriends, shouted as he came up the street. He had pounded Robert before, and the threat of his voice distracted Robert long enough that the purple roadster shot the end of the driveway and jumped into the open sewer mouth on the opposite side of the street.\n\u201cGood,\u201d the Donnelly boy shouted when he saw Robert\u2019s car disappear. \u201cBig baby. You\u2019re too damn old to play with toys.\u201d\nRobert kneeled forlornly by the mouth of the sewer, knowing the Donnelly boy was wrong. Robert could hear dangerous water running below and he knew his car was being swept away.\n\u201cHey, Danny Donnelly,\u201d he cried. \u201cHelp me pry the lid off the sewer so I can rescue my car.\u201d\nReluctantly Danny Donnelly boy lent a hand. \u201cIf you\u2019re dumb enough to chase a car down a sewer in the middle of winter, I\u2019ll be glad to help, you bozo,\u201d Donnelly said. \u201cI hope they find you drowned.\u201d\nThe sewer lid popped free with a little tugging, revealing an opening just large enough for a boy to fit down. Below a river of melted snow careened along nastily at the floor of a huge sewer pipe. Robert\u2019s car was not visible.\n\u201cYou\u2019re nuts, you go down in there,\u201d Donnelly said, lighting up a joint.\n\u201cI'm going, \u201c Robert cried.\nDaytime things seldom scared Robert, but plunging into the dark sewer pipe, water rushing beneath his feet was terrifying. He fumbled along, crouching, his feet soaked, his eyes unable to adjust to the dark.\n\u201cSo long, sucker,\u201d the Donnelly boy shouted and with a sinking heart Robert heard the sickening thud of the sewer lid dropped back in place.\n\u201cHey, Donnelly,\u201d he shouted, but there was no answer. Well only one thing to do now\u2026 find the car that had been swept from sight. The sewer tunnel plunged along in clammy darkness then suddenly Robert was falling hard, slamming off both sides of the cylinder; at last he hit bottom. He came to his senses a little groggy.\nClearing his eyes, he realized he was in a huge toy showroom seven times the size of anything he'd ever seen at the mall. ATVs, giant screen videos, BMXs with motors, toys by the hundreds leered at him. He hurried along running his fingers across each new treasure. Then he saw the salesman, a strangely familiar looking dwarf in a gray three piece suit with a huge blind watery eye in the middle of his twisted face.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Robert asked nervously.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not polite to ask a lot of questions, dope,\u201d the dwarf grumbled. \u201cDo you like it here?\u201d\n\u201cYes, a great deal,\u201d Robert said. \u201cBut where is here?\u201d\n\u201cGirl-land, boy-land, wonderful lovely Toyland,\u201d Dwarf said. His voice sounded like when you pulled the string on a Mattel talking toy, and a monkey yammered. \u201cWell what do you want this time?\u201d Dwarf added, blowing his nose on his sleeve.\n\u201cHave I been here before?\u201d Robert said.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool,\u201d the dwarf said. \u201cOf course, you have. Everybody has. \u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d\n\u201cSo what? You were asleep then and now you\u2019re too scared to remember. How do you think the girl died?\u201d\n\u201cThe girl?\u201d\n\u201cOf course the girl, dope. The Risley girl on your next street.\u201d\nRobert shrugged.\n\u201cGod you\u2019re hopeless,\u201d the dwarf said. \u201cCome on stand up straight and decide what you want.\u201d\n\u201cOK,\u201d Robert said eagerly, \u201cthat giant purple remote control car six times the size of the one I used to have. \u201d\n\u201cLousy choice. But take it!\u201d\n\u201cFree?\u201d\n\u201cToo dumb to be real. It\u2019ll cost you Danny Donnelly.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean cost me?\u201d\n\u201cHopeless , aren\u2019t you? Murder, death, off him. That\u2019s what.\u201d\n\u201cMe?\u201d Robert said.\n\u201cWho else, Eleanor Roosevelt? You did a great job on the Risley girl. Do Donnelly the same way.\u201d\nRobert felt uneasy. \u201cI don\u2019t think I should.\u201d\n\u201cThink, schmink. You know you don\u2019t have a choice. Remember you take a free toy and then I own you.\u201d\n\u201cI can't,\u201d Robert said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to.\u201d\nDanny Donnelly was by himself at the hangout where the kids smoked dope in the woods. His eyes were scarlet and he was lying on his back completely gooned. It wasn\u2019t even hard. Robert crept forward with the steel dart with the extended points clutched in his hands, just like with the Risley girl.\nBefore Donnelly could say \u201cWhat the?\u201d Robert shoved the dart in Donnelly\u2019s eye. There was a scream and a sucking sound as Robert yanked the dart free and slammed it in to Donnelly\u2019s other eye. The bleeding was minimal; all hemorrhaging was internal as the punctures mounted. After a half hour or so Donnelly looked like a human Parcheesi board and Robert breathed a sigh of satisfaction, knowing he was done.\nThe new purple car would go sixty mile an hour. Robert would start it in the driveway and it would roar to the dead end of the street, do a 360 on two wheels, and then roar back. Meanwhile police cars were everywhere in the neighborhood. Robert remembered nothing concerning the Donnelly boy only he couldn\u2019t sleep again because of all the other bad things that roared through his mind. It got so bad Robert\u2019s mother made him an appointment with a neurologist. The police came the same day. Robert\u2019s mother met the policeman at the door. She was in her usual mood and was wearing her pink, fuzzy kitten slippers and the tattered gray robe that covered her bulk like bad paint on an old battleship.\n\u201cWe\u2019re canvassing the neighborhood to see if anyone here has any information about the slaying of the Donnelly boy,\u201d the police officer said.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know a damn thing about dead dopers,\u201d Robert\u2019s mother said. \u201cWe\u2019re not trash you know.\u201d\n\u201cWell we\u2019ve been told that you have a son who didn\u2019t get along with the Donnelly boy. We'd like to talk to him.\u201d\n\u201cNo way you\u2019re going to bother my boy without a lawyer. he\u2019s very delicate.\u201d\n\u201cWait, Mom, I\u2019ll talk to them,\u201d Robert said, rushing down the stairs.\n\u201cYou shut up!\u201d his mother said, knocking him back towards the kitchen. \u201cYou\u2019re not talking to a bunch of pigs looking for someone to frame like they did OJ.\u201d\n\u201cI'm sorry you feel that way, ma'am,\u201d the police officer said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to get a warrant and bring the boy in for questioning.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll have representation, you scum do,\u201d Robert\u2019s mother said, slamming the door in the officer\u2019s face. \u201cGod that made my migraine explode!\u201d she yelled at Robert.\n\u201cWhat were you trying to do? You\u2019re going to grow up a weakling loser!\u201d\nIt was that same night that Robert saw the dwarf in his dream. Dwarf said, \u201cI got to talk to you, kid. Use the sewer again.\u201d\nThe rest of the night was pretty awful. Robert kept feeling as though he were Danny Donnelly, darts piercing his skin. Blood pooled in the back of Robert\u2019s throat and he vomited red pus on his pillow. He knew he had to visit the sewer.\nToyland was even bigger and shinier than he remembered from last time. Dwarf was clad in a gleaming Captain Kirk costume. He goosestepped up to Robert and removed his helmet.\n\u201cUsed the sewer again, huh?\u201d Dwarf said. \u201cYou are definitely a slow learner, aren\u2019t you? All you have to do to get here is use your mind, just want to. I thought I explained that last time.\u201d\nDwarf looked a little ridiculous in the half-Shatner mask and tight gold shirt. Cheeks burning with shame from the chewing out, Robert still couldn\u2019t help noticing that Dwarf wasn\u2019t even as tall as he.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really want to come,\u201d Robert said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a prig,\u201d Dwarf said. \u201cEvil is really a lot of fun if you let it. Don\u2019t you get it yet?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Robert said.\n\u201cStand up straight and don\u2019t be such a dunce.\u201d\nSuddenly Robert thought, \u201che\u2019s only little; all I have to do is mash him down and wrestle him.\u201d He made a sudden move to go for Dwarf.\nInstantly a phalanx of gloomy toy soldiers, hundreds of Gumbys, a battery of Slinkys, and thousands of teddy bears vaulted between Dwarf and him with a sudden thump. Meanwhile a firing squad of space-ray and bee bee guns took aim at Robert\u2019s face.\n\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d Dwarf said, peeling a grape and spitting the rind on Robert\u2019s best school shoes. \u201cEverything here moves at my thought. Remember remote control? The golden filament that tethers things is evil. So don\u2019t play goody goody with me. What do you want this time?\u201d\nRobert stared transfixed by a waist-high, gray, wooden elephant with a red blanket on its back and a golden saddle. On the elephant\u2019s blanket right near the shoulder were four golden block letters, perfectly neat. Rapturously, Robert spelled out the word in his mind. He'd never seen anything quite like it before.\n\u201cThat,\u201d he said, nodding towards the elephant.\n\u201cExcellent choice,\u201d Dwarf said. \u201cImported. Well it\u2019s yours, but there\u2019s a job to be done. We\u2019ll rid the world of one more obese, cantankerous slob this time. It\u2019ll be great fun if you let it. I want your mother dead!\u201d\n\u201cNo, I can't!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t pull that choir boy act on me again,\u201d Dwarf said. \u201cRemember Patty Risley? Remember Donnelly? You\u2019re corrupt as hell just like all the rest. Get your ass going!\u201d\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\u201cYou figure it out. You\u2019re no virgin, you know.\u201d\nRobert\u2019s mother sat staring at Hard Copy, a bottle of gin and a box of chocolate turtles on the table beside her. She was wearing a pink slip that revealed every corrupt fold of her huge, gross body.\n\u201cStop staring, you little lech, and bring me my robe,\u201d she said, jerking her eyes from the screen momentarily. \u201cThen get me some aspirin. I\u2019ve got a dandy headache. Kids are a pain.\u201d\nShe hadn\u2019t even noticed Robert was astride the fat, wooden elephant, a glittering toy scimitar in his hand.\n\u201cWhat if I were a murderer, Mother?\u201d he said, his voice sounding much younger than his eleven years.\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me laugh. You couldn\u2019t even murder a rabbit,\u201d she said, her eyes transfixed by the screen. \u201cYou\u2019re a weakling like your father.\u201d\n\u201cWell what if I knew the secret of evil and was powerless to resist then what?\u201d\n\u201cYou talk too much, blabbermouth.\u201d\n\u201cWell suppose I murdered the Risley girl and Danny Donnelly, would you still love me?\u201d\n\u201cShut up and see if you can find me another pack of cigarettes,\u201d his mother said.\nKnowing the whole truth now, Robert suddenly screamed. It was a strange scream compounded of all the world\u2019s jungle-squeeze-toys and squawking infant googaws and clacking BMXs with playing card in the spokes. It began low and shrilled through the house, rattling the windows.\n\u201cLook at me, Mother. Look at me!\u201d he cried, riding into the middle of the room on the magnificent elephant, glittering sword brandished in the air. The elephant galumphed two strides forward and the scimitar whirled and hissed as Robert plunged it downwards with both hands \u2014 under his breastbone and into his own heart.\nMildly upset with the mess in her living room, his mother heaved herself out of the huge chair she spent her days in and waddled to where he lay gasping for life on the carpet,the noble elephant beside him.\n\u201cWhat the hell did you do to yourself now?\u201d she said.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t even care, ever,\u201d Robert said.\n\u201cI\u2019ll call the emergency squad. I\u2019ll tell you, you\u2019re going to wind up in a detention home you keep on like this.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s too late,\u201d Robert said, and then he gave up.\nHis mother stood staring at the boy who lay bloodless on the carpet, a scimitar plunged into his breast, beautiful blond curls lank on his flushed forehead, the intrepid elephant kneeling at his side, then she watched as her son\u2019s face slowly metamorphosed into that of the dwarf, the two eyes merging into one huge blind, milky eye that stared at nothing; and she said to herself, \u201cWhat thee hell! Might as well call 911.\u201d\n\u2022\n\u00a9 1999 H.

In her dreams, the city is pristine and perfect. She is perfect.\nThe architect has a lover who is afraid to sleep. At night, the lover lays her head against the architect\u2019s chest. Instead of breath and pulse, she hears the rumble of high-speed trains.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cThe city is rotten,\u201d she says; she doesn\u2019t turn around.\n\u201cI like the city,\u201d says the architect\u2019s lover, so softly she might not be heard. \u201cIt\u2019s where we met.\u201d\nBut the architect isn\u2019t listening. Her hands sketch forms on the air, rewriting the view with shimmering art deco buildings, glistening fountains, and wide, chilly plazas.\nThe architect\u2019s lover creeps outside to stand beside the architect. She hates visiting the architect here; it\u2019s too high. The wind plucks at her. She doesn\u2019t like seeing the city spread out this way, reduced to brick and wood, stone and smudges of light. Her own apartment is close to the ground, where she can step out the door and feel worn cobblestones beneath her feet.\nSometimes, even though she knows the architect would disapprove, the architect\u2019s lover goes outside barefoot. She stands in her doorway and breathes in the stench of factories, blanketing the city in smoke. She breathes in the crackling, golden scent of fresh bread from the bakery on the corner. She breathes in the rotting geraniums in her neighbor\u2019s window box. But most of all, she breathes in the stink of the river, because once upon a time it smelled like the promise of a new world.\nOn those days, the architect\u2019s lover curls her toes around the worn-smooth cobbles and drinks in the life of all the people who came before her \u2014 every horse\u2019s hoof, every shoeless urchin, every factory-man and whore, every rainfall wearing the cobbles as round as they are now. It makes the city feel alive. It comforts her.\nMore than once, she has tried to show the architect her city, the one she sees with her feet curled around the cobblestones, but the architect only frowns. The architect has plans. The architect\u2019s lover would re-write the city with new-forged memories; the architect would re-write it with glass and chrome.\nThe architect slides her arm around her lover\u2019s waist, drawing her closer to the view, but she\u2019s still looking at the city.\n\u201cOne day this will be beautiful,\u201d the architect says.\nThe architect\u2019s lover looks at the architect instead of the city \u2014 the plane of her cheekbones, the sweeping lines of her neck and throat, the dark spiral of her hair.\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful now,\u201d she says.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIn two weeks, a tower rises where the architect\u2019s hands traced the air, even though there have been no work crews, no scaffolds, no sound of hammers and nails. Like the plans, the architect must have dreamed it, brought it into being by force of will.\nThe architect\u2019s lover cannot remember what stood there before the tower, if anything at all. This makes her weep, sitting alone in a caf\u00e9 near the river, where the architect will not see. The architect\u2019s lover wants to remember everything about the city, imprint it on her bones: here is where she held the architect\u2019s hand, there is where they watched long barges pole down the canal. If she can keep the city from changing, maybe she can keep the architect from changing as well.\nPeople pass the caf\u00e9 where the architect\u2019s lover sits, but no one seems to notice the tower. It has always been there. They take it for granted; this is the way the city is meant to be. When she tries to ask about it, people merely shrug. They walk faster; they look at the architect\u2019s lover with strange, indulgent smiles. They shake their heads before going about their days.\nThe next time the architect\u2019s lover visits, the architect calls her out onto the balcony. She points to the tower that has always been there.\n\u201cYou see?\u201d the architect says, indicating the top of the tower, a pyramid of glass all lit up with giant spotlights and faceted like a jewel. \u201cOne day I\u2019ll buy you a diamond bigger and brighter than that one. I\u2019ll string stars around your waist and wrap moonlight around your throat. I\u2019ll drape you in fur and put pearls and feathers in your hair. You\u2019ll never want for anything.\u201d\nThe architect\u2019s lover shudders; she imagines drowning under all that weight.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThey were both strangers in the city, recognizing in each other someone else who had not yet learned to call it home. They discovered it together, exploring every street, every alley, every rooftop and doorway. As they did, the architect\u2019s lover wrote each location on her heart, remembering the way the architect looked when she touched that lintel, this railing. The architect\u2019s lover never saw the city until she saw it through the architect\u2019s eyes, and now they are inextricably intertwined. After so long adrift, these twin points, architect and city, anchored her. In the secret places inside her skin and her bones, her name for both architect and city is home.\nWhat secret name the architect has for her, the architect\u2019s lover does not know. This, she does know: The architect never learned to name the city home and she will rewrite all the places they\u2019ve ever been together \u2014 the smoky caf\u00e9 where they first met, drinking absinthe and watching bloated corpses float down the river; the crumbling bridge where they shared their first kiss, the architect tasting of heady wine and the architect\u2019s lover tasting of nothing at all; the factory where they first fucked, the rough brick against the architect\u2019s lover\u2019s back, and broken glass crunching under their boots. Even the rotten pier where the boats that brought them both from different places long before they knew each other first landed.\nEven so, the architect\u2019s lover cannot fall out of love.\nAll the places she has written on her heart will vanish. Her heart will remain. But when those places are gone, who will they be \u2014 the architect and the architect\u2019s lover? Who will they be, separate and together? With no history, what hope can there be for their future?\nThe architect\u2019s lover is afraid the architect will rewrite her if she falls asleep. So she stays awake, eating cold, tart plums the color of new bruises. She smokes cigarettes she can\u2019t stand the taste of, and drinks coffee so thick the spoon stands on its own when she forgets it halfway through stirring.\nShe does all these things and tries not to think of the architect\u2019s hands on her body when they fuck, placing causeways in the curve of her hip, a spiral staircase winding around her spine, a domed cathedral to replace her skull.\nShe can\u2019t tell the architect of her fear. She can\u2019t tell her she\u2019s afraid, or she\u2019ll lose the architect even sooner. She is losing her. Has lost her. Will lose her again and again. She wants to lose her, and yet the architect\u2019s lover is afraid of coming unmoored again, losing the only place she can call home.\nSo instead she tries to imagine making herself vast enough to hold a city entire, her arms long enough to encompass bridges and canals, wrapped so tight nothing will ever crumble. Even in her dreams, in the rare moments she lets herself sleep, she fails.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nOne: She replaces her bones with scaffolding. Her eyes become window glass, shattering sunlight. Her jaw sings a bridge\u2019s span, made musical by the tramping of a thousand feet. All through her are tunnels, connecting everything. Her veins are marble. Her foundation stone. Her heart a cavernous station thundering with countless trains. She is vast and contains multitudes. And she is beautiful.\nTwo: She is very young and playing on the river bank with her brother and her cousin. It is summer and they are barefoot, squishing mud between their toes, feeling the wet, green life of fish and frogs and stilt-legged birds. They break off reeds from the shore and whip-thin branches from the overhanging trees, weaving them into impossible, organic structures. She is not the architect yet, in these dreams, but hers are always the strongest buildings. Her brother and cousin are too impatient, their fingers too quick. They splinter the reeds, snap the wood, and throw the wrecks into the sun-glinting water. They don\u2019t want it badly enough. Her constructions can withstand anything, bound by her force of will.\nThree: She is very old, but ageless. Her skin, stretched taut over bone-that-is-not-bone, is so thin the light shines through it. There is metal everywhere she can fit it. She has carved away as many pieces of herself as she can and still walk, still breathe. She has cut windows in her flesh, replaced skin with glass so the delicate structures within, the winding catwalks and promenades, are visible. She is light, so light, but she abhors the body that remains, holding her down.\nAt night, she calls her children to her. They come creeping from the shadows, their fingers bloody from tearing her city apart by day and building it anew as dusk falls. Metal spines protrude through their skin. Electricity sparks in their bones, makes their eyes glow. They never speak, but they crackle. She has given them whips to hold, downed power lines with frayed copper ends. At her bidding, they flay her, drawing blood from her remaining skin. She closes her eyes, cries ecstasy from a throat clogged with emotion. They are so perfect, her beautiful children, but it is never enough.\nShe is never enough.\nFour: In her house near the river, she lies snugged tight between her brother and cousin, breathing in their dreams. Elsewhere in the house, her mother, father, and uncle snore. The door bursts open, shatters, raining splinters. Her family, all of them, is dragged from their beds, pushed barefoot into the snow.\nShe can see her breath as they are marched, all in a line, to the river and forced out onto the frozen surface. Under the snow, the ice is impossibly blue, and under the blue, the water is impossibly black. She is separated from everyone but her mother, who grips her hand so tight their bones grind together, and refuses to let go. There are other families, nearly the whole village, teeth chattering, shivering, confused. One man protests, and a soldier in his warm coat and fur hat breaks the man\u2019s nose with the butt of his gun. The man makes a choking noise. He spits blood on the ice, and one yellow-white tooth. He doesn\u2019t protest again.\nOne of the soldiers wears a star on his hat. He barks a command in a language she doesn\u2019t understand, and two of his men go to either end of the shivering line. They walk slowly, with their guns drawn, and shoot every third person they come upon.\nOne, two, three. Crack. One, two, three. Crack. Her father, uncle, and cousin are sixth, eighteenth, and twenty-first in line. Her mother is thirtieth, and she is thirty-first.\nEach bullet is the sound of the ice cracking, her heart breaking, the feel of her mother\u2019s cold-chapped hand grinding against her bones then letting go as the force of gravity and the terrible color of blood upon the snow pull her down.\nHer brother survives. She survives. The solider with the star on his hat lays a heavy hand on her shoulder. He leans forward and breathes in her face, against her ear. His breath, the only hot thing on the frozen lake, smells of sausage and cheap whiskey.\n\u201cGo,\u201d he says. \u201cGo, and take your brother with you. I want you to remember. I want you to carry this moment with you wherever you go.\u201d\nThere are tears on her lashes, freezing in place. She will never let them fall. They are perfect, inverted globes, holding the last image of her family. If they fall, they will shatter, and her family will be lost forever.\nThis is what the architect dreams.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe architect recruits an army of children, urchins with dirty fingers. The architect\u2019s lover sees them in the shadows of old bridges, chipping away fragments of old stone. She sees them in the streets, hurling those chunks of stone through dirt-streaked windows, exploding brick dust from ancient buildings, hastening decay. She sees them digging between the cobbles, pulling them like teeth, prying between ancient boards until they snap. Their fingers are everywhere.\nShe listens to the architect\u2019s plans. She listens to the trains run beneath the architect\u2019s skin when she sleeps. The city will never be finished, never be done. By night the children will build it up, by day the children will pull it down, and put new, shining structures in its place when the moon rises again.\nThe city will never be complete. The architect will never be complete.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nTo the architect\u2019s lover, the river smells of promise, a particular promise that smells of her mother\u2019s skin \u2014 fried onions, boiled cabbage, and harsh soap.\nTo the architect, the river is the smell of sickness. It is the feel of her brother\u2019s fevered skin under the palm of her hand. The river is the color of his eyes, glazed, muddy silt from its bottom occluding his sight. It is the sound of him parting blood-cracked lips at the end, rattling out one last breath, and calling her by her mother\u2019s name. It is the memory of him surviving the ice, and dying \u2014 as so many others did \u2014 on the refugee-choked boat carrying them to a new life, a new shore.\nThe architect is determined she will stitch the river closed. Her thread will be iron and steel, binding up the city\u2019s wounds, sealing her brother\u2019s ghost underneath its skin like a bruise, where it needs must fade.\nSometimes the architect likes to imagine she never touched down on the city\u2019s shore. When her brother died, she climbed up on the rail of the boat, crowded with so many stinking refugees, and let herself fall into the churned, muddy water. She sank, rag doll arms and legs drifting loose around her, hair trailing like weeds. She breathed out and out, silver bubbles rising toward the surface, the only bright and beautiful thing in all the muck. She did not jump, but sometimes she wishes she did. Sometimes, even though she knows it is not true, she convinces herself she did jump. The river swallowed her whole. Some other girl, a drowned girl, a ghost, entered the city in her place.\nAt her core, who the architect truly is, is different. She is still under water, still exhaling, watching those bubbles rise. She is waiting. And one day soon, she will breathe in, light, perfect, and stripped clean. She will breathe in. And wake.\nShe tries to tell her lover these things, but she knows her lover doesn\u2019t hear them. Somewhere, somehow, they lost their way. They met in one city, and somewhere along the way, they diverged. They look at the city now, and they see different things. The architect wonders if she can ever build a bridge strong enough to pull her lover across. And if she can\u2019t, what will happen to them, then?\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIs that the place where she met the architect? Or was it over there? What of the factory, the stone bridge? What of the taste of the architect\u2019s skin, smoky with the factory\u2019s ghosts, sweat-slick beneath her lover\u2019s lips? What of absinthe cradled on the architect\u2019s tongue, and their hands held palm to palm \u2014 so tight \u2014 bone to bone? So tight they will never let go. Where are the echoes of their heels cracking in rhythm, one, two, three, as they run from one place to the next, running wild into the future?\nThe architect\u2019s lover doesn\u2019t recognize herself anymore. She doesn\u2019t know where she fits \u2014 not on the streets, where cobbles no longer rise to meet the arches of her feet; not against the architect, where sharp juts of bone meet her fingers in place of the soft hollow of a throat, the gentle curve of a hip, or the warm swell of a breast.\nShe drinks and she smokes until her memories blur, until their edges round and grow soft like the scarcely-remembered thousand-year cobble stones. The architect\u2019s lover shouts at strangers, her words slurring as she tells them of factories and piers and bridges that never existed.\nShe tells them of home.\nWhen she slips up and says she is the architecture\u2019s lover, not the architect\u2019s, no one corrects her.\nShe is a ghost, in love with a city.\nAnd in time, because she is afraid and she doesn\u2019t know how to fall out of love, the architect\u2019s lover takes home a beautiful boy whose name she can\u2019t be bothered to remember. She fucks him precisely because it means nothing. Smoking still more cigarettes, eating chilled and bruised plums, watching him sleep, she is terribly afraid she\u2019ll marry him one day. Still never knowing his name, the architecture\u2019s lover will use up her body bearing the beautiful boy\u2019s children. Children who will become the monsters of the architecture\u2019s dream.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe architect\u2019s lover remembers her mother putting her on a boat. There were so many boats in those days, all leaving from different places, but all traveling to the city \u2014 a place of promise, a place of dreams. She remembers clinging to her mother\u2019s skirt, sobbing and not wanting to let go as her mother\u2019s hands \u2014 red and blistered from washing \u2014 urged her up the wooden gangway.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a better life,\u201d her mother told her. \u201cYou\u2019ll have opportunities I never had, things I can\u2019t give you. You\u2019ll be happy there, in time. Promise me you\u2019ll try.\u201d\nShe remembers gripping the ship\u2019s rail so hard her knuckles turned white, leaning out over the churning water, waving and straining her eyes until her mother was only a vanished speck on the horizon. Landing on the city\u2019s shore didn\u2019t take the pain away, but stepping from the boat\u2019s swaying deck onto firm land once more, the architect\u2019s lover straightened her spine, keeping her promise to try. Determined to make her mother proud.\nThis is not the city she once called home.\nThis city is hostile. It is like the place she came from, on a boat, so long ago, a place that pushed her out, not wanting her anymore. It does not love her. It barely knows she\u2019s alive.\nAnd yet, still, she cannot fall out of love.\nThe architecture\u2019s lover looks at the beautiful boy whose name she doesn\u2019t know, and tries to love him. Silent tears run down her cheeks; she doesn\u2019t remember why.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHer skin is planed clean, scraped thin. Still, it is too heavy for her bones. But there is time, she knows. This is only the beginning.\nThe architect shades her eyes, and looks toward what was once the river. People stride along what are no longer banks, small as ants from up here. They are laughing, smiling. Women, sleek in cool silk the color of her towers. Men, in crisp suits the color of ice cream that will never melt. Their teeth are impossible in the sun. They don\u2019t remember a life other than this one. She has made it so.\nEveryone should have the luxury of forgetting the times when they weren\u2019t as happy as they must be now.\nStill, something tugs at the edges of the architect\u2019s mind. There is a ghost in the city. The shadow of towers, spewing smoke, and the memory of a kiss, and salt-tasting skin against her lips haunt her mind. Before her marble skin, before the columns of her spine, the tension bridge of her jaw, before the diamond pane windows of her eyes, wasn\u2019t she someone else? Wasn\u2019t there someone who knew her as she was, and loved her just the same?\nThere, amid the ant-bustle on the once-shores, is a lone girl. Her feet are bare and spattered with mud. She is looking straight at the architect, across all the distance, and the people part around her like water breaking around a stone. Like she isn\u2019t there.\nThe architect wonders: Is that her? Or someone she used to know?\nEven though she can\u2019t see them from her balcony, the architect knows: The girl\u2019s eyes are the color of stirred silt, and blue ice. There are weeds in her hair. She raises her hand \u2014 a drowned girl, waiting to breathe, waiting to rise from the river and come ashore \u2014 and waves to the architect, but she does not smile.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nShe goes toward the water, some vague memory pulling her. But the map written on her skin is muddled. The streets, everything she thinks she knows, has been re-written.\nThe architect\u2019s lover is looking for someone, but she doesn\u2019t know who. No one looks familiar here. Except\u2026\nExcept there is a girl, standing and looking across the water. It is a girl the architecture\u2019s lover almost knows. The girl has eyes like silt and ice. They remind the architect\u2019s lover of home.\nThe architecture\u2019s lover raises her hand, catching the girl\u2019s attention. The girl looks at her, and the architect\u2019s lover falls to her knees. A name catches in her throat and stalls. She can\u2019t remember. She weeps, and doesn\u2019t know why. In her mind, there is one word, echoing persistently and meaning nothing: Home.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSoon the city will be perfect. She will tear it down and rebuild it until it is so.\nThe architect turns. She does not raise her hand to the girl on the shore. Or the weeping woman on her knees by the girl\u2019s side.\nThe architect goes inside. And she does not say goodbye.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue24\/3lbe24_story1.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"She is a city haunted by a ghost.

The first snow has planted her womb \u2014 her eyes have turned glacier slick, and her fingers skitter like sleet down Hundhor\u2019s ruff. An ice-baby is certain, come deep-winter, and she will need a husband to keep her warm.\nShe takes my frosted hand in hers and holds tight despite the silvered trails that creep up her arm from mine. \u201cI wish you could have danced with me.\u201d\n\u201cNext winter,\u201d I say, and pull my hand away. It crackles, pinprick shards casting adrift and gathering like loess on the stiffened bearskin crusted to my frozen legs.\n\u201cNext winter,\u201d she says, her voice quiet.\nIt is a lie we speak every summer\u2019s death, and every summer\u2019s death it feels less true than the one before.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI drag myself to the hearth entry and peer between the layered hides. The wind bites into my flesh, and the hoarfrost creeps a finger farther along my cheeks. But I must watch, and she must know I am watching.\nBeneath ice-sharpened skies, my hearth sister dances with Hundhor. No snow falls upon them \u2014 an ill omen. For a moment, I dream she throws Hundhor\u2019s hide to the ground and runs to me, her ceremony incomplete. Together, we birth the frozen thing deep in her womb and I care for it as though it were my own.\nBut no. When the dance is done, she wraps her husband\u2019s arms about her shoulders, and the slickness of her eyes softens. They retire to their new hearth, his great paws enveloping her.\nHundhor offers her the one thing I no longer can. Warmth.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI do not want to see the crackling shard cradled in her arms, the purple iridescence of its hunger, or the green glaze that signals its other needs. I do not wish to see her ice-baby.\n\u201cReturn to your husband,\u201d I say. \u201cMy hearth is closed to you.\u201d\nMy heart cracks, mirrored by the cracking of my womb. I set my hand to the winters-old bulge of my belly where the dead ice has rimed my flesh smooth, but there is no further movement.\nNo, my hearth will remain closed until summer forces itself through winter\u2019s cracks. Until all the ice-babies have melted, the low whistles of their wailing lost to the first thaw.\nIt will be a long wait.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nOutside, women\u2019s laughter and the whistling of ice-babies fill the air. The ice has not yet tipped my ears, so I cannot close out their voices.\nI stare unblinking at the bearskin worn thin and blocked in ice beneath me, a river of fur trapped in perpetual stillness. I do not remember his name, my failed husband.\nIt is forgotten along with the intended name of the dead thing still trapped within my womb.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cPlease,\u201d she says through the skins of my entry, \u201cjust hold him.\u201d\nWinter seeps from the soil, but I am closed to the growing warmth. It is easier being ice than flesh.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d she says again, \u201cjust for one summer\u2019s turn. Just for one sun\u2019s passing.\u201d\nI refuse to answer. She has Hundhor now \u2014 let him hold the ice-baby. Let it melt in his paws while she weeps. Had she not left me, I would have cared for it. And for her. Now she will lose the only thing she loves to the thaw.\nPerhaps it is cruel, but there is too much ice in my heart to care.\nIt is difficult to breathe, there is so much ice in me.\nI miss her smell.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI tremble, and the hoarfrost shivers from my flesh. But even as it flakes away, my dead womb builds it anew, silver trails spiking in snowflake patterns. I tremble harder, then scream and shake until summer\u2019s breath explodes past the ice of my lungs and warm air scrapes my throat.\nWith a snap, I break my legs free of my failed husband\u2019s fur. I shove aside my entry hides and drag myself through the thaw slush and toward the glacier\u2019s mouth. Ice bleeds in my wake.\nI find her, stiff and naked and purple-lipped, in the glacier\u2019s mouth. Beside her, her ice-baby gleams black, its edges melting despite the glacier\u2019s protection.\n\u201cShhh,\u201d I say, and hug it to my breast. It whistles between shades, from black to green to purple to blue. Its edges harden as the ice of my womb crackles outward. Hoarfrost turns our flesh to stars.\n\u201cShhh,\u201d I say again, and start the slow drag homeward.\nI will make sure this ice-baby lives, through this summer and through every summer after.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue22\/3lbe22_story4.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"When the first snow falls, it burns.

McDermott","hostname":"3lobedmag.com","date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000","categories":"","tags":"","id":null,"license":null,"comments":null,"text":"North, I keep on, but there\u2019s no way to know how far I walked before I stopped to rest on this lump of sand instead of that one. I need to rest to keep walking with these old, uncertain bones. When I\u2019m ready to move again, I crawl a little, and wait for my legs to work right below me. When I can\u2019t walk anymore, I drink my own blood from my boots and joints. I was not put together well, nor will I ever be again.\nI do not know how many days there were before this, but it has only been a few days while I walked, and then it was night, and I slept sometimes during the night. Then it was day again and I kept on, where my hand still leads me.\nMy old right hand is still mine. It was my first trade.\nMy legs are shorter than I remember and it is hard to walk on them when they are this worn down. The sand slips through the cracks of very old boots. I\u2019m bleeding somewhere in there, but most of it stays in my boots and I can sip it later when I rest. It\u2019s all I have to drink.\nLet this body be numb and unknown to me. There was little I could do about it in the middle of a desert. I licked what I could reach of my blisters and sores and ill-fashioned joints, drinking back my own fluids. It hurt, but it had to be done.\nAt night, the sand still held the heat from the long afternoon. My bare chest shivered in the frigid desert wind. My feet cooked inside of my boots. I walked and walked licking the blood from my chin.\nA wound from a sand lizard.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI couldn\u2019t tell the three men apart and I didn\u2019t know what to think about that. I thought she was beautiful, and I thought quite a lot about that. Maybe she was like them, but better at trading, or maybe she had never traded for anything in her life and that\u2019s how she was so beautiful. It\u2019s hard to tell with people of the north when you haven\u2019t been around them all your life.\nAt the time, I picked grapes during the day and slipped back into the vineyards after dark when no one was around. I sold the night grapes to other travelers before shuffling off, exhausted, to sleep at the edge of the fields until the overseer whipped me awake. I was saving up for passage to the mountains I had seen on a map halfway across the world. I was going north, halfway home, to the mountains.\nI had heard tales of cities carved from ice and marble in the north all the days of my life. I had only ever known the salt marsh and swamps and rocky hills above the lakes, where I had grown up almost completely alone but for my mother and an old sailor.\nI had high hopes when I saw the four newcomers. I followed them to a sailor\u2019s tavern, and after a while found a place to be with her alone, and I mentioned it to her in the tavern, that I wanted to go north to the mountains halfway home, as soon as I could work up enough and save.\n\u201cI know a few people that might help you over the mountains,\u201d she had said. Her eyes creased beyond my shoulder.\nI turned and saw a dead rat, smashed into the floor. I hadn\u2019t noticed it before. She whispered a prayer to a god or goddess I did not know to aid the rat that I would have killed if I\u2019d seen it first.\n\u201cYou wish to escape this filthy place,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should all see Great Valion\u2019s Gates before we die. It\u2019s such a beautiful city, cut from white marble and ice by master carvers and there\u2019s so many winter roses growing in the ice. You can travel together with my friends,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re parting ways here.\u201d\nI frowned at that. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been there before,\u201d she said, as if that was some kind of answer to the question I was asking.\nI felt the north star even indoors and drunk. I knew exactly where it was above my head. I knew where north was in a hand that I had traded with an old sailor.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nA large lizard lounged on my chest like a lover. It had yellow eyes with the expressionless languor of a lizard. As good a friend as any I had met lately, I thought. We stared at each other with faces unreadable to each other.\nThen, for the reasons known only to lizards, it had been waiting for me to look at it before its feast began. It finally opened its mouth. The long tongue stretched over my face, licking at the salt of my boils and blisters. The gnarled head turned sideways, and it chose the nearest flesh. The lizard took slow bites of my chin.\nI couldn\u2019t feel the pain, yet, or move away.\nI saw the bloody teeth. The lizard\u2019s casual prongs upon my flesh were of a lazy, summer lunch, just before a siesta. The forks came down and poked the sides of beef. The diner was alone on his sunswept balcony, and ate with a methodical quiet of purpose. The meat didn\u2019t feel, and didn\u2019t scream, but the meat wanted to very much jump and scream and fight back.\nI had drunk too much and it had been drugged. My body was numb and had taken so long to wake up for me because much of it was new to me. My right hand was not new. The chewing was a distant pain, like feeling something noxious on the breeze. It should hurt more. Everything should hurt more. It would when the body woke up to itself in full.\nI regained my hands slowly. I lifted the numb clubs with sleepy fingers and I pushed at the beast upon my chest. Then, my fingers could hold on a little. Then they could hold on very strong. I could sit up slowly with this slowly wriggling beast in my powerful arms.\nI choked the lizard.\nMy little friend wiggled and kicked and scratched at me but not for very long. I watched the golden light in his eyes fade to numb.\nI poked at my shredded chin and thought about bandaging myself with a shirt. I picked up the lizard\u2019s cadaver instead.\nAt the very least I had something to eat out here, and something else to think about while I walked and drank. Blood would be my only water for a long time in these long, hot dunes.\nI took my shirt off. I once had good leather worker\u2019s clothes that fit me like a glove after so long in the vineyards, but now all I had was a white shirt and burlap leggings. I wrapped the shirt over my skull to keep the worst of the sun from striking my head. I couldn\u2019t remember if I had hair as I was traveling with the three men or not. I don\u2019t think I did. I didn\u2019t have it now.\nI held the corpse of the lizard by the tail. I slung it across my back like a small sack, and ate it slowly over a long day from the face to the skull. The bones were inedible and I left them behind me for the sand to devour.\nI walked.\nWhen the sun fell to my left, I sat down and prayed to the gods of the north I did not know.\nNothing happened. The moon rose was all. Maybe that was a miracle tonight.\nI looked up at the white crescent like a goddess\u2019 eye closing to me.\nThe hot sand still burned through my boots when I walked at night. At least the night air cooled my body. I had never been to a desert before. I had heard stories. I didn\u2019t know which desert was beneath my feet, but there were many made new after the god had pushed the continents together.\nMy back wearied of the dead weight of my food so I ate much of my lizard raw, even though I did not hunger for it. Whosever stomach this was, it kept the rancid flesh down. I\u2019d rather eat the meat raw than cook it. I didn\u2019t want to lose any liquid that could be considered wet enough to drink. The wetter an organ was, the better it was, no matter how awful it tasted.\nI walked all night, always north.\nWhen the peeking light of the sun appeared on the far side of the sand dunes, I sat down. My skin had bubbled like cooked meat, then fell into strips of frayed, thin, dry leather. I was covered with a thick layer of sweat-congealed sand. At least the sand helped keep the skin from bleeding more.\nOn my back, I tried to cover as much of my body as I could against the sunlight with the shirt, but it wasn\u2019t long enough to protect both my head and my body. I tried rolling in sand to get it to clump on me. I closed my eyes. I dreamed of Tavis, and the sound of the ocean water crashing into the mighty cutter ships that docked there, looking for grapes and wine.\nI grew up near a salt lake beach south of Tavis, where the marsh is thick and every building collapsed into the marsh. The sailors that came told half-witted stories about cursed ships, never allowed to return to land. They talked about their glorious journey to Galesberg before the shift like a myth. They talked of the great god of the continents, who had pulled the lands together on a whim \u2014 perhaps, to impress a mortal woman, or to answer a pious prayer of a sick child who wished to visit Galesberg. The story varied, but this was universally known: The continents came together one day in a terrible earthquake everywhere in the world, and everyone says the god that did it was running over the land, smiling and pushing the rocks together like a luminescent giant.\nMy eyes bulged wide at their tales of storms and monstrous currents, and horrific serpents that had once scraped the sides of the salt-eaten cutter ships when the shift came and everyone and everything had to adjust. People died that day in the thousands, and in the days afterward. But, the god had done no more re-arranging after that, and we all had to do our best to move on. The maps were re-drawn. The people all prayed for things to hold still a little while more this time.\nAnd I lived on this long beach at Tavis in the quiet afternoons after studying in the temple all morning. I sat with the old sailor. He wore the same sun-drenched red vest and woolen pants every day of his life. He stank of coarse sea salt from the lake where he fished during the day with spears and nets, wading out into fishkills and trapweirs.\nAnd there I learned the north star.\nHe pointed up at the sunlit sky through an all-day drunk. \u201cSee that up there,\u201d he said, \u201cDo you see that?\u201d\nI looked up where he pointed. I saw only blue. \u201cWhat?\u201d I said.\n\u201cWhen the sun sets, that\u2019s where the north star comes out.\u201d He dropped his hand on me like an anchor dropping. His voice rose with the repetition of his myth of youth. \u201cWe went all the way to Galesberg because I could find that damned little candle-point even on the sunniest, cloudiest, ugliest, prettiest day and night. I sleep, and my hand just points.\u201d He lifted his hand and shoved it into my face. \u201cIt just points!\u201d\nI said nothing to him.\nHe stared at his hand a moment. He took a drink.\nHe lifted his hand again, towards me. \u201cYou can take my hand with you!\u201d he said, \u201cThen you can sail the sea anywhere and find that stinking star.\u201d\n\u201cWill you tell me a story about the lost sailor, and give me some of your wine? I replied, in my sweetest boy voice.\n\u201cTake my hand,\u201d he shouted, \u201cI\u2019ll trade you yours for it!\u201d\nHe took out a sharpened white whale-bone.\n\u201cI like my hand,\u201d I said, \u201cYours is too old. Mother says I\u2019m too young.\u201d\nHe shook his head at me and swayed back and forth. \u201cBut my hand has experience. You\u2019ll still live forever. We both will, if we are wise traders, and get better than we lose,\u201d he said, \u201cbut think of this: You\u2019ll always be able to find the north star. And I will get a hand that I can finally teach something new. I want to do new things. I don\u2019t want to think about Valion anymore. He lifted his blade. \u201cIf your mother yells we can trade back. It\u2019s a crime you don\u2019t know what it feels like to have a homeland.\u201d\n\u201cMother will yell,\u201d I said. \u201cTell me about Valion, and maybe I\u2019ll feel it anyway.\u201d\n\u201cValion is a jewel in a blighted world, but you\u2019ll never know!\u201d\nWe did trade one day, after mother walked on beyond her own, tired skin. I stayed with him a while afterward, and we traded then. It was my first trade, with the only other northerner I had ever known. He never wanted more than that.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nFull sun.\nI tried to pray. I couldn\u2019t. My head was swollen in the daylight heat, and cluttered up the ancient words. My tongue felt like a dry mushroom in my mouth, and refused to speak at all. My chin gnawed on my exposed nerves like the lizard\u2019s angry ghost. I squinted my eyes. My deep red skin cracked and screamed at me. White continents of peeling skin cracked and fell off my body and became sand.\nDid I fall asleep again? I don\u2019t know. If I did, I dreamed in pink. My eyelids draped over my eyes, and I saw only the color of my skin in the sun. I saw only pink. I thought of nothing. I dreamed of nothing. I felt everything.\nWhen I didn\u2019t see any more pink, I saw black. I opened my eyes, and my hand pointed at the sky. I dragged my tired bones together and discovered my feet again, beneath me.\nOnly sand.\nI sat back down.\nI drew letters in the sand with my pointing hand, the one I had only traded once. I wrote these lines out for someone to read, whoever listens. The wind comes and blows the little valleys of my words into a smooth dune surface again. I write and I pray. I pray and I write. And the sand peels away my skin, my voice, my words.\nWhat else to write before my sinews crackle and snap with thirst, oh quiet Gods?\nMy hand writes. It writes well. Here it is before you: my miraculous message from the sands.\nI do not need the north star. I need a different miracle from my hands. I need help. Please, hands, bring me water. Please, grant me the gift of water. Let a rainstorm come. I will lie down and open my mouth and let the cool drops pour over my naked body.\nI will write the words.\nWater. Water. Water.\nHills and valleys full of lazy streams and fat rivers.\nYet, I have the voice of wind, and no merciful God or Goddess hears this sand and wind.\nIn Tavis, the gorgeous woman whispered to her Goddess more than she ever spoke to me. She whispered with the throaty rapture of the pigeons, and she was praying for nothings. She prayed for the soul of a dead rat, mashed into the corner of a tavern. She touched a beggar and prayed for rain to clean his face. She prayed for a good hair day in her morning hand-mirror. I listened, and lounged in her bed. I had never known a woman from the north countries before, and wondered if it was supposed to be different or better or worse than the port women of the south. I wanted to know. She seemed willing to show me.\nA firestorm rolled in from the marsh, harmless and hot. Tongues of tiny flames threaded out from the sky, fizzling like baby sparks where they fell into the damp ground. She prayed that no sparks would land on a dry rot plank and burn a house down, but they rarely did that. They came with the rainstorms, in the summer.\n\u201cThe gods ignore us in a firestorm. It is a devil\u2019s reply to prayers,\u201d I said, because I was looking for anything to say at all.\n\u201cThe gods always listen,\u201d she replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I keep praying. We should always pray because the spiritual lack inside of us defines us no matter what we wear. Pray because the emptiness is what remains when everything else can be made new.\u201d\nI touched her hand, and prayed for her love. I listened to her speak about her religion because I was looking for an opportunity to close the space between our faces.\nRed firelight drifted all around her pale skin. It died upon our bodies like tiny chigger bites.\nWe pressed close in evening twilight. The bees buzzed through the fields of thickened grapes after the firestorm passed. They drifted through the open window of our room, and landed upon our naked skin. We watched, allowing them to soak up the sweetness from her body, for they meant no harm to us.\nShe stared off behind me somewhere. I had my eyes half-closed so I could live in the bottled-flower smell of her long neck. I heard her soft whispers, and I knew they weren\u2019t for me.\n\u201cWhat are you praying for?\u201d I said.\n\u201cThe bees,\u201d she said, \u201cThe poor, ignorant bees that lick my perfume.\u201d\n\u201cI think the bees are smarter than we are,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI know they\u2019re not. Look at them,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen you come here tomorrow morning to pick the grapes, they will sting at your hand.\u201d She tapped my shoulder and pulled back from me. \u201cAnd you! You will strike at the bees because you are ignorant, too.\u201d\n\u201cI am?\u201d I said.\n\u201cYour hands pick the grapes,\u201d she said, \u201cand the bees do not see that without men to pick grapes, there would be no vines at all.\u201d\n\u201cThe bees are the worst part of it,\u201d I said, \u201cthem and the sun. I hate the sun.\u201d I look past her golden hair to the grapes in the twilight. \u201cI wish we could work at night, but the overseer thinks we steal his grapes.\u201d\n\u201cYou have admitted to me that you do steal grapes. Without the bees, there would be no grapes,\u201d she said, \u201cso you strike your own livelihood.\u201d\n\u201cThere are always more bees,\u201d I said, \u201cbut there aren\u2019t always enough hands.\u201d\n\u201cTake mine,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I pulled back from her. My hands drifted away from her white, linen dress like wind over drapes.\n\u201cI will trade with you,\u201d she said. She took my wrists, and lifted my hands up. \u201cMy hands won\u2019t strike the bees. I will take yours somewhere else. Then the poor bees will be safe at least from you.\u201d\n\u201cYou have the hands of a woman,\u201d I said, \u201cand if I took them, they\u2019d whither under the heat of the workman\u2019s sun.\u201d I pulled my hands away. I stepped back from her. \u201cThese hands I have would swing like pendulums at the end of your arms. You would no longer be beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cThen,\u201d she said, \u201cjust for a little while?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cPlease?\u201d She cocked her head and her eyes sparkled in the angle of the fading sun. \u201cFor the poor bees,\u201d she said, \u201cand just for a while.\u201d\n\u201cPeople in this land do not trade hands,\u201d I said.\n\u201cIt will just be for a little while,\u201d she said.\nI felt the pull of my withered hand, to the north. Always north.\nPeople in the southern country try to stay together for weeks, months, and years after spending a long evening in a tavern room. It was not the way of the northerners. It was not our way. She told me I should go or stay, but not to expect anything if I wouldn\u2019t trade with her.\n\u201cBut you\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d I said.\n\u201cBeauty is for the young,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of beauty.\u201d\nMaybe she was the daughter of one of the three men. Maybe that is why they would not trade with her. My mother said that trade was never done between the flesh of a family, or those who know you when you\u2019re young. Trading is an act for equals.\nIn the morning the men had heard that I wanted to go to the old cities of the north, to Valion beyond the mountain of Petronus. I had to choose between her, indifferent to me and eating grapes that I had stolen at great personal risk, and these three hard men who could take me to the city I had heard about all the days of my life.\nThree tall men whom she hugged like brothers when we left her in Tavis, and me whom she kissed on the nose and told me I had a beautiful nose and maybe when I returned she would take it from me.\nOver a campfire, the men looked exactly the same.\nI asked them if they were brothers.\n\u201cNo,\u201d said one of them, \u201cwe just traded too much together. We all look the same because we traded too much.\u201d\n\u201cDo any of you have a name?\u201d I said.\nAnother one frowned. \u201cI think I used to be called Claret,\u201d he said, \u201cSomebody called me that once. After a while it\u2019s hard to remember. Mirrors don\u2019t work for us. Fortunetellers won t even talk to us to try and figure it out.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the first, \u201cI was Claret. You tore my face off once and I turned into a monster and that woman from Valion called me Claret because I chewed off her first leg.\u201d He touched his nose, and pointed across the fire at his companion\u2019s face. \u201cYou and I traded noses and I got my face back and I felt human again. I\u2019m Claret. You are someone else entirely.\u201d\n\u201cBut who?\u201d he said, \u201cWhat are our real names now?\u201d\n\u201cWho cares,\u201d said the third, \u201call I know is I still have one hand left that has always been mine. This right hand is all mine.\u201d\n\u201cCan it find the north star?\u201d I said. I took another long drink from the skein of wine.\n\u201cSometimes, it can find anything,\u201d said the third. He took the wine from me, and sipped. \u201cAnything, I want, it can find sometimes. Just not always when I want it. It\u2019s good to hold on to yourself as long as you can.\u201d\nWe drank too much. I drank too much and listened. They talked. We passed around the same skein of wine. I drank and drank. They sipped. Maybe they didn\u2019t drink too much. They talked of trading their souls for new souls like it was as easy as trading cloaks. There was a theological debate in Valion. They had disagreed with the woman. This is why they separated.\nOur eyes swirled with the same secrets from the same skein. But I drank too long each time. I took more than my share. I was not an even trader. I got greedy. I talked to learn the limits of things, and didn\u2019t know what I had never been taught by my mother and the other northerner in Tavis. I fell asleep, and then I woke up with a lizard on my chest under a desert sun.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMy right hand returns to the dirt and writes.\nI wonder what else they took from me. I should sit with them at their fire again, if I meet them. \u201cMy name is Lanval,\u201d I should say, \u201cI still remember my name when my mother gave it to me. Now tell me what pieces of me you have taken that are mine. I do not begrudge them to you, for I was not a good traveling companion, but I would still like to know.\u201d Instead of killing them while they sleep, I will write my name on all the things they took in magic ink that never fades. Then, I will let them live, with my name wherever they look and that will be worse than death, because they will all lose what is left of their old selves.\nMy right hand writes in the dirt, and I have no hand-mirror to look upon the face that looks back that is not mine. I cannot pray, either, except for this.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nShe told me I had gold-flecked blue eyes like solar eclipses. She kissed my eyebrows.\nI pulled back from her kisses. \u201cWhere are you from, exactly? What city?\u201d\n\u201cI am from Valion.\u201d She tried to kiss my eyebrows again.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that,\u201d I said. \u201cI just thought you had visited it, once.\u201d\n\u201cYou are from Valion, too,\u201d she said, \u201cand that\u2019s another thing I like about your face.\u201d She kissed me on my nose.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m from Tavis,\u201d I said, \u201cTavis born and raised. My mother might have been from Valion, or maybe my father, whoever he was.\u201d My eyebrows creased. I pulled away from her kisses again. \u201cAnd what does that have to do with my face?\u201d\n\u201cLanval is the name of an ugly bird, who sings all the songs of all the birds with a beautiful voice,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a good name for one of us in a country that is not ours. You are from Valion and you are lying to me.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think I\u2019m ugly? Do you think I\u2019m an ugly bird?\u201d\nShe winked. \u201cI am either from Valion or Cape Brink, out upon the ice. It is my hair that gives me away, and your eyes that reveal your homeland to me in Valion. You would know these things if you had been raised among us.\u201d\n\u201cLies,\u201d I said, \u201cAll of them lies.\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, \u201cWhere do you think I am from? Where do you think you are from? Do you think we just wandered out of the ground like this?\u201d\n\u201cI think you are in fact an old man, who traded his body with some pretty young girls piece by piece. And I think you are from the beautiful girls of the whole world, all the prettiest ones.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI really am from Valion.\u201d\n\u201cDo you ever think of going back there? Do you think my mother\u2019s family might really be from there or Cape Brink?\u201d\nShe smiled. \u201cYou have beautiful eyes, like solar eclipses: a black iris in a dark blue sky. These are Valion eyes. They are more valuable than diamonds. Do not trade them for anything.\u201d She leaned down and kissed me on the bridge of my nose.\n\u201cYou can have them,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want your eyes,\u201d she said, \u201cI could never see them like this if they were mine. You cannot see your own eyes.\u201d\n\u201cYou could in a mirror.\u201d\n\u201cThen I would only remember you in them, and that is not the way of our people. We do not know the eyes of our fathers, if we even have them.\u201d\nI touched her body, all of it, and felt the places where it could fall apart with a sharp knife and come together again. I had known women, but I hated that she had known men. I hated that I was not the first one to discover this amazing miracle that was her curved lines, her beautiful hair and flower perfume skin.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cWe can\u2019t ride in a saddle,\u201d said one of the men, \u201cbecause our legs aren\u2019t really even, and nobody has the right saddle for us.\u201d\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t your legs even?\u201d I said.\n\u201cSome legs wear down faster than others,\u201d said another one. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhen I stole grapes at night, I had to stand out under the stars first, and let my right hand do it. That way, when I was sneaking through the vineyard, I could start at the southern tip and always know my way through to the north edge of the vineyards where I could sneak into the trees.\nI felt the north star, all the time.\nAnd the new mountains sat far north of Tavis. Galesberg was north-east, and Valion the beautiful white city of my people was beyond. And there I was, sleeping outside near a vineyard until the overseer whipped me awake for another day of work, looking up at the distant point of light tugging an invisible gossamer thread in my right hand. It lifted me up. I could feel it.\nI should never have traded hands with that old drunk.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cI used to sing songs about mermaids for an old man that had also come from the north,\u201d I said, \u201cHe talked of his life like a glorious myth. And it wasn\u2019t much, really. He got on a boat. The boat traveled to Galesberg before the continents came together. It was so glorious for him until the continents were moved. With one wave of a nostril hair, a god brought the continents together and all that glory was squat.\u201d\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve had enough,\u201d said the third man, \u201cbecause you have started to talk about religion with people you do not know well enough to talk to about religion. It is not our way. It is her way, not ours.\u201d\nI took one more long drink. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I left her,\u201d I said, \u201cDo you want my hand so I can go home to Tavis?\u201d\n\u201cWhich one?\u201d said the third man.\n\u201cMy right one,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI already have a hand,\u201d he said, \u201cand it is all I have left of my old self.\u201d\n\u201cMe, too,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had enough wine,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause you are talking about gods and love and torturing yourself over it. She didn\u2019t try to stop you. Don\u2019t forget that. You are going to your home country. You will be welcome there like a brother.\u201d\nWhy did anyone leave if it is so beautiful, so wonderful?\n\u201cToo much beauty is exhausting,\u201d said the second one. \u201cWe are not beautiful men.\u201d\n\u201cGo to sleep,\u201d said the first one. He smiled, without parting his lips. He had womanly lips that never parted much. He spoke too softly. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll feel better in the morning.\u201d\n\u201cI will trade with you,\u201d I said, \u201cand you can take my mule and my hand.\u201d\n\u201cWe have already traded with you, but you are too drunk to remember. It is your fault if you are too drunk to trade well, ugly bird.\u201d\nHad I traded already? I ran my hands along my body but it was still mine completely. The only thing that wasn\u2019t my old self was my right hand. I shook my head, and drank more wine while the three men laughed at me. They scratched at the sides of their faces like the skin itched where it connected their faces to their scalps. They did not look so monstrous. They looked like friends, to me, with such happy faces, smiling at their camp drunk. I had more wine, and more wine. When I woke up, I was in a desert and a lizard ate part of my chin and nothing I had was of my old self.\nThey left me the old sailor\u2019s hand.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWill you take these words and free me from this dry, blistering land?\nI will wander always north to Valion. My people are strong, even if the legs wear down. My hand is old and knows the way. I will go north, drinking my own sweat and blood to keep it in my body and when I finally arrive among my people no one will want my ruined skin. No one will want to trade for my worn down legs. I must have already lost my beautiful eyes. I think they took everything from me when I was drugged. They must have. I am all the cast away parts of old men\u2019s pieces, with a chewed upon chin that will always be scarred until it is discarded somewhere upon a dying man\u2019s face when he could not keep himself alive. No one will want to lay with me above a vineyard and watch the bees sip upon our perfumed and salted bodies.\nPast the mountains, until the sun falls away from the world, there is a place where I will be one of many, in a city that knows nothing of mermaids.\nWhen I arrive, I will offer everyone I meet this old hand that always knows the north star. I must lose this hand there.\nI will tell them of the travelers, and of my mother.\nIf I am very lucky, I will trade myself away entirely, until I am scattered out into the city, and I no longer have to carry all this pain that I know. Let us all carry it. Let the whole city carry pieces of this traveler\u2019s pain, that they may know what it means to live and die like this, never knowing what it means to live in a place worthy of the name of home.\nI sing into the sand.\nI pray into it.\nI stand up, now.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue23\/3lbe23_story6.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"The north star is still in my palm.

It\u2019s not like I was going to college or anything. I guess this is just about what\u2019s expected. It still doesn\u2019t stop the comments, and they don\u2019t mean anything to me because I\u2019ve made most of them myself, to other girls, and they\u2019re lukewarm supportive. But when I hear, from someone not even bothering to stay out of earshot, that they hope it doesn\u2019t end the same way as with my mother, well.\nI\u2019m nothing like her. I tell them so in terms of fuck-off, but the answer I get back isn\u2019t one I ever suspected.\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t her first kid, is all I meant.\u201d\nIf there were another, I think I\u2019d know.\n\u201cThe first one died,\u201d says Gran. \u201cIn this family, the first one always dies. I\u2019m telling you this so you don\u2019t get attached.\u201d Her hands are in my hair, smoothing it down, the long strokes of brush trying for sympathy when they can\u2019t do much more than keep the snarls away for a little. \u201cThere\u2019ll be other babies,\u201d she says.\nI don\u2019t want another baby. I don\u2019t even want this one. But babies are what girls do and I did what got it so here we are. And really, what else is there to do with life? I\u2019d have one sooner or later, there\u2019s no reason to wait another year.\n\u201cThis one won\u2019t die,\u201d I tell her. \u201cIt\u2019s growing strong and safe and I\u2019m going to keep it that way. It\u2019s what a good mother does.\u201d\nGood mothers are a sore spot. Mine ran off years back. Said she couldn\u2019t stand it anymore, living here in the country quiet with the trees all black and green around her. Said they loomed too much and ran off to the city where other things loomed bigger, wanting excitement and finding only street corners, Gran said. \u201cWe all do that too,\u201d she says now, reminding. \u201cShe\u2019ll come home eventually, when she\u2019s had enough, to be a help with your second.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one that\u2019ll live,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the one you\u2019ll care about.\u201d She leans close, the stink of her breath a warning of rot too expensive to fix. \u201cNone of us cared about the first. You\u2019re not the only one.\u201d\n\u201cI care,\u201d I tell her, stiffening, and she guffaws behind me.\n\u201cNo you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t care I\u2019d get rid of it,\u201d I say, smart-mouthed, and get the back of the hairbrush for my trouble.\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be none of that kind of talk in this house,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ll do your time like the rest of us.\u201d\nI\u2019d asked to go on the pill. She\u2019d said no, I didn\u2019t need it, even though she\u2019d been catching me with boys since I was fourteen. \u201cNothing you need to worry about yet,\u201d she\u2019d said.\nSo here I am, not worried. And no different.\nJust like everyone else.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cThey\u2019re eggs,\u201d says Gran. \u201cIt\u2019ll stop soon enough.\u201d\nI hate them. I hate always having to rinse my mouth out because after each vomit the eggs get stuck in every crevice, between teeth, pouched into the corners of cheek. I rinse and spit, rinse and spit, and lie awake still at night with my tongue busy in my mouth, probing. I\u2019m afraid to go to sleep in case one of the little eggs is still in there and it hatches.\nI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll swallow what hatches. I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t swallow it, that I\u2019ll choke in my sleep.\nI knew a girl who swallowed bleach once. I won\u2019t do the same, though watered-down it might not do much harm \u2014 not if I only used it to rinse? I just want to make sure that they\u2019re dead.\nGran takes the bleach bottle away. She gives me another bottle instead. \u201cWhiskey will do just as well,\u201d she says.\n\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t supposed to drink when you were pregnant.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t swallow, then,\u201d she says, indifferent. \u201cJust spit. No harm you can do anyway.\u201d She strokes my tear-stained, spit-stained face, my sour mouth. \u201cHarm\u2019s already done.\u201d\nI\u2019m good for so long. Two weeks, nearly.\nJust one little swallow won\u2019t hurt.\nOne is more and more, the taste gets better, gets good, I feel warm and confident, until I wake up one morning with a hangover like my head\u2019s been split, but instead of my own bed and curtains to block out the sun the sun\u2019s just hanging there, overhead, and I\u2019m flat on my back in a bald.\nNo, not a bald. A holler fill, the top of mountain cut off for mining, and the rock dumped into valley. I don\u2019t know how I got here. There\u2019s a family history of sleepwalking, I know that much, but I\u2019ve always stayed in my bed like I were nailed there.\nMy feet are bare, all scratched up and covered in dirt. It\u2019s all over me, like I\u2019ve rolled in it, like I\u2019ve buried something, and my mouth is full of earth. I spit it out, clawing at my tongue, and there in the spit-up chunks they are again: eggs.\n\u201cI need to see a doctor,\u201d I say when I get home, but Gran just shakes her head. There\u2019s no money for that, and if there was she wouldn\u2019t waste it, not on a baby that won\u2019t live. The school nurse thinks I\u2019m looking for attention. She says I brought it on myself.\nThe boy I was having sex with says it isn\u2019t his.\nNo-one will help so I just stop asking.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI\u2019m not the only one.\nShe\u2019s younger even than me. Twelve years old, is Gracie, and the small swell of belly is barely noticeable but then I\u2019m looking for it.\nHer eyes are bruised. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s sleeplessness or a response to her condition and don\u2019t ask. Her grandmother and mine leave us alone together.\n\u201cIt\u2019s rude to stare,\u201d she says.\n\u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cAt least it\u2019s my face you\u2019re staring at,\u201d she says, and her voice is a hard little shell of indifference, covering. \u201cMy dad.\u201d\nUnderstandable. Sixteen\u2019s bad but normal enough. Twelve is worse. Unless it was her dad who \u2026 but she sees that question in my face and shakes her head. \u201cI doubt he could get it up anyway,\u201d she says, calculatedly crude. \u201cThe mines have done for his lungs. He can\u2019t do anything now without coughing himself half to death.\u201d Except slap his daughter about, apparently, but then she kind of deserves it. Twelve, Jesus.\nExcept that thought, bitchy-unkind and reminiscent of nurse as it is, withers and dies when Gracie turns her little face up to me and asks if I fucked my way into blessed state or if it just happened, like it did with her.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re a virgin.\u201d\nShe isn\u2019t. She admits it. There was a boy, home from college \u2014 one of the few that ever left for there \u2014 and it was the week after her twelfth birthday. That was five months ago, and she\u2019s only three months gone.\n\u201cIt only happened the once,\u201d she says. \u201cHe had to go back to school so we didn\u2019t do it again.\u201d\nI wish I could say she looked old for her age but she don\u2019t. \u201cTold him I was sixteen,\u201d she says, and more fool him for believing it but what\u2019s done is done. Or isn\u2019t, because even I can see those numbers don\u2019t add up.\n\u201cI had someone,\u201d I tell her. \u201cIt was more than once. Lots more. It\u2019s got to be his.\u201d\n\u201cGot a special kind of dick to make you puke up insect eggs, does he?\u201d she says, and it doesn\u2019t take fingers down my throat this time, because I never knew it was insects. I puke on the floor between us, great stringy heaves of saliva and egg, and Gracie looks on, dispassionate.\n\u201cSee,\u201d she says. \u201cEggs.\u201d\nI think they\u2019re even squirming.\nGran sighs when she comes back in, seeing the vomit all over the floor. The woman with her shakes her head. \u201cI don\u2019t recall you ever being this overwrought,\u201d she says, and Gran just sighs again.\n\u201cKids today,\u201d she says, and goes for a bucket.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIt\u2019s not that dirt tastes good. It\u2019s that you\u2019ve got to dig through so much of it to get to tree roots, and then unless there\u2019s water handy those tree roots are covered with it too. We brush off the clots, Gracie and I, but they\u2019re all so smeared still. We bring water bottles in backpacks to clean the roots off before chewing down, but it\u2019s never enough to get rid of the taste of dirt completely.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather eat dirt than not eat tree roots,\u201d says Gracie, though she can\u2019t help make faces. She\u2019s not the only one. It\u2019s more suck than chew, hard as they are, and between us we\u2019ve pulled more than one splinter from our gums and lips. It doesn\u2019t stop us going back for more, but each time we go deeper in the woods because there\u2019s talk now, and worse than there was.\nNot much worse. It\u2019s not like olden days where we\u2019d be sent away or anything, and there\u2019s enough girls around my age with bellies of their own that most of the talk isn\u2019t about me. But Gracie\u2019s so young, still, and my hanging round her \u2026 maybe there\u2019s some folks think I\u2019m being kind, taking her under my wing when her dad\u2019s so clearly incapable, but there\u2019s as many see me as the bad influence. Never mind she got herself knocked up before we even met. Or got knocked up by something.\nI still don\u2019t know if I believe her.\nBut there\u2019s the eggs, and the tree roots, and none of this is normal. And there\u2019s our grandmothers, too, plotting together and they used to hang witches, I\u2019m sure I read about it in school, or squash them flat with stones or something.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not witches, are they?\u201d says Gracie, sounding young as she is for once. I wish they were, kind of. It might explain things some.\n\u201cMaybe we\u2019re the witches,\u201d she says. That might explain things as well, but I don\u2019t feel any too magical lately. And if this is power, this small thing pouching out in abdomen, I don\u2019t think I want it.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re witches,\u201d says Gracie, \u201cdoes it mean we\u2019re allowed to do bad things and not feel guilty about them?\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of bad thing you planning on doing?\u201d I ask her, and she goes all tucked in on herself and quiet, dirt under her fingernails and around her mouth and root fiber caught between her teeth. She looks like a wild animal.\n\u201dNothing,\u201d she says, and turns her face away.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWitches is as good an explanation as any.\n\u201cMaybe not,\u201d says Gracie, and she sounds older than they do. Looks it, too, with the circles round her eyes as dark as they are, and so persistent they can only come from lack of sleep. This is not to say she\u2019s escaped from bruising. They\u2019re all over her arms, and there\u2019s no amount of long sleeves can hide them when we\u2019re in the woods and digging for roots.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t hurt,\u201d she says.\n\u201cLiar.\u201d\nShe just shrugs.\nI\u2019ve heard her gran talking to mine. \u201cIt\u2019s drink and out of work,\u201d she says, his body going to pieces around him, the cough that\u2019s not let up for years. \u201cI told her not to take up with him,\u201d she says, of the daughter that\u2019s on a street corner somewhere, and given up on mothering. \u201cStill,\u201d and this time she\u2019s talking about grandchild instead of child, \u201cit\u2019s not as if he can beat it out of her.\u201d\nThere\u2019s nothing can be done to stop him so she doesn\u2019t try. No-one tries, except Gracie, and I only know that because of what falls out of her backpack when she goes for her water bottle, face smeared with dirt as it is.\nThe dolly\u2019s nothing I\u2019d give any kid, even mine, not if I didn\u2019t want their head full of nightmares. It\u2019s got coal dust smeared all round its mouth for one, and coal chips stuffed behind the tiny teeth for choking. That\u2019s how I recognize him. The arms end early, hacked off blunt at the wrists. And the stitching there\u2019s better than the shirt, which is tacked together with rags that have an old sweat smell.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want him dead, exactly,\u201d she says. Just unable. Which brings home more than anything just how young she is, because if Gracie don\u2019t realize she can be clouted just as easily by a forearm doing what a backhander could, then her imagination\u2019s worse than her truth-telling. There\u2019s pins stuck everywhere in the dolly, scorching marks, and a dampness come from drowning, or attempts of.\nGiven the new colors laid over the old on her own arms, there\u2019s nothing about the dolly that\u2019s capable.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re witches,\u201d she says, doleful. \u201cI tried lots and nothing worked. If we\u2019re witches it should work.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a pathetic thing, that dolly, but folks look down on pathetic things here. I should know. And if I can recognize who this is supposed to be, so will they. And it\u2019s not like anyone\u2019s sided with Gracie before.\nI make her bury it. I\u2019d do it myself, but I don\u2019t want to touch it at all.\n\u201cI suppose it was too much to expect,\u201d she says, and she\u2019s not wrong, because the next time I see her, the bruising under her eyes doesn\u2019t come from wakefulness.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI don\u2019t know whether to be sorry or not.\nThere\u2019s a girl in my class, in the same family way, and it lights up her face when she feels the same movement. \u201cIt\u2019s like butterflies,\u201d she says, as if this is some magic thing that\u2019s happening to her, instead of the expected event it is for the rest of us. Then again, her boyfriend\u2019s stood by her and mine pretends not to see me in hallways.\n\u201cWhat do you want me to do about it?\u201d says Gran, but I can tell she\u2019s at least a little bit proud I haven\u2019t collapsed in a watery heap for her to deal with, courtesy of someone who\u2019s not worth it. It\u2019s not as if the thing inside bothers to kick when I pass him on the way to class. You\u2019d think there\u2019d be something, some moment of recognition like in the stories, some stupid connection, but it doesn\u2019t come and he just walks on and so do I.\nThe fluttering is worst at night. It presses up from the inside \u2014 quick, light touches, and too many of them. Perhaps the thing\u2019s deformed. Perhaps that\u2019s why it won\u2019t live. You\u2019re supposed to love your kid when you see it, but when I think of the way mothers in my family treat their kids I press down on all that pulsing and tell it not to push its luck.\nThere\u2019s a moment, one night, which feels like escape. There\u2019s something coming out, an itchy scratching between legs and it doesn\u2019t hurt, exactly, but I wonder if this is it, if it\u2019s over. I\u2019d like it to be, so I don\u2019t call Gran and I don\u2019t ring for a doctor we couldn\u2019t pay for anyway. I just lie there and pray, if failed witches pray, and if anyone listens when they do.\nI don\u2019t pray for it to live, but of course the bloody thing does. There\u2019s fluttering still, that same press of movement, and when I reach between my legs and up inside myself the things I pull out are dry and fragile.\nThey\u2019re wings. Just one at first, but the scraping feeling keeps going so I keep going too, probing and stuffing in more fingers than I\u2019d like, trying to scratch out what\u2019s in there and there\u2019s a dozen in the end, a dozen little wings, which is only comforting because if it weren\u2019t an even number I\u2019d have thought I\u2019d missed one and it would be crammed up there still, waiting to send me to toxic shock.\nIn the end I empty out my pencil case and hide the wings in there. It\u2019s no use showing Gran. I already know what she\u2019d say. What do you want me to do about it? That\u2019s what she\u2019d say, indifferent to wings as she was with eggs.\nGracie is less indifferent, when we meet in the woods at our usual place with mounds of dirt around us, and me holding up little wings like our lives have lost all sense.\nGrace doesn\u2019t say What do you want me to do about it? She just reaches out and traces the edge of one, rubs it between her fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s scratchy,\u201d she says. \u201cIt feels scratchy.\u201d There\u2019s a long time where she just fingers it and doesn\u2019t say anything, and then she takes off her skirt and lays it on the ground. Takes off what\u2019s underneath, too, and spreads her legs. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she says, and puts her little hands over her eyes. \u201cDo I have them too?\u201d she says, and it\u2019s not like I want to look but there\u2019s no-one else going to do it, and we have water bottles so I can wash my hands at least.\nI\u2019ll still be scrubbing with lye when I get home. From the look on her face Gracie will be too, though it won\u2019t be her fingers she\u2019ll be scrubbing, not after all the wings I pulled out of her.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nShe doesn\u2019t go to school. She doesn\u2019t answer the door when I go to her house to knock, though I only go the once. There\u2019s not even any curtain-twitching. I don\u2019t see her in the woods. The only thing that tells me she\u2019s as fine as she can be is that her grandmother keeps coming to mine, and they keep drinking and watching their soaps and cackling, expecting me to clean up after them. Surely if her grandchild were dead, or had birthed whatever the hell is growing inside us, the old bitch would at least say something.\nI hate the pair of them. No wonder my mother left. No wonder Gracie\u2019s mother did. You\u2019ll love the second one, Gran said, but if I\u2019m the second and Gracie\u2019s the second there\u2019s no-one fucking loving us.\nIf they think I\u2019m ever having another kid after this they\u2019re crazy.\nIt\u2019s what I tell myself, anyway. Late at night, little dried wings settling under my hips, I know it\u2019s a lie. I don\u2019t have any skills. I\u2019m not going to college. There\u2019s no jobs round here anyway, and where else could I go? Women in my family always leave, but they always come back. In the end, there\u2019s nowhere else for them to live but under trees, and between mines.\nSo I\u2019ll be here, my belly gone flat like it used to be. Tits a little bigger. And someday there\u2019s going to be another boy. Maybe even the old one, if I get lonely enough and drunk enough to forget all that looking away. Whoever it is, I\u2019ll let him fuck me, because if I can\u2019t have anything else I\u2019ll have that at least.\nI know what my future is.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cHere,\u201d says Gracie, shoving a parcel at me. It\u2019s wrapped badly, but it\u2019s still wrapped which makes it a present, and therefore a step up from the rest of the day, because she\u2019s in the same boat so it might be something for me instead of a shower gift meant for baby.\nIt\u2019s a library book.\n\u201cI stole it,\u201d says Gracie. \u201cSort of. You\u2019ll have to take it back.\u201d Which makes it not much of a present at all but then I didn\u2019t get her anything either. When I tell her so she just shrugs. \u201cOther people did,\u201d she says, and I can tell from the twist of her mouth that other people got her what they got me. Handouts and baby stuff. Gran says I can always sell it, but it\u2019s second-hand most of it and not worth much. \u201cKeep it for the next one, then,\u201d she says, weaving on her feet. \u201cWhat the hell do I care?\u201d she says, belching, her breath rank with rot and rye.\nBut Gracie\u2019s still staring at me, expectant, so I let the wrapping paper drop and pretend thanks I don\u2019t feel, though I don\u2019t pretend it very well. It\u2019ll be no problem to return it. \u201cI\u2019m not much of a reader.\u201d\n\u201cMe neither,\u201d she says. \u201cBut then I started dropping bits and insect parts \u2014 not to mention the fucking eggs,\u201d and I wish she wouldn\u2019t say it because it makes my gorge rise, still. \u201cAren\u2019t you even the least bit curious?\u201d she says. \u201cWe both know there\u2019s no baby in either of us. It\u2019s got to be something else.\u201d\nThe book is a field guide to insects. An old one, and from the card in the back it\u2019s been taken out half a dozen times in fifty years. Somehow I don\u2019t think the library will miss it. Honestly, I\u2019d rather bury it where the dolly went, because after flicking through the pages it\u2019s a whole lot of leggy, creeping awfulness. Gracie snatches the book back when she sees me staring, disgusted, at the cockroaches.\n\u201cI suppose at least it\u2019s not that,\u201d she says, flicking the book so it falls open in place, like it\u2019s been bent that way before and the back is broken. Cicadas, even periodical ones, aren\u2019t much better than cockroaches, but when I turn to tell her this she\u2019s got one hand down her knickers and a searching expression on her face.\n\u201cFucking must you?\u201d I say, disgusted all over again but at least it\u2019s her fingers not mine this time. But when she lays that moist little wing flat on the page, even I can see it\u2019s a match.\n\u201cThey live underground, and swarm in cycles,\u201d she reads, grimacing. \u201cCome out every thirteen years \u2014 or every seventeen.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cThey could have told us,\u201d says Gracie, but those dates in the back of the library book say that no-one told them either. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s worse \u2014 that they didn\u2019t think we deserved better than what they got, or that it\u2019s all not over yet. But Gran\u2019s been telling me all along: it\u2019s the second kid I\u2019ll get to keep. And if that seventeen-year cycle is set to keep, there\u2019s a baby going to come along real quick after this pregnancy\u2019s over with.\n\u201cNot for me,\u201d says Gracie. \u201cNot ever me. I don\u2019t care if I have to douche with bleach every day for the rest of my life.\u201d\nThe insect book is good for something after all. When the cicadas come up from under, when they burst out into daylight, it\u2019s for weeks of mating and that sets the cycle going again, sends them back to the dark ground for another thirteen years, another seventeen.\nAll the fluttering makes sense now. I\u2019ve held cicadas in my palm before, felt the vibration, the way their wings crackle and their bodies split open and leave old skins behind. An aging thing, the end result of growth. \u201cOnce these things are out, you just keep your legs shut,\u201d I say. \u201cJust to be safe.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t work like that. Spring comes and the cicadas come, thousands of them, millions, out of soil and out of us, and Gracie and I birth them out in the woods late one night, under the dark and looming trees we\u2019d spent so long sucking on. We stumble home scratched and scoured out and empty. For a week I do nothing but sleep, and then I wake up wanting.\n\u201cThe baby died,\u201d I tell the boy who said it wasn\u2019t his. I tell him in the hallway, and he looks at me this time but only for a minute. He feels sorry for me, I know. I tell him I don\u2019t want sorry, I want to forget, and that\u2019s all it takes. He\u2019s willing enough to look again then.\nI come home after, through streets covered with dead cicadas, to see Gracie on my bed, knees tucked up to her. \u201cI should have said no,\u201d she said. \u201cI was going to say no. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t.\u201d\nShe\u2019s staying with me. She has to, until our mothers come home. There\u2019s no-one to look after us now. Gracie\u2019s father smothered in his bed, lungs full of coal dust and something else, something fluttering. And her Gran went the same as mine, coughing one night till she choked. I heard her doing it. I saw the small empty skins on the floor. Good riddance to them. If we had to swallow it down, so did they. The children we sent out into the world came home in the end, like all children do, and brought with them the ill we wanted. It seems there\u2019s a little bit of maternal loyalty left in the world, recompense for nine months of bullshit.\nPerhaps we\u2019re witches after all.\nGracie\u2019s hand is on her stomach. \u201cDo you think that they\u2019ll love them?\u201d she asks, of the mothers returning and daughters to come. \u201cDo you think we should tell them they do?\u201d She doesn\u2019t say anything of her own love, because we both know that neither of us has any left for the things that come out of us.\n\u201cWe\u2019d be telling them a lie,\u201d I say. But it\u2019s a lie they\u2019ll need, when I can\u2019t stand this place any longer, can\u2019t stand the cries and cradle days, the trees and the dark earth, and head off to the city myself. This kid will need a grandmother then, and they\u2019ll need the lies that come with.\n\u201cI can live with that,\u201d says Gracie, and she sprawls next to me on the bed, her body, bruises clearing, as flat as her voice. One small hand tucks into mine, and it strikes me that we\u2019re luckier than most, that our cycles matched up, and that won\u2019t happen again for generations. \u201cCan I come with you, when you leave?\u201d she says.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue32\/3lbe32_story1.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"I fell pregnant three months after my sixteenth birthday.

Even my own father shook his head and despaired when I spent hours staring at what seemed to him only a wall. But I saw, there in the shadows, my mother\u2019s own face, smiling and gentle. It was her hand that calmed me in the night, her cool kiss upon my brow that sent me back to sleep. Such a strange child, my father always said; wakes himself in a screaming terror only to calm himself back to sleep.\nMany children in my ward do the same, often abandoned by their parents as they struggle to see the apparitions. Many parents \u2014 many fathers, let us be blunt \u2014 cannot handle the attempts their child makes to see, to hear, that which they cannot. These fathers do not have the sight and do not understand how, especially in those so young \u2014 how could infants display such a need? It was, of course, generally impossible to explain, when they themselves did not (could not) see. It was harder with older patients \u2014 those, far too often, are filed under schizophrenic, and are never seen again.\nDom Dickinson is nineteen and has led the ideal life, beyond what he calls \u201cthe most tragic incident\u201d he has ever known. His mother was lost to him when he was eleven \u2014 she only thirty-one years old, herself. Up until then, it was picnics and bike rides and lazy outings to the lake, where they \u2014 he and his mother, mind \u2014 would drift whole afternoons away, under clear blue skies. They enjoyed strawberries together, and how she held the back of his bike as he learned to ride without training wheels.\nThe afternoon she was lost to him was a November; he hates Novembers to this day, cannot explain in a way his father will understand. His father never shared the loss \u2014 his wife had gone long, long ago, he was fond of saying \u2014 eleven years prior, if he\u2019s feeling specific. But Dom remembers a longer life with his mother, a life of adventures and dreams, until November took that away. After, life became a series of gray days; of adventures tucked into trunks and boxes and stored in the attic. Of outings with his father, surely, but Dom found little joy in fishing, shooting, or riding; he always looked for his mother, even when his father told him to stop, that no such person existed.\nAdam Dickinson is forty-one, an accomplished investment banker. He tends to large accounts \u2014 celebrity accounts, he calls them, though cannot be specific in who he manages. He is fond of saying some things should be kept secret and out of sight. He feels this way about Dom\u2019s mother \u2014 will not even speak her name when pressed. No, he says; Dom was a blessing upon my life, and I cannot explain it otherwise. There was no one he knew as \u201cwife,\u201d nor will he admit to \u201cmother.\u201d What of his own mother, though? When asked, Adam looks momentarily confused \u2014 there is biology to account for, after all. How does one procreate if there is no \u2014\nNo. Adam will stop me there. His brow will crease and he will look away. When he finally looks up at me, his eyes are filled with a deeper confusion. We cannot know our place in the heavens, he eventually says. Where is the sun? How can we know? This world is constantly falling through the heavens \u2014 we have no fixed place, and I see no one.\nBut once, I think, you did.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe afternoon sun catches in the fine strands of her hair and I can see how the dark cloud of it is beginning to go silver. It\u2019s like she\u2019s a storm cloud with a fine silver lining beginning to emerge. I wonder how long it has been so \u2014 if I have noticed before and just didn\u2019t see.\nI stare so long she nudges me, and I blink. \u201cOctavia,\u201d I say, wanting to imprint her name into my mouth. Wanting to not forget this moment, this sliver of silver in the otherwise dark. I am afraid to become as they are, to forget what I absolutely know.\nShe nudges me again. \u201cDon\u2019t sass your mother \u2014 you call me momma, remember.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nNancy visits him every day \u2014 stands outside his door, because it is barred to all but doctors. Her visits are something John no longer admits aloud \u2014 but I have seen him have entire conversations with her \u2014 have seen the way she smooths down the cowlick in his silver hair though she cannot touch him through the glass window. We never had children, he says to her, and she shakes her head. We never could, she replies, and his hands tremble until her own calm them. He draws in a breath and pulls away, only to touch her glass-reflected cheeks, shoulders, and the outline of her shadow on the floor. The orderlies find the outline in the morning \u2014 it looks like a body outlined in dust and they wonder if Mr. Clarke has marked the space of his own death.\nWhen I find him three days later, motionless upon the floor within that hasty frame, he\u2019s clutching a monogrammed handkerchief edged in lace. I fold it into my pocket, away so the world will not see, will not question.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nImpossible, some whisper.\nNo, that was what she said \u2014 a gift from my father on the birth of their first child.\nFirst \u2014 so there were others? There is proof of \u2014 a constant and continued contact? A \u2014 relationship?\nThere was another \u2014 a sister, but she \u2014\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMolly is not quite as thin as Sparrow, her body not ravaged by drugs or abuse. I would say she is getting rounder, is with child, but I don\u2019t know. This is no hospital for such tests \u2014 nor are many these days, I suppose. How can one treat what one cannot see? Sparrow lifts his hands to the window of his observation cell, while Molly presses hers against the glass. Sparrow shudders and shrieks \u2014 spittle flies from his mouth and he shakes in his skin, shakes until Molly hushes him and says everything\u2019s gonna be all right. But he doesn\u2019t believe her.\nCan\u2019t be, can\u2019t be, can\u2019t be, he says, until the two words flow like a litany from him. Never gonna, never gonna, never gonna, he adds, and then Sparrow is on his feet, moving in circles to keep Molly out of his line of vision. He smears the window glass with tongue and fingers until she blurs, but she\u2019s still there, swimming at the edges, screaming his name, telling him to come down. It\u2019s just the ecstasy, Sparrow tells himself \u2014 it\u2019s just the drug making him dizzy and sick \u2014 and though I\u2019ve tried to tell him, he won\u2019t believe he\u2019s been clean for three weeks. There\u2019s nothing foreign or addictive in his system, nothing at all; when I tell Molly, she nods and she doesn\u2019t come back \u2014 and I wonder if that\u2019s my mistake. Telling her she\u2019s not in Sparrow\u2019s blood \u2014 even as she is. But it\u2019s Sparrow who won\u2019t see \u2014 or who will see, and cannot handle the reality of her moving through his world. He doesn\u2019t need her; he\u2019s fine on his own, fine.\nUntil he\u2019s not.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI was born there \u2014 though repeating this now earns me scowls and hurried changes in conversation. My sister though, begins to earn me the same thing; stories about her make people uncomfortable, because there is paperwork, names and seals and there is a recoded history of her that no one can \u2014 or wants \u2014 to explain. There is an image captured on film; there is a blue imprint of her impossibly small hand, every fingerprint a work of art.\nMemories are mine alone \u2014 the way she was light, like feathers wrapped in that soft blanket \u2014 but these records are there for anyone to see. She did exist \u2014 and even my father did know her, love her, hold her. I tell myself this often \u2014 that he knew her, that he named her Sara for his own mother \u2014 I turn these things over between my long fingers the way I do the golden bean that was once my mother\u2019s.\nOctavia.\nMomma.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSimon appears normal and pleased to see me, because I alone enter his room and sit on the bed opposite his own. I do not stare at him in horror and don\u2019t recoil when his small, cool hands touch my own. He wants to know what the papers say about him, and I tell him the papers say nothing. No one will tell me, I say, and Simon laughs. All right then, he says.\nIt\u2019s some weeks before I see on my own \u2014 how Simon can close his eyes and show a person every woman they have known. It is a flood of memory, something no other should have access to, but in Simon\u2019s cheerful presence, I am reminded of my first love, Esme; of my last love, Jeanne; of my aunts, Willa and Thea and Mae. And of my mother \u2014 my mother who Simon is surprised to discover I share lunch with every day.\nHis lips part \u2014 he cannot believe that I believe \u2014 and he sinks upon the bed as if exhausted. He stares at me the way doctors have stared at him and then he exhales.\nSo I\u2019m not \u2014\nNot what, I prompt.\nCrazy. They exist. They \u2014\nLive.\nAnd Simon cries like he\u2019s never cried before \u2014 still four years old in his heart and bones \u2014 and maybe, I think, he has not.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHe looks up at me today and his mouth splits in a sudden smile. He can\u2019t believe I\u2019m here \u2014 I\u2019m still working at the hospital? Still and still, I say, and his arm circles my shoulders warmly. His arm feels so thin \u2014 and light, the way Sarah felt light when I held her. He is growing hollow, and thin, and in the corner of his eye, I see the tumbling river.\nI draw the necklace from my pocket, unsure what I mean to do with it. It coils in my palm, glinting in the afternoon sun the way it did long ago around my mother\u2019s neck. A gift from your father, she told me, a magical bean I want you carry now, so you will always know \u2014 that once, he remembered; that once, he saw.\nNow, I hold my hand out and my father looks down. There are tears in his eyes and I cannot tell if he sees the necklace or not; he looks to the river path, where my mother approaches. I want to wave to her, I want to tell her to join us, but I am frozen. Does he see her? Does he \u2014 He sits rail-straight, color having drained from his cheeks. Then, he looks away.\nMy mother sits to my other side, and I close her necklace into my hand. Why do these women vanish from the world \u2014 I cannot yet explain it. It is not something within them, I think, but something within the rest of the world \u2014 within the way the light slants and changes a person\u2019s perspective. If I could alter the world\u2019s perceptions, I would be a rich man, indeed, but it is not for wealth, and not for \u2014\nThe necklace slips from my hand to spool into the grass and without thinking, my father bends to pick it up. He is old, but still flexible, still capable of growth and change and when he straightens, he does not return the necklace to me, but reaches beyond me \u2014 beyond me, to place the necklace, without err, into my mother\u2019s palm.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue28\/3lbe28_story1.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"The earlier it happens, the better.

Judith had come running at dusk, hearing the zebra scream. Rifle in hand, she\u2019d stood there, frozen. The roars ripping the night, miserable about sharing, crying out for her. She counted eyes in the dark and shot them, one by one, as they disregarded bullets and devoured the corpse of the zebra. Eyes at night are anonymous; it could have been coyotes or wild dogs. It was not.\nHer children rotted in the pale autumn, leaving a gaping rib cage exposed with a stiff carrion curtain. Judith often wondered what it would be like to crawl inside and go to sleep. The head of the zebra rested between two lions, their maws forever nuzzling the creature. It was all Biblical, she thought. If only she knew which Psalm to apply.\nA cicada flew down, almost invisible in the dusty yellow grass by her foot. With a quick stomp, she crushed it. Delicately dug the insect free of her instep. Placed it in her upturned hat to preserve all pieces.\nWithout any head protection now, she had to check the fence quickly. A lope around the perimeter; already her cheeks and nose began to burn. Her fair skin a gift from an Irish grandmother who never expected to set eyes on such a place as this \u2014 flat, sandy, gray. She noted no holes, no bent places, nothing torn.\nThat night, as she placed the cicada into the embers at fire\u2019s outer edge, she had to admit that they were no longer testing her. Now they were waiting.\nThe cicada did not taste very terrible, not that she knew the difference anymore.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAll the cages were empty now. Unless you counted old Hallibal\u2019s cage; the tufted fur yet clung, the paws still curled. His claws were clean. She had looked.\nIt was proof of Gwen\u2019s report, dated last April 17th. Hallibal had remained lion until the end of his days. If only the zebra hadn\u2019t escaped. Judith had been saving it for his last meal. It might\u2019ve lasted weeks. She could deal with the stench of rot. There were flowers that smelled less sweet.\nIt was the same zebra, she was sure. Their stripes were like fingerprints. Zebra 3, forever without a herd. She closed her eyes that morning, as she always did, when she reached the cave, a gross benediction for an animal she had never loved like the lions. It was unfair of her, she knew. But love always was a ladder.\nWhen she opened them, something moved behind the ribs. She flinched. Of course it was only insects, or further corruption of the carcasses, or a vulture.\nSmall fingers reached beyond the cage.\nJudith\u2019s breathing stopped.\nCicadas, she thought. Blood pounding in her ears, she listened for the whir of wings \u2014\nA pair of green eyes.\nShe could not approach the fence, could not move, her boots were rooted in cement. Her lungs were filled with it. The thing inside the zebra pressed its mouth to a broken shoulder blade.\nThe roar shook her. She stumbled backward, gained her feet and ran.\nThere was nothing to eat that day, and the water from the roof tasted like rust. She crouched by Hallibal\u2019s enclosure, her mouth dry, and waited, like always, for the lift and slump of his chest. It never happened.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIt was from a time before, but now she saw how the light crept up the walls, how the mouth of the lion was open even then, though she did not hear it.\nJudith made acorn coffee. The filter sank into her cup, and she sighed. For a moment, she forgot about the strange thing that had occurred the previous day at the cave. She merely wondered what she could eat, if it was worth attempting to plant some of the remaining seeds inside the house, in the little glass box she had made. The other seeds had failed to sprout, or died quickly. It was possible that she would soon wither as well. She wondered what it would be like. It would be worth it if Gwen would be there, on the other side, but neither had subscribed to those sorts of beliefs before. It seemed deceitful to start now.\nShe had never admitted this one thing to Gwen: that she believed in reincarnation. Gwen would have laughed. That would have been an interesting discussion, yes, but in the end, her belief would have been dismissed. So she had privately held to it. A duplicity that hadn\u2019t seemed to matter. Her mother had often said that Judith was a girl who lied. Not to be trusted.\nA cry from outside. Judith had not stretched, nor done her jumping jacks. Her muscles were stiff as she ran to the fence. To the exact spot. Knowing where the cry came from, afraid to know.\nThe girl curled inside the zebra. Even from thirty feet, Judith could see her freckles, her blonde hair tangled, the color of Kansas dirt in a drought. Her chest was bare and bony.\nWe could starve together, Judith thought.\nShe swayed, and the child crept on hands and knees from her hiding spot.\nJudith opened her mouth to speak, call the girl closer, but then she saw.\nThe girl wore a scrap of fur on her back. It tied in an ugly knot around her neck.\nHer chin lifted, the girl sniffed. Scented Judith. Opened her mouth in a pant.\nThe rifle jerked in her arms. Shaking, she pointed. Sighted. The girl stretched her neck, grinned.\nJudith turned, trotting back to the house first, then running, frustrated screams at her back.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t Africa. We can\u2019t just let them go.\u201d\nJudith thought of all the pythons released in the Florida Everglades. They had a better chance, maybe, than the lions.\n\u201cBesides, you know I need them. For my research.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t we know everything we need to know about lions?\u201d\nGwen stared at her, a cup in her hands, light blue powder leveled off.\nShe dumped in the last cup and heaved a bucket handle in each hand. She backed out through the door to the pens.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay, you know.\u201d\nJudith peeled off the gloves and washed her hands, listened to the lions roaring for their food, the crash of their bodies against the fences. Some of the vitamin powder had spilled onto the stainless steel counter. She touched her thumb to it, lifted it to her mouth.\nAfter a late dinner, when Gwen was at the computer, Judith came up behind her and put her hands on her shoulders. Gwen tensed. Gently, gently, Judith bit down on the tender part between neck and shoulder.\nSeventy-one, Judith thought, remembering that night. She had been seventy-one.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cOne-fifty,\u201d said Gwen.\n\u201cSeven hundred.\u201d The man with the tired capuchin on his shoulder pulled a cigarette from a pocket in his overalls. \u201cHad his teeth removed myself.\u201d\nJudith was repulsed. Gwen said, \u201cOne-twenty-five, then.\u201d As the man\u2019s eyes widened, she told him that she wasn\u2019t paying for a lion with missing parts.\nThe man wheezed. \u201cGonna take off for his missing ball, then?\u201d He wheezed harder, spat yellow, and lit his cigarette. \u201cAccident with the bear,\u201d he said, around puffs.\nA girl and her parents came by. \u201cYou can touch his paw, honey,\u201d said the man. The girl reached out and stroked the beast\u2019s paw. A tremor passed through the lion, as if shaking off a fly. The girl screamed, but the lion barely cracked an eye before drifting off again.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cPicture!\u201d insisted the father, and his daughter laid her hand atop the lion\u2019s paw, smiling. Everyone laughed but Judith. After they left, Gwen said, \u201cA hundred. Take it or leave it. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s really healthy. And I don\u2019t exactly need another one.\u201d\nThe man shrugged. \u201cHe earns a hundred a week, I reckon. Might as well keep him.\u201d\n\u201cTwo hundred,\u201d said Judith. Both parties stared. \u201cTwo-fifty.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Judith.\u201d\nBut the man was smiling. \u201cI\u2019d probably consider it for three.\u201d\n\u201cDone.\u201d Judith twitched. \u201cI got to write a check, though.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t take no checks,\u201d said the man.\nGas stations passed on US-160 flashed through Judith\u2019s mind; surely one of them had an ATM.\nGwen sighed. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re fine with cash. I\u2019ll be right back. It\u2019s in the car.\u201d\n\u201cFine with cash,\u201d the man mused to the sky, or the capuchin. \u201cYessir, just fine.\u201d\nHallibal walked out of his cage with an enormous chain leash around his neck, the man holding one end. He walked up into the back of the trailer, slumped to the floor, and yawned.\nAll the way back \u2014 three hours \u2014 Gwen groused about the rules, about who made the business decisions. Judith kept an eye on her side mirror, staring at the barred window, waiting for a shaggy skull to emerge.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe water buckets had been bone dry for weeks. The girl sometimes appeared at the door, hands on the screen. After three days, Judith got up and lifted the latch.\nOn the fourth day, she stumbled onto the porch. Hallibal snoozed, a paw over the side. She stepped closer. Thought about lying next to him, about burying her face in his mane, dusty and lion-smelling.\nDeep, rhythmic grunting. From out at the cave. She blinked. Hallibal was gone. Just like his teeth.\nThe cicadas had come like an invading army, covering the ground. She stooped and ate one, its brown wings hitting her face. Licked tiny legs from her palm. The rest of the insects eyed her warily as she stepped among them, but she ignored them. They rose, at last, a clicking tornado around her.\nOut at the cave, the girl was not alone. The skeletons of dead lions surrounded her. She wore their bones, mingled them with the zebra\u2019s.\nJudith stood, swaying, two feet from the fence. \u201cThere\u2019s no rain,\u201d she told the girl.\nThe girl shrugged. Her eyes were green like the savanna in May.\nJust behind the trees, gaunt bodies roamed. They should have moved on, she thought. Should have claimed a city for their own. Last radio reports described lions in the streets, a confusion before shots brought them down. Before they realized that the lions were only a vanguard. Before crows fell out of the sky.\nJudith and Gwen had only ever taken one safari. Private, with guides who spoke perfect English. Lions had lounged yards from them. No fences to keep them safe.\nTo keep who safe? She giggled, stepped forward, leaned her forehead against the fence. No electricity since last April.\nThe girl unfolded spindly legs, stood in a wash of dust and bones.\n\u201cAre you tired of cicadas?\u201d she asked.\nJudith didn\u2019t answer. The girl stuck out her tongue. It was blue.\nFrom the compound far behind her, Hallibal roared. She knew that roar anywhere: hoarse, rasping. She turned, her heart leaping. He was alive. He could be alive.\nThe girl launched herself at the fence. It clattered but held against her small body. Judith toppled backward. Small fingers wriggled at her through the diamond openings.\nThe girl\u2019s mouth opened, pantomiming a roar. Tiny white teeth scraped against the metal.\nBehind her, behind the cave, the yellow-leafed cottonwoods swayed.\nThe rest of the pride emerged.\nAcross the dead clay and scrub grass, they walked. Slow. Bodies gaunt. Heads low.\nThey couldn\u2019t break the fence. Could they? It was too tall to climb. Topped with two rows of barbed wire.\nThe girl shut her mouth. The remaining lions \u2014 Gwen\u2019s lions \u2014 stood behind her in a ragged line.\nThey weren\u2019t lions anymore.\nCloser to the fence, reaching out for her.\nThe zebra\u2019s teeth bit into the sandy ground, a lonely bray that brought tears to her eyes. She had done this, she had. Not Gwen.\nThe day the lions had lain in their pens, breath heaving, tongues hanging heavy and blue from frothing mouths. The day she watched birds come down to peck at them. While Gwen crouched nearby with a clipboard and camera. Speaking into a voice recorder.\nHelp them. Help them!\nShe\u2019d run inside to call a vet, but Gwen ran in behind her, throwing the cell phone. Telling her to go home if she couldn\u2019t handle it. This was her life\u2019s work. She was on the verge \u2014 Judith couldn\u2019t ruin it now \u2014 didn\u2019t she understand anything she\u2019d told her?\nJudith found antibiotics in the food prep shed. No idea if they could help. Loading a needle, Gwen glanced up as Judith opened the first pen.\nKyle, the smallest male. Not Hallibal, who hadn\u2019t been there long, who paced in the pen opposite, pacing and growling for the first time since arriving, throwing himself at the metal. Kyle, who had always been small.\nBig enough to take down Gwen, teeth on her shoulder, claws digging into her thighs and stomach, as Judith attempted to drag her free.\nShe had no gun. The needle fell, disregarded. He began to feed while Judith stood outside the open door. While Gwen\u2019s left arm feebly beat the ground.\nThe rest of the lions stirred, opening yellow eyes. They had been near death, and now they roused.\nJudith could not comprehend. Could not see anything but Gwen. Her knees cracked as she slumped to the ground. In panic or revenge, desperate to make things right, she stumbled from pen to pen, opening them. Hoped they would devour her too. The lions sniffed her in passing, fled in straw-colored streaks.\nShe hadn\u2019t opened the outer gate. Coming to her senses hours later, she sprinted.\nWhen the reports on television showed dead crows littering the highway, dogs staggering in pastures, cows bellowing as they were ravaged by something other than lions, she repaired the gate as best she could. Loops of chain, hammering the bars as straight as she could. The lock was unsalvageable. Everything was unsalvageable.\nNo one called to ask how the lions had got out. No police showed up. Already, Hutchinson was under siege. Nobody knew from what.\nThe pride didn\u2019t get far. Shot, some of them. Some died in the streets.\nSome returned.\nMeanwhile, the rest of the world spun in a confusion of dead birds falling from the sky, of sickness, of small children mauled to death by the family cat.\nShe turned it off at mentions of babies in cribs.\nThe electricity went off a week later. She continued to feed Hallibal. No vitamins left. She opened cans of green beans and beets for him. Watched for him to become lethargic, for his tongue to turn blue.\nFour zebra died. He ate them, though Judith didn\u2019t join him. The vegetarian at the end of the world.\nIt took her two days to bury Gwen. The stain in the pen remained, stubbornly. She never walked over there. There was no benediction.\nThe pride attacked the fence.\nHallibal starved.\nSo did she.\nThe new pride joined the girl at the fence. Pressed their bodies close. Their mouths opened and closed.\nThe roaring filled her head.\nThe cave was crushed as more came, ambling out of the cottonwood. Climbing over one another. The fence bent.\nMore.\nMore.\nThe fence slinging wires, snapping like metal bones. A section fell. They tread without pause across curls of barbed wire.\nShe was halfway to the pen, running past Kyle\u2019s, throwing herself against Hallibal. Beetles scurried out of his mouth.\nThe girl came first, padding on bare feet.\nThe others paused outside the pen, a restless, circling mass.\nGingerly, the girl picked up the lion\u2019s paw. Laid it atop Judith\u2019s arm. She was filthy and naked but for the scrap of fur. And hungry.\nWe could starve together.\nSlowly, Judith opened her arms. The girl scrambled in, clutching at her, turning her head to snarl at those outside the pen. Hallibal\u2019s head was heavy against her back, his fur coarse.\nShe stood, holding the girl, a growling, huffing form hardly heavier than a pail of meat. She spared one last look for the lion, hide sunken over ancient bones, before turning to face her children.\nThey were all hungry.\nAnd she would feed them.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue22\/3lbe22_story6.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"Judith of the lions looked beyond the fence, beyond the cave of skulls.

Trust you not to be as cruel as the world around me. Even when the news sites blamed you and your kind and said you were the cause of the explosion at school when I knew it was the white kid in Twelfth Grade, that guy with the ratty baseball cap, even then I trusted you. Even when they blamed you for the Climate Hungers and the New New War and all those corrupt politicians in all those countries. And when Rainey, my best friend since First Grade, said I\u2019d been hypnotized, brainwashed, ruined, and then she sat four rows away from me the whole next year and switched to a different session of Band Camp, still I kept trusting you.\nRainey hadn\u2019t seen what I\u2019d seen, inside my head as shiny bright fluids flowed from you to me\u2014a world without closed borders, runaway climate horrors, withheld medicine. A might-be, could-be future. And, each night as I cried myself through a whole box of tissue, I promised myself, hell, I promised you, wherever you\u2019d gone, that I\u2019d keep that long view, that amazingly hopeful view alive.\nHow could Rainey know any better? She doesn\u2019t have a golden bloom arcing across one temple and down over an ear like me, like the teenagers I found online, the ones gifted by the Lucans too. We named ourselves the Lucky Few and set up secure chat rooms and talked and talked and talked. About how your visit here, all seven hundred of you, had amped up thousands of teens\u2019 brains. We pooled our knowledge and I learned about ventromedial prefrontal cortices and how you\u2019d basically OD\u2019d us on very specific neurotransmitter uptake chemicals. We all became brain experts. Juarez even convinced his geneticist mom to do some scientific trials.\nNow, as the New New War rages everywhere and most of Oregon is evacuated and I can smell wildfire smoke here in Seattle even in my sleep, we talk about how the world is headed down a path that no one wants, no one intends, but no one can seem to stop.\nExcept us lucky few.\nOne of my new friends in Japan explains it really well. Kintsukuroi. When a vase is broken, the cracks get repaired with flashy bits of gold. Don\u2019t hide the damage, turn it into artwork, make it better than before. I think that\u2019s what you were trying to do, make us better, give us the gut-wrenching gift of knowing just how awful future Earth will be if we don\u2019t hit the brakes, get rational about climate change, get reasonable about human rights, wake up to our responsibilities.\nYou tried to give us hope, with your inserted visions of a better future, a greener one, a post-capitalism circular economy, a sustainable population. A world where no one is sick or hungry or homeless.\nI know you meant well. I know there must be reasons you didn\u2019t inject your golden gooey gel into mature forty-year-olds who have more developed coping skills than us teenagers, or to babies who could adapt quicker. Hormones, and physiology, and a dozen reasons why you expected teenagers\u2019 brains to work better for your treatment. I totally do trust you thought we were the right demographic.\nBut your motivations don\u2019t matter.\nYou\u2019re breaking us.\nDay by day, we\u2019re losing Lucky Few who can\u2019t limit their forward-sight to only the good outcomes, the happy futures where kindness and balloons and rainbows shower down on all the world for ever and ever. Instead, no matter how they fight it, their minds receive continual streams of awfulness. Last month, in Chennai, Priyaa drank rat poison when she couldn\u2019t stop looping through the internal sight of EMPs wiping out all services in Tamil Nadu and the hospitals trying to function without electricity or computers. On Tuesday, Eric drove his motorcycle into a brick wall rather than face endless images of starving children orphaned on NYC streets.\nMaybe you just didn\u2019t know that human teenagers\u2019 brains work differently than adults, and the visions all hit me super hard in my still-growing heart, my center, my core being. Seeing another pandemic, another wrongly elected official, another habitat destroyed, is as soul-wrenching as if it happened directly to me myself. I didn\u2019t sleep for 36 hours after brain-streaming a sped-up clip of climate refugees being turned away at a border.\nI guess you didn\u2019t know humans\u2019 potential for cruelty.\nAnyway, what I wanted to tell you, three years later, is we\u2019re going to make that optimistic wonderful world happen. I\u2019m accepted into college for Political Science with an Environmental Studies minor. I\u2019ve blown off my school friends who only want to play video games and party. All the other Lucky Few are heading along similar paths.\nSo your plan worked. We will make the world good AF, you\u2019ll see.\nBut then, then we\u2019ll do more than that. We\u2019ll figure out interstellar space travel. And we\u2019vll follow your path right back to the cold stars you came from.\nNot because we want to explore. Not because we want to thank you in person. A worse reason, an awful reason, one that resonates more with the kind of people we humans currently are. Us Lucky Few are going to make you suffer for what you did.\nOn some days, days when the air is clear enough to breathe and the latest vaccine is helping curb the latest virus, I think you just wanted to help our struggling species reach our potential.\nOn other days, I think that you maybe did know that revenge is a much stronger emotion than hope.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue34\/3lbe34_story6.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"You couldn\u2019t help it.

The ropes strained, and so too did his muscles. This room could have been anywhere, anywhen; I could not count how many had come to this place to be so tortured.\n\u201cP-please.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nI spread my wings, sheltering us for a moment from the sunlight which stole in through the half-shuttered windows. The shadow blotted out the faint bars of light and the man in the chair shuddered. Softly, I began to sing.\nThe chamber which held us was a special thing, a place created just for this act. My contralto rose from my throat to slip through copper channels in the ceiling, flowing up and out. It returned to us as I began the second verse, twined with the voices of my sisters. The man exhaled, his head dropped forward.\nThis was why they came, to experience the song. They might ask to be released \u2014 some even went so far as to scream \u2014 but being denied was all part of the inherent pleasure.\nThe bound man had never graced this house before. The song deepened and his body shook and just when it seemed he might truly fall apart, he became utterly still. I watched him in the shadow of my wings and sang a final note, letting it taper off. A final breath of sound echoed down the copper channels.\nIt was that moment I lived for, the moment when the tremble became stillness. In that stillness there lingered a hundred poems and had I the words for them, I would have committed them to parchment. I couldn\u2019t latch onto them though, let alone know them well enough to preserve, for they were as fleeting as the songs we sang. You might experience it, but it was a thing you could never truly possess. Once it had passed, it had passed.\nWhere did he go in those moments after? What thoughts claimed his mind? I peered at his face and found it peaceful, where only moments before there had been a tension, a desperate desire to flee and not-flee. The lines of his brow smoothed, his breathing eased, and he rested heavily in the ropes.\nI left him for the time being. I leapt from the back of the chair, talons clicking on the rough floor as I picked my way toward the nearest window. I peeked out, to stare down into the harbor where all manner of ships converged, old and new alike. The house was busy today. The water lapped against their hulls like a tongue.\nGifted with wings, my sisters and I were not bound to the water, though many of us could not escape its call. Some among us called that ironic, for how many men could not escape our call? That we should be drawn by such a thing amused some, terrified others.\nThough I was not bound, I found it hard to leave. I had flown inland enough times to know the water had its own pull on me; even in the rocky foothills, I could feel the slosh and beckon. When I slept on the ground or in a tree, it was the coastline I dreamed of, soft sand under foot and wing.\n\u201cMy \u2014 Book.\u201d\nI turned to find the man had roused, though his head was still bent. I crossed back to his side and loosened the ropes before retrieving the pack he had brought with him. He drew out a leather-bound book, inkwell, and quill. I snapped my wings at the sight of the feather.\n\u201cNot from your kind,\u201d he said, and dipped the quill into the ink, placing it then to the page.\nHe wrote. He wrote with such speed I could not decipher any of what flowed from the nib \u2014 not that I would have done much better had he slowed, for I was still learning the ways of words.\n\u201cI w-wonder,\u201d he whispered, \u201cif you hear it the way we do.\u201d\nThe song. I crouched across from the chair, watching the way the light fought its way through the shutters to gleam upon his tangle of gold hair. There was a song in that, too, the light and the gold and the battle to reach a thing you couldn\u2019t fully. I opened my mouth and sang a note that spoke of this; the quill ceased its motion upon the page and the man looked at me with such a hunger.\n\u201cAgain.\u201d\nNormally, we did not sing to men if they were not bound. This had put sisters in peril over the years, for one never knew how men would react to the song. Besides, if we freed them, we would rarely feast. Still, I sang the note again, curious. Curiosity was the devil\u2019s domain, but I supposed I had been courting it from the moment I came to this house. I sang again.\nFor a moment, all was well and we sat as we were, his quill poised over his page. And then, he shoved the book to the floor and leapt for me. I didn\u2019t know what he intended and didn\u2019t let him get close enough to find out. Instinct took over and I struck out with one wing, tumbling him to the floor. His shoulder made a firm thud against the planks and then he was up and charging me. I turned and lifted a foot this time and though I was careful, his tunic showed bright blood when he hit the floor for a second time.\nI pinned him and spread my wings over us.\nHe tried to speak, but could not catch his breath. I sat in silence, watching my reflection swim in his wide pupils. Was it like a drug, this song? I sang again, enough to allow my voice to reach that of my sisters. He flinched beneath me as the song poured down the copper channels like water; when I fell to silence, he calmed.\nI should have feasted then, but his book had fallen upon the floor, spreading a new page open. What I glimpsed made me pause. I slid off him and moved for the book. The leather was cool in my hands, the page smooth. My fingers skimmed over an inked sketch, a curved female form. This woman stood naked, her hair streaming back over her shoulders and across \u2014\nMagnificent wings spread behind her, arching out of her back. Every feather was detailed, the shaft, the vane, the delicately rounded tips. A blush of color stole across them, too, and though I pressed my nose to the page, I could not tell which berry he had used.\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d I asked. I turned the book to face him, showing him the sketch.\n\u201cA dream,\u201d said he, and slowly pushed himself to sitting. His fingers prodded at his chest in a careful exploration of the wounds my talons had done him. \u201cSo few return, everyone wonders.\u201d\nI cocked my head, as if listening to a new sound. It was not difficult to discern what he meant. \u201cSo few see us.\u201d Men would always be curious, it was a thing the gods had long cursed them with, but this \u2014 Did he mean to take this back and show people? Had he presumed he would live so long?\n\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d He slid backward on the floor, plainly seeing something in my face that upset him. \u201cI wanted to ask you\u2026\u201d He swallowed, his throat working hard. \u201cThere is a piece of marble in the ruins. I think you are inside it.\u201d\nI closed the book. The ruins were off limits to humans and I wondered that he had been there and had explored enough to discover the slab of marble. I thought I knew the one of which he spoke; it was flawless, like cream made solid, the color of my wings.\n\u201cIs this me, within your book?\u201d I placed it flat on the floor and pushed it toward him. It whispered against the floor until it hit his leg. His hand curled protectively around it.\n\u201cThe dream of you, perhaps.\u201d\nI shifted on the floor, still crouched, from foot to foot. I tucked my wings behind me, chilled though it was a midsummer\u2019s day. If he was curious, I was even more so. What did this human mean?\n\u201cTomorrow at dawn,\u201d I said. \u201cI will take you.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhen we have had a long evening of singing and feasting, it is rare to see anyone up with the first sun. Thus, the house stood silent as I draped myself in linen and picked my way down the stairs. Yesterday, one of the men had brought us sweet fruits and these still cluttered around the hearth. Had this man been released thanks to his offering? We were not in the habit of letting men go; most who came to the house knew and understood this. Some welcomed it.\nI picked up a small watermelon and broke it open, to feast on the golden flesh inside. I spit the seeds as I left the house, walking around the porch to look down at the harbor. I counted three older boats that would soon need selling, and made a note to speak to my elder sister. We did not ruin every man who journeyed to this island, for how would we survive? The island did provide water and grain, and a handful of fruit trees with the occasional net full of fish, but there were things we desired that we might not otherwise have. We could fly anywhere, true, but we do not go among humanity if we can help it. The marketplaces and cities are far too dangerous for our kind. It is best we remain a myth to the masses.\nThe young man of yesterday already awaited me, lingering near the dock. I paused to stare at him while I devoured the melon. I was spitting more seeds when he looked up to see me. His face brightened with the joy I usually only see inside the house when we are singing. He ran to me. He carried no weapons, only the book he had brought yesterday. He made a sweeping bow before me and when he looked up, I offered him half the melon.\n\u201cLadybird. My thanks.\u201d\n\u201cCome,\u201d I said, and turned without looking to see if he would follow. I knew he would, lest my sisters find him and think him a convenient way to break their fast.\nHe was surprisingly quiet as we crossed the meadow, until he saw the first bones. I took him the cluttered way intentionally, wanting him to see exactly what he dared. His sharp intake of breath proved to me one thing: when he visited the temple ruin, he had gone the longer way, probably taking the coastline. He had likely watched us longer than I previously thought, avoiding the meadow where we liked to lounge and feast.\n\u201cMost don\u2019t return,\u201d I said, and his steps caught up with mine. I glanced at him, not surprised by the horror upon his young face.\n\u201cThe stories say as much, but I\u2026\u201d He trailed off as we skirted a fresher corpse. My youngest sister had not yet learned how to savor every bite. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary to see why most don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWe needs must eat.\u201d I felt it needed explaining, but he shook his head and held up a hand.\n\u201cOf course you do. We humans prey on those smaller than ourselves, so why wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\nIf he realized his peril, it didn\u2019t seem to bother him. I held my silence and bent my head back to the melon, taking another sweet bite. The scent of the melon warded off that of the meadow and kept me from thinking of sweeter flesh as we neared the ruin.\nWhere the meadow rises in terraces, the crocus fade away, running to shorter grasses before they give way to time-worn stones. The ruins rise over these three levels, mostly broken now. Moss grows on the north side of the marble, bird nests dot the taller columns, and sometimes you can find turtles sunning themselves on the flat rocks.\nThe young man had finished his own melon by the time we reached the ruin and he tossed the rind to the meadow. I ate the rind of mine, savoring the tartness which burst against my tongue in sharp contrast to the sweet of the yellow flesh.\n\u201cOutstanding,\u201d he said, and began to climb the stones, picking his way toward the slab of marble in which he said I resided. The stone was taller than him and five times as wide.\nI curled my taloned toes into the dry ground, watching him. His brown fingers slipped over the marble and that same joy illuminated his face, the joy he had known in the house with me. It was a thing worthy of poetry, too, that expression, but still I had no words.\n\u201cDo you see here, the shape of your wing!\u201d\nHe was careless, as I would tell myself for years afterward, and I could not be blamed. This piece of marble was not new to him, so his words and reaction said. He had courted this marble for weeks perhaps, for he was well familiar with it. How long, I wondered as I walked toward him; yesterday he had summoned the courage to enter our house, but before then, how many times had he walked through the olive trees to reach this ruin?\n\u201cYou would coax me from this stone?\u201d\nI hated to admit that the idea appealed to me, that I wanted to see what he would make of this block. He opened his book and laid it flat upon a neighboring column, opening it to the page the quill marked, the sketch he had made. From his pouch, he withdrew a horn of ink and dipping his quill, began to draw anew.\n\u201cI would,\u201d he said, not looking up from his work. \u201cDoes this place belong to you? Your sisters?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d I stepped onto the first terrace and plucked a seashell from the dirt. \u201cBut you have been here before.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes.\u201d His smile was quick, like a fish before it vanishes underwater; his hand never slowed against the page. \u201cCan\u2019t you see \u2014 look here.\u201d The line of ink spread down the page, mimicking the curve of my hip. He added a fold of fabric over the line where feathers turned to flesh. \u201cAnd this.\u201d The quill moved to add my hair, loose in the wind and spreading over the high ridge of my shoulder and wing, and then the slight dip in the bottom of my chin.\nI lifted my hand to cover my chin. How long had he studied me? When his quill at last paused and he looked up, my skin had grown heated under the idea of his scrutiny.\n\u201cWill you allow it?\u201d\n\u201cIf I say no, surely you will still return.\u201d\nI dropped my hand and moved up to the second terrace, closer to him. I kept my wings lifted, so they wouldn\u2019t drag through the dust, my back straight. The wind picked up and took with it my hair, spreading it backward, though not half so elegantly as his ink had done.\nHis expression faltered as if to say of course he would return. He said nothing, only watched me as I approached the broken stone wall and carefully set the seashell atop it.\n\u201cI will,\u201d I said. It was folly, this venture.\n\u201cAnd will you sit for me?\u201d He gestured to his book. \u201cTranslating from page to marble can lack fire, but if you were here\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDo you not fear me?\u201d I rounded the wall, crossing the temple ruin to stand near him, keeping the marble square between us. \u201cYou know the fate of men who come to this island.\u201d\nThe young man nodded and gestured toward the meadows behind me. \u201cYou walked me through them intentionally, did you not? I know well the fate of men here.\u201d He waited a breath and then, \u201cIs it true what they say, that if a mortal man does pass your kind by, you perish?\u201d\nI flinched as if struck. \u201cWho tells these stories?\u201d\nHe returned to his book. \u201cThe men who write history. Your sisters \u2014 or rather, your sister-kind, sang for Odysseus, did they not? He escaped them and they perished for want of him.\u201d\nMy laugh was startling even to my own ears in the otherwise quiet clearing. As the sound faded, a distant bird seemed to pick it up, singing. \u201cIs that the story?\u201d I leaned into the marble, pressing my cheek to the shaded side of the stone. \u201cWould every woman perish because a man leaves her for some better adventure?\u201d\nStill, he had half of the truth of it. If refused, we did tend to grow angry, hateful. We were vain creatures \u2014 how like Narcissus \u2014 for didn\u2019t this young man appeal to my own vanity with his marble folly? Didn\u2019t refusal prick the spine of every living creature, be they mortal or no? His eyes met my own.\n\u201cWhat is your name, ladybird?\u201d\nNo one had ever asked me such a thing. Just as refusal might prick, so too did regard. I pushed away from the marble. \u201cLeave before sundown,\u201d I said and with that, returned to the house.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cThat mortal smells sweet, of ink and sweat.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you doing with him?\u201d\n\u201cPlaying,\u201d I said, rather than admit to my own vanity and curiosity.\n\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t leave by sun\u2014\u201d\nI drew in a breath and reached for another melon. I brought the melon down hard against the edge of the hearth to spilt it wide open. \u201cI know.\u201d\nThey smiled, for men had been warned before. Being allowed to stay was one thing. So many believed they had been given sanctuary, but come sundown \u2014\nI sang with my sisters over the course of the day, thinking I could feel the progress of the sun as it crossed the sky. It was a steadily moving line of light along the curve of my skull, the dip of my back, down to my very talons.\nBy the time the sun dipped below the horizon, we had left the house, tracking the three mortals we had given up to the meadow. These men were drunk on mead and laughing, trying to mimic the songs they had heard us sing during the day. They would never have seen us coming, but we shrieked, because we loved to see them run.\nThere was always a moment, just as in the room with a man, when he changed. When the song slipped into him and the tremble became the stillness. So too on the hunting field, though it was the reverse. When the man realized he was in peril for his life, he changed. His feet no longer operated as he remembered; the mead seemed too sweet on his tongue and he cursed himself, because the night-dark meadow was a blur around him. One stone looked much like another. Had he passed this patch of crocus and anemone before? No, that wasn\u2019t a stone, but a \u2014 A body?\nMy prey\u2019s scream pierced the night. I dove, the warm night air skimming over my wings. As I neared the man, he stumbled over a pile of bones. My talons in his back sent him fully to the ground.\nDust rose in a cloud around us as we struggled. Though he was drunk and well-pleasured, he fought as though clear-headed. His fists caught me in all the soft places and once across my jaw, which had me biting my tongue. I snarled, spat blood, and dug my talons into his gut, pulling to feel the warm spill of blood. I disliked this part, for surely Zeus in all his wisdom should have created us with beaks. I wanted to tear this man apart with beak and mouth, but had only hands and talons.\nThey sufficed.\nAs I rested my head against the now-still man and pulled a strip of muscle away from the bone, I prayed that the young marble cutter had left the island. The day had been long and I was hungry.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIt was peculiar to watch my face materialize from the stone. Only once did the young man come to my column perch, to touch his marble-dusted fingers to the line of my cheek as if confirming the way it sat beneath the skin. After that, it seemed he knew every line of my form. His tools coaxed these lines from the marble, somehow adding shadow and light to the folds of linen, and wind to the rising arc of my wings. It was like looking in a pool of water on a still day.\nMy sisters grew curious about the statue and the young man. I warned them away from both, yet still found my youngest sister poking around the temple ruin after one hunt. The sight of her fingers against the line of my marble cheek was chilling; she stroked blood over the marble and her teeth flashed when I discovered her.\n\u201cVanity,\u201d she said, then spat. The globule of bloody spit landed against the emerging marble bosom, trailing down the curve of one linen-covered breast. \u201cDoes he worship you?\u201d\nThe idea was intriguing, but I didn\u2019t think it was true. It wasn\u2019t worship, the way one would bend a knee to the gods. It was study, perhaps, examination. The careful transference of a thing from body to stone. Was it my spirit he captured? I did not know.\nMy sister found the hammer lying in the dirt and she curled her fingers around it. She swung her arm, sending the hammer into the uncarved marble. Small bits of stone rained outward and pattered on the ground. I drew back, feeling as though I had been struck.\n\u201cLeave it alone,\u201d I said. I felt protective of the statue, as though it were somehow mine, or truly a part of me.\nShe lifted the hammer again. \u201cWould you harm me over this?\u201d She swung the hammer again, letting it work a little divot into the stone. \u201cThis thing is only stone, as the gorgons might create \u2014 but theirs comes in an instant. How flawed this mortal design is.\u201d\nHer arm came up and I lunged. I struck her as the hammer came down, this time into my shoulder. The pain was blinding and my wing snapped tight against my body. I lowered my head against her throat and bore her backwards, down into the dirt. Her shriek carried across the olive trees, down the island cliffsides, and into the cool ocean; she called to our sister-kind, but they did not come.\nAs we were vain, so too were we argumentative, and rarely did we wedge ourselves into an argument that was not our own. We knew how sharp siren talons were; we knew how clever the hands. My hands came around my sister\u2019s throat now, to press until she went limp and the hammer fell free. Her face darkened, her eyes rolled up, and only then did I release her. She squirmed out from under me, all legs and wings, and huddled against a broken column.\n\u201cThis,\u201d she whispered, \u201cis wrong. Choosing a mortal over your sister-kind?\u201d Her eyes sought mine in the darkness.\nI found I didn\u2019t care and it filled me with despair, but only until the young man returned. When he was there and working, my sisters were far from my mind. The house seemed a distant memory and I let the rhythm of hammer and chisel and stone lull me into another place. What is your name, ladybird? he would whisper, and I would give no answer.\nOn the warmest days, the scent of rotting flesh carried to us from the meadow. The young man didn\u2019t seem to notice or if he did, it wasn\u2019t of any consequence. His face was set in a grim line as he worked, focused wholly on the task before him. Every so often he paused, to stroke his fingers over the lines of marble, down my throat and chest. It seemed as if I no longer existed in flesh for him, but was completely entombed within the marble.\nIt was a foolish thought, yet still some part of my brain embraced it. There were nights I woke struggling to breathe for it felt as if a part of me were missing. As more of the form emerged from the marble, I felt more of my own self chipped away. In the later days, I didn\u2019t join the young man for the day\u2019s work; I buried myself in my work, destroying man after man in the meadow as if it might heal my aching heart.\nThere came a day when I did venture back to the ruin, to discover the young man\u2019s work complete. The statue stood on her block of marble, wings and arms raised to the sky, head thrown back and eyes closed, hair streaming in the wind. And yet, this woman was not me, not the me I knew. I approached her slowly, taking in the way the linen clung to her belly and down her legs. Legs as any mortal woman would possess, her feet hidden amid the folds of blowing linen. These were not my legs, nor my feet. No talons, but toes, barely visible beneath the fabric. I had once dreamed of such feet and legs, dreamed of stretching in a bed without my wings pinned beneath me. Caught between two forms \u2014 bird and woman and never truly either one. Somehow, the young man had captured this thing I had never told him.\nThe hammer rested near her feet and I closed my hand around it. I pulled myself onto the statue\u2019s base and stared the thing in the face. My cheekbones, my lips, still smudged with the memory of blood.\nThe sickening smack of metal against marble was comforting this time. Time and again, I brought the hammer down against the marble, indifferent to the chips that flew off to nick my cheeks and shoulders. Her arms came clean off, and when at last the head came free, I shrieked in triumph and followed it to the ground, obliterating it. Face and hair and beautiful cheeks turned to dust beneath the hammer\u2019s swing.\n\u201cGods, no! No!\u201d\nMy head jerked up and I stared at the young man as he ran across the temple ruin. He reached for his creation, as if he might yet piece her back together, and then for me, trying to claim the hammer. His hands and fingers bruised under the assault but eventually he pulled the tool free and flung it away. He grabbed me next, holding me by my shoulders. I shrieked.\n\u201cIt was you, ladybird\u2014\u201d\nLadybird, two things wedged together, but never their own selves.\n\u201cWanted this to remain after \u2014 After you \u2014\u201d He released me. \u201cWhat is your name, ladybird?\u201d\nI rocked back, free of his hold and stared at him, seeing in his eyes the truth. He had always known this piece of art would be his last.\n\u201cNo one may know this thing, not even you.\u201d\nI reached for the young man and he let himself be taken. I drew him into my arms and down into the flower-starred meadow with its grisly treasures. Showing him these things yet again did not bother him nor did he make an effort to escape when at last I took him to that place all men eventually find here. I made certain it was swift, to save him any agony and when he breathed his last, it was with a smile. Only then did I whisper my name into his unhearing ears.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue22\/3lbe22_story1.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"At my single word, the man in the chair arched, trying to get closer to the voice.

I hate when my sister makes that sound; that sharp intake of breath full of whisper and pain and want, and I clap my hands over my ears and wish the river would wash over her and sweep her away in a torrent of dirty brown water. It doesn\u2019t.\nHannah says something, but she\u2019s talking to the river, not to me. When everything first started, she\u2019d make me cover my ears, but I reckon she doesn\u2019t care anymore if I hear what she says back to the things that move underneath her. Above, the clouds grow thicker, and I glance at them and wet my lips.\n\u201cHurry the fuck up, Hannah,\u201d I say, and she flicks a glance back at me. Her mouth is still open.\n\u201cShut it, Debbie. You don\u2019t know nothing about it,\u201d she says, and her eyes roll up to the sky, the whites threaded with whisper-thin webs of red.\n\u201cWe have to go. There\u2019s a storm coming,\u201d I say, and she snakes a hand over her belly and then dips her fingers in the water. When they come up, they look silvered, and she smiles.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll hold off for a bit longer.\u201d Something moves near her waist, and the water changes to a color I\u2019ve never seen. There isn\u2019t a word for it. She cups her hands and lifts some to her lips and tips her head back and drinks. The way she always does.\n\u201cCome on.\u201d I mumble because it wouldn\u2019t matter if she heard me. There\u2019s an order to the things she does. The entire world could be on fire, and it wouldn\u2019t fucking matter to Hannah. She\u2019d still stand knee-high in the river, her mouth filled with water and her eyes closed.\nWhen the first droplets of rain hit, they smell of sulfur and the hot copper stink of blood. Only then does Hannah turn back. \u201cCome on. Mama\u2019s going to be mad,\u201d she says.\nHer dress is never wet when she comes out of the river. At first, I thought it was a miracle, but now I know better than to think anything so simple. Once, I tried to go into the river myself, but the water was like a thousand razor blades, and I screamed and screamed until Hannah came and pulled me out. She made me promise to never go in again and hugged me to her, and I could feel her heartbeat under her sweatshirt.\n\u201cWhat\u2019d they tell you this time,\u201d I say as she gathers up her shoes. She shakes her head. Every time she comes here I ask her, and she never tells me, and I pretend I don\u2019t care. Because even though I hate her for doing this, hate every sigh that leaks out of her, I want to know what it is that sneaks inside of her and whispers.\nOverhead, the sky rumbles, and Hannah looks back at me. \u201cI\u2019m in love,\u201d she says, and then she\u2019s running, her skirt trailing after her like mist. I run, too. There isn\u2019t anything else to do.\nThe trees provide little cover, and we tear through them, the leaves wet-slick and grasping at our skin as we pass. Hannah laughs, but it doesn\u2019t sound happy.\nMy lungs ache, but I push myself forward. My legs are longer than hers now.\nWhen the trees break, Hannah slows to a stop and adjusts her dress as she faces the house. It\u2019s a buried thing, set back at least five miles from the road. The front porch sags and the third stair is missing. Mama pried it up last winter to burn in the fireplace because she wanted the living room to feel cozy. Two years ago, we painted it Robin\u2019s egg blue, but the paint had been cheap, and it was already fading into streaks. Striations of toothpaste white against the color of sky. Mama hated it. Said it made us look like trash.\nMama\u2019s in the doorway, and she has her lips pressed together so hard it looks like she\u2019s got no mouth at all.\nHannah stands there like she\u2019s frozen, just looking at the house and at Mama, and it\u2019s as if there\u2019s a glitch in the world. Like nothing\u2019s allowed to move or breathe or blink, and then Hannah twitches, and everything starts up again, and the sky opens above us, and we\u2019re both running onto the porch.\nMama touches our shoulders with the tips of her fingers as we move past her as if she\u2019s trying to remember that we\u2019re real, that the things she sent out into the world earlier that afternoon have returned with their flesh and blood and bone intact.\n\u201cWhere were y\u2019all?\u201d Mama says, and I look down. She\u2019s asking Hannah. Not me.\n\u201cThe river. Looking for fish.\u201d\n\u201cDid you get in the water?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Hannah says, and I keep my eyes down because I don\u2019t want Mama to read the lie there.\nMama left the door open after we came inside, and a fine mist pearls against our skin. My mouth tastes of water, and I swallow down all of that nothing and wonder what it would be like if it was river water instead of rain.\nMama sighs. \u201cGo on and change out of your clothes. Looks like it\u2019s going to be a nasty storm.\u201d\n\u201cMy clothes aren\u2019t wet,\u201d Hannah says.\n\u201cThen don\u2019t change. But if you catch a cold because you were out running around in a damned rainstorm, it\u2019s your own fault.\u201d\nMama turns away from us, and Hannah heads down the hallway to our bedrooms, and I pause between them and look back at Mama. She stares out into the storm, her mouth turning down at the corners, and then she closes the front door and leans her forehead against it.\nDown the hallway, Hannah closes her door, too.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to change,\u201d I whisper, and Mama looks up at me and gives a kind of half smile.\n\u201cOkay. Dinner will be soon.\u201d\nMy feet stick against the slats of the wood floors, and I let myself into my bedroom and close the door. My t-shirt makes a sucking sound as I peel it off, and I drop it on the floor in a wet heap.\nThe air from the vent is cold, and I shiver and rub my hands against my arms, but it doesn\u2019t warm me up from the bones outward the way I want it to. Hannah is in her bedroom, and she\u2019s humming something high and sweet. I think I might be sick.\nI pull a pair of sweat pants and another T-shirt out of my dresser and yank it over my head. I don\u2019t bother with a bra because it\u2019s just me and Mama and Hannah here, and we\u2019ve all seen boobs before, and it\u2019s more comfortable this way.\nMama\u2019s in the kitchen clanging around, throwing pots and pans down on the stove to tell us she\u2019s angry. I don\u2019t know why it is she doesn\u2019t want us in the river, why every time we come back she asks if we stepped into it. I\u2019ve asked hundreds of time, but she only shakes her head and tells me that she\u2019s my Mama, and it\u2019s for my own good.\nI try to read my faded copy of Jane Eyre, but I can\u2019t concentrate, not even on the good parts where Jane and Mr. Rochester finally admit they love each other. Normally my skin would feel like it\u2019s on fire, and something would be fluttering away in my gut, but tonight the words look all jumbled together, and all I feel is cold.\nWhen Mama calls that supper\u2019s ready, Hannah doesn\u2019t come out of her room. Mama and I eat in silence, our bites small and careful, and look everywhere but at each other. I poke at the limp pasta on my plate and when enough time has passed, scrape the noodles into the garbage. I\u2019m fairly certain Mama didn\u2019t eat either, but she leaves the kitchen, and then I hear her bedroom door close, and it\u2019s dead quiet in the house. I want to scream until my throat feels shredded just so I can hear something, but instead, I go to my bedroom and pull back the quilt on my bed and crawl beneath it.\nI count to three hundred before I hear my door open.\n\u201cI told you to stop coming in here,\u201d I say, but Hannah slips inside, closes the door behind her, and shuffles forward.\n\u201cI can\u2019t sleep,\u201d she says, and I turn over and face the wall.\n\u201cSo don\u2019t sleep in your own room.\u201d\nShe sits on the edge of my bed, but I can\u2019t feel the weight of her. \u201cI can still taste it,\u201d she says.\n\u201cTaste what?\u201d\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d\nMy skin flames. \u201cThen stop coming in here. I don\u2019t want to hear another fucking word about it, Hannah. You come in my bedroom, and you say this shit, and then you tell me I can\u2019t know about it. Get out of my room.\u201d\nHannah reaches for me, and I squirm away. \u201cWhy do you think she doesn\u2019t want us getting in the water?\u201d She\u2019s leaned close, and her breath streams warm over my face. \u201cWhere do you think we come from, Debbie?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Here?\u201d\nHannah flicks her eyes to the window and then back to me. \u201cHere,\u201d she says.\nI kick out so that my legs connect with her leaning frame. \u201cJesus. Just get out,\u201d I say.\nShe brings her fingers to her lips and then stands. \u201cShe fell in love, too. Once. A long time ago. The first time, she loved him. The second time, she didn\u2019t. It won\u2019t be like that for me. It won\u2019t,\u201d she says and then her hair billows out behind her as if it\u2019s caught underwater, and she\u2019s gone.\nFor a long time, I keep my eyes closed and hope for sleep, but my eyelids feel like sandpaper, and so I open them and trace the shadows over the ceiling instead. They shift and bloat like the throat of a frog, and I flex my toes under my quilt and wish again that I was an only daughter.\nMama never talks about our father, but she says we look like him. Eyes the color of the night sky and hair that kinks and frizzes even when it isn\u2019t humid out. For as long as I can remember, it\u2019s been just us, living among the trees and sky, and I didn\u2019t want anything different until last year, when Hannah found the water. Now, I only want her to stop, to go back to telling me scary stories whenever Mama has to work late, or making cookies on Saturday nights and watching old black and white movies because it would make us more cultured, or catching fireflies in the early summer evenings, our faces lit up green as we chased each other through the dark. If she won\u2019t go back to who she was, I just want her to go away.\nWhen I fall asleep, I don\u2019t dream.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe light has gone late summer morning golden when Hannah walks up the drive, and I jump away from the window so she won\u2019t know I was watching for her. My hands are heavy in my lap, and I trace the tip of my thumb over the lifeline inside my right palm. It feathers in too many places, and I press my hands together and watch my sister come through the door.\nShe pauses when she sees me, and her head twitches like she\u2019s trying to shake water from her hair, but she\u2019s dry as a bone.\n\u201cYou went to the river,\u201d I say, but it isn\u2019t a question. I can smell it on her. That deep, earthy scent of rot and ancient things brought to the surface. I wrinkle my nose and breathe through my mouth, but it doesn\u2019t help.\n\u201cI needed to see him. Needed to know.\u201d\n\u201cKnow what?\u201d\nShe threads her fingers together, and I can see her knuckles are scraped, and there\u2019s blood on her mouth. \u201cIf he loves me, too.\u201d\nInside of this moment, I hate my sister. Hate her for her delicate, doll mouth twisted up in the corners, the blood staining her lips berry red. Hate her for the deep flush running across her chest and the salt stain of tears on her cheeks. Hate her because she\u2019s found something that makes her beautiful and whole, and I hate her because I don\u2019t understand it.\n\u201cShut up,\u201d I say. She looks past me and out the window, and I know she isn\u2019t seeing me, isn\u2019t hearing me. She\u2019s inside the river, the roiling water closing over her legs and belly, her mouth full of the things that move through the dark underneath.\n\u201cI can make him forget about her. I can make him forget.\u201d\nAnger blossoms hard as granite in my chest. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re talking about. It\u2019s just water. You\u2019re making things up.\u201d\nBefore I can draw another breath, my sister is on top of me, her hand pulled back, and then she brings her palm shuddering down against my jaw. The room lights up in tiny white stars, and I bring my hand to my cheek, but it does nothing to ease the stinging heat.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll forget her. Forget the feel of her in the water, the taste of her skin when she drew her inside of him. He will forget.\u201d Hannah\u2019s words are sharp, and she hurls them at me like stones. I shrink back, and she shakes her head. She blinks, and then she\u2019s out the door again. I watch her through the window until her dark form is a faded smear. When she disappears, I sink to the floor, but I keep my eyes trained on the horizon. I want to see her when she comes trudging back, and once she does, I\u2019ll tell Mama everything. Open my mouth and spill out all of the secrets I\u2019ve stuffed into places I try not to look.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBy the time Mama pulls into the gravel drive, the sun has begun to set and shadows have sneaked into the corners of the yard. I don\u2019t move even though my legs hurt from sitting so still for so long.\nWhen Mama opens the door, her eyes go straight to me like she already knew that I\u2019d be waiting, like she\u2019s been waiting for this moment.\n\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Mama says, and I point. Mama nods. There isn\u2019t anything else to say, and so Mama comes in the house, kicking her shoes off next to the door, and sinks into the couch. Together we watch the window until it goes dark.\nWhen the moon glazes over our skins, I finally speak. \u201cShe\u2019s not coming back, is she?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe. Maybe not. You should sleep.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not tired,\u201d I say.\n\u201cGo to bed, Deborah,\u201d Mama says, and her voice scrapes over me, sharp as glass, and I do as she says.\nI lie on top of the quilt, and listen to my mother breathing in the next room. In and out. Jagged rhythms that paint the muted colors of her memories that lie thick and bitter on her tongue. It\u2019s a strange thought, but it\u2019s what I think all the same. I should write it down before I forget.\nI fall asleep to the sound of her crying.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI whisper, but the sound is too quiet. Even if she could hear me, she\u2019s probably fallen asleep waiting for Hannah to come home, her body curled into itself as if she can keep everything soft and delicate from falling out.\nThe floor is cold beneath my feet, and I have to thrust my hands in front of me so I don\u2019t trip and fall, but I find my way to the door and open it. The hallway stretches impossibly, the color bled from the walls and floor, and there is only dark, only the vague shapes of our furniture beyond. I move slowly, my hands against my throat as if my thin fingers could ward off whatever teeth come hunting meat in the night.\nMama isn\u2019t in the living room, and the front door stands open. The air here is humid and thick, and I go to the door and close it. My hands tremble, but I throw the lock, too.\nI know I should go looking for them, know I should go to the river, but everything inside of me has turned breakable, and I think if I saw them there, the dark water flowing around them, I would start screaming and never stop.\nInstead, I tuck myself next to the window and wait for the sun to come up.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhen the sun begins to set, I go to the front door and open it. From my spot on the front porch, I watch the trees and wonder if Mama and Hannah are behind them. If they can see me from wherever they\u2019ve hidden themselves. But then I think of them in the river, their bloated, pale faces staring up at me from under the water. I go inside. I lock the door again.\nI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whisper because I think my sister\u2019s drowned, and I didn\u2019t want it to be like this. I only wanted her to stop. And now Mama\u2019s drowned, too, and I\u2019m alone in this house in the middle of these terrible trees. I bite down on a sob. What if whatever\u2019s in the trees were to hear?\nI fall asleep, but it\u2019s uneasy. I dream of Hannah, her eyes leaking river water as she writhes against the bank, her back arched toward the sky, and her fingers between her legs.\nIt\u2019s the sound that wakes me up. A flutter of breath and then a small sigh. Hannah, I think, but there\u2019s no footsteps clattering up the stairs. Just that one, small sigh. My heart pumps heavy in my chest, and I force myself up, force myself to look out the window.\nSomething moves fast over the grass, a dark shape crawling on all fours. Before it disappears, it turns back. Its eyes reflect yellow and blue and green \u2014 the colors of water in the sunlight \u2014 and then it\u2019s gone.\nI don\u2019t sleep for the rest of the night.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThere are streaks of dirt against the door as if someone had pressed a hand there. I glance at the trees, but nothing moves beyond them. They are only trees. Only leaves and wind and earth. I swallow, and then I\u2019m stepping off the porch and forcing myself to move.\nIf Mama and Hannah are at the river, I\u2019ll find them. I\u2019ll pull them out and bring them home, and we\u2019ll leave this place. Leave everything behind and find somewhere else to be.\nSomewhere new where there isn\u2019t a river.\nThe ground is damp, and it pulls at my feet, tries to drag me down into the earth. I wonder if that\u2019s where Mama and Hannah went. Under the water and back into the dirt like Persephone who we read about in school.\nWhen I come through the trees, the river is the same as it always is. I\u2019m not sure what I expected. Perhaps for it to be roiling, white caps churned into foam, or the water bloodied and coated with a slick of grease. It\u2019s only blue sky and a bright haze of sun and the river curling toward some end I\u2019ll never see. No Mama. No Hannah.\nI don\u2019t go into the river. Even though it looks so cool, and the sun beats against my shoulders. I remember the feeling of all those little mouths pushing against my skin, their teeth looking for the love Hannah offers. I\u2019m not sure what it is Mama offered.\nInstead, I sit on the bank and pull up handfuls of grass. Toss them into the air and watch them flutter down like blades of emeralds. A locust moves jerkily across the bank and then disappears into the water. I wonder if before whatever is beneath snatched him away, if he fell in love, too.\nI push myself onto my belly and scoot forward so that I can see over the lip of the bank and into the water. My reflection is distorted. My eyes are too large and my mouth twists into a grimace. Overhead, the trees dip toward the earth, and for a moment it\u2019s as if they are in the water instead of above it, and I scrub a hand across my face.\n\u201cHannah,\u201d I whisper to the water. \u201cMama.\u201d The faces of my mother and my sister don\u2019t materialize, and I push my hands into the dirt and squeeze and squeeze until my fingers go numb.\n\u201cFuck you,\u201d I say and spit into the water. Nothing happens.\nSomething cries out from the trees. A bird or an animal. I can\u2019t be sure which. It isn\u2019t human.\nI spend the rest of the day laid flat next to the river, staring up at the sky, and ignoring the click in my throat every time I swallow.\n\u201cYou\u2019re waiting for when it\u2019s dark,\u201d I mumble into the sky.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhen Mama comes, she doesn\u2019t come out of the water, but out of the trees. \u201cI was in love with him, too. A long time ago. I\u2019d go into the water and he\u2019d pour every beautiful thing inside of me, and I\u2019d forget there was a world beyond the veil he\u2019d torn. That there were people and an entire life waiting somewhere else that didn\u2019t taste of water.\u201d\nShe draws a ragged breath. \u201cI still loved him when Hannah came. Still thought he\u2019d take us away, but he didn\u2019t. And then the second time.\u201d Her voice trails off, and I turn to look at her. Her eyes glint back at me. \u201cI never went back into the water after that.\u201d\nI don\u2019t ask her what he is. It doesn\u2019t matter.\nMama comes on hands and knees, and she touches my hair, my face. She presses cold lips to my cheek and speaks. I don\u2019t know what it is she says.\nWhen she slips into the water, she doesn\u2019t cry out, but she looks back at me, and her eyelids flutter, and her mouth drops open, and I know she doesn\u2019t see me anymore.\nI reach a hand for her, but then let it drop. Like a dream, Mama moves away from me, and the river rises to meet her thighs, her breasts, her neck.\nShe turns back. \u201cYou were never supposed to be mine. Not truly. But I never knew how to do anything but love you. My girls. Born of the water,\u201d she says, and then the river covers her mouth, her nose, and she\u2019s gone.\nI think the river will make some small sound when I rise, but it doesn\u2019t call out for me as I walk away.\nI go back to the house. I leave the door open behind me and lie down on the couch.\nIn the morning, Hannah will be home.\nIn the morning, we\u2019ll leave this place, and we\u2019ll forget the sound of the river.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue30\/3lbe30_story1.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"Hannah lifts her skirt above her knees, the blue floral print a harsh, discordant pattern against the smooth green lining the rocks she steps over, and wades into the river.

I still remember the urgency in his voice and the way his hands shook as he closed the blackout blinds. I still remember the fear in his eyes.\nAbove all else, fire is indifferent. It only wants to burn. It will do whatever it takes to gulp down oxygen and race across defenseless dry brush, without malice or regret. It is a cosmic devourer on a human scale, with thick smoke that chokes out the sun and a fierce glow that blots out the stars. It will hypnotize you, swallow you, burn your brain from the inside out.\nFire took my father away. It can never be beautiful to me, and so I am the perfect firefighter.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe strengthening breeze plasters my sweaty bangs to my forehead as I climb up the back road to the tallest cliffside. It\u2019s a hot day, and dry, the worst kind of heat. Dangerous.\nOn the cliff\u2019s sheer face, the fire department\u2019s goats climb as freely as I walk. It does not escape my notice that these goats are more trusted employees than the inmates that make up half our firefighting crew, but I can\u2019t allow myself to think about that. Instead, I focus on the goats themselves. They work hard, grazing on the fire-prone undergrowth to help us clear the cliffs we cannot scale. They are graceful, vital, beautiful.\nAlthough the goats do their best to keep nature\u2019s kindling under control, we still need fire once in a while. Some herbs and flowers thrive under the shock of heat and the taste of ash, fire poppies and whispering bells and all sorts of blossoming phacelia. These fire followers, the good kind, spring up in delicate droves after every wildfire, as if summoned to consecrate the charred earth. They are beautiful like the goats, especially by comparison to the fire that births them.\nAt the very top of the cliff, watching her goats with an expression both fond and firm, is Cordelia, my favorite goatherd. She turns and greets me with a hearty wave. Cordelia is beautiful too, another thing I cannot think about.\n\u201cIs it time already, Emmie?\u201d she asks. \u201cI thought y\u2019all weren\u2019t starting the burn until the afternoon.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re predicting that the wind will pick up, so we\u2019ve got to start now.\u201d I shove my hands in my pockets, fidgeting with my wildfire glasses, and make an attempt at small talk. \u201cHow are your goats today?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing fine, but this dry heat is getting to us all. I\u2019ll be glad if the wind comes. Bluebell here almost fainted on a ledge.\u201d Cordelia gestures to Bluebell, the smallest goat of the herd. She is resting in the shade of a nearby boulder. Her rope lead snakes through the weeds like an unlit fuse.\n\u201cPoor girl. Here, I can watch her while you get the others.\u201d I pick up the loose end of Bluebell\u2019s rope and sit atop the boulder as Cordelia calls back the grazing goats. The breeze blows stronger, but it brings no relief, only more hot air. Heat haze shimmers far below us on the gridlocked canyon road. When I squint, an immaterial roiling lake spills out across the asphalt.\nBluebell stands bolt upright, focusing her rectangular pupils on the other side of the canyon.\n\u201cWhat do you see, Bluebell?\u201d I pat her on the back and peer across the canyon, but it\u2019s too bright for me to see anything. Bluebell bleats and strains her legs but stands rigid, as if she is trapped in molten tar. I frown.\n\u201cHey, Emmie?\u201d Cordelia\u2019s herd surrounds her now. Between the goats and the wind and the car horns from the traffic down below, I can barely hear her. \u201cDo you smell that?\u201d\nI smell only sunscreen and sweat.\n\u201cNo, but can you come look at Bluebell?\u201d I call out to Cordelia. The little goat trembles beside me. Her fur is hot to the touch. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong, maybe heatstroke.\u201d\nCordelia heads over to me with her back to the canyon, and that is what saves her.\nThe scent of the wildfire finally hits me just as I see its flames crest the opposite cliff. It smells familiar, like soot and death. Its hypnotic swirls and eddies lick at my mind with a thousand red-hot tongues, searing their shape into my synapses, tugging me toward the edge. I tear my gaze away.\n\u201cCordelia, look at me,\u201d I say, fixing my eyes on hers and trying to strike a balance between authoritative and comforting. \u201cKeep looking at me. There\u2019s a fire across the canyon. Don\u2019t turn around.\u201d\nTo her credit, Cordelia barely flinches at the news. Cliffside work isn\u2019t for the faint of heart. Instead, she sets her jaw and marches toward me, urging her goats forward. As the herd crosses Bluebell\u2019s line of sight, the struggling goat relaxes. Her mind has bounced back in the way that Cordelia\u2019s wouldn\u2019t.\n\u201cYou\u2019re almost here.\u201d My voice becomes gentler now that she is close. I reach out to her, wildfire glasses in hand. \u201cJust a few more steps. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d\nSomeone screams in the canyon.\nBecause I don\u2019t look, because I have hardened my heart, I see instead Cordelia\u2019s face as she turns. There is no fear in her eyes. Perhaps this was what Lot\u2019s wife heard in the desert of old, and perhaps her choice to look back was also no choice at all. Perhaps this was what my father heard during that last shift just weeks before his parole. When a truly kind person hears a cry of \u201chelp,\u201d they turn, and no threat of salt or flame will stop them. As for me, I don\u2019t turn. I fight.\nThe goats scatter out of my way as I sprint to Cordelia\u2019s side. I\u2019ve trained to run like this, to race against flame, when every second counts. I slide my filtered glasses over her eyes and hope like hell that I was fast enough.\nScreams continue down at the base of the cliffs. Some voices leave the chorus of fear, picked off one by one by the sight of flames above, but there seems to be no end to the panic. I don\u2019t blame them. I screamed too, long ago. Up here atop the canyon, the goats begin to wander off, adrift without their leader\u2019s guidance. Cordelia brings her hands to the glasses, slowly, like her fingers are dragging through lava.\n\u201cEmmie?\u201d She tilts her head toward me. Recognition is an excellent sign, and she\u2019s turned away from the fire. For a moment, I think I\u2019ve protected her entirely, but then a rapturous smile spreads across her face. \u201cOh, Emmie, I just saw the most beautiful thing\u2026\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHer smile does not waver even as I place her in one of the station\u2019s dark rooms, the chilly, windowless kind we keep empty for afflicted firefighters. When I take back my glasses, I can see that her eyes are alight with joy and memory. Cordelia will have a long road to recovery, and she may never fully shake the thrall of fire, but at least she is not dead or dying in the burn ward. At least she is not a charred pillar atop the cliff.\nSweet little Bluebell presses her nose into my palm as I check for civilian reports from our corner of Orange County. I need to get out there and face the fireline, but first, I must know the size and shape of my death.\nThe wildfire is small but spreading fast. With the wind and the aridity and my fellow firefighters caught far from their gear, I find myself in the peaceful eye of a perfect storm. If the flames leap the highway, as they have in the past, even the station itself could be at risk. There\u2019s no use waiting to see if anyone makes it back from the traffic jam.\nI sound the alarm. The goats flee into the depths of the station and circle back again, helpless against the noise and light. They echo the blaring of the klaxon with their distinctive wavering screams. In the midst of this, the fire chief steps out of the barracks, shifting seamlessly from drowsy to alert.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the situation, Hernandez?\u201d he asks, reaching for his uniform and visored helmet. \u201cDid your burn break containment?\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t even get a chance to start it, sir.\u201d I start pulling on my gear. \u201cSomething ignited over by the mountains. I\u2019m assuming zero containment, and the rest of the crew is stuck in the canyon. We could be looking at a mass follower incident.\u201d\nThe chief nods and looks over my shoulder, assessing my thrown-together sighting map. Bluebell chews on one corner of the paper.\n\u201cAnd the goats?\u201d he asks. I grimace.\n\u201cI was with the goatherd when we spotted the flames. Didn\u2019t get to her fast enough. She\u2019s in a dark room for now.\u201d\n\u201cGood call. Can you handle setting the fireline?\u201d The chief tries not to be fatherly, but I can see the urge to comfort me simmering behind his eyes. The similar circumstances to those of my father\u2019s death are undeniable. When the firestorm hit, his sentence was almost through. The inmate firefighters were the only team close enough to respond. He loved his work, but sometimes a choice is not a choice.\n\u201cI can handle it.\u201d I flip down my visor and march out into the blazing light, trusting the chief to back me up by coordinating the county\u2019s response. I leave Bluebell, and I leave the transfixed creature that was once Cordelia, and I do not turn back.\nThrough the dim filter of my helmet, I can see that a massive fireline has formed across the highway. Civilians make up most of the line, but I can see a few of my colleagues too, caught unaware when the blaze crested the hills. They are safe in the canyon in the same way that tea in a kettle is safe from drinking. They have not become fire followers yet.\nUnlike the rooted blossoms of their namesakes, human fire followers are fiercely mobile. Nothing can stop them from steadily tracing the path of the nearest flames. Nothing except the fire itself, of course, because flesh is only flesh and bone is only bone. To set the fireline, we need to make sure that these people don\u2019t get in our way. It\u2019s an ugly task with an ugly purpose.\nI glance at the flames atop the cliff, shielded from their effects by my helmet. The fire\u2019s rate of spread is worse than I thought. The wind continues to strengthen, whipping embers through the brush while the flames start their slow descent to the highway. As I leave the firehouse alarm behind me, its clamor is replaced with the familiar whine of engine sirens, climbing to a fever pitch as all the stations in striking distance respond to the chief\u2019s call. Help is coming. They\u2019re counting on me to clear the way.\nIt feels strange, almost sacrilegious, to run towards a fire empty-handed. Only my uniform sets me apart from the yearning masses trapped at the base of the canyon. If I just looked a little longer, I could join them. I could finally understand how hot a brain must burn to choose flames over life.\nNo one in the fireline notices when I stumble breathless onto the highway. They\u2019ve left their cars and taken up watch all along the asphalt, parents with children, fathers with daughters. They don\u2019t notice each other, either. They just watch the fire.\nI\u2019m not ready when the first one blooms. The man is half my size, scrawny, but you wouldn\u2019t know it from how fast he moves. He bolts for the cliffside and starts climbing up to meet the blaze. I steel myself for what I am about to do, and then I go to the man and push him face-first into the flames.\nThis protocol is a kinder, faster fate. It\u2019s the death I would have wanted my father to have, not the prolonged agony of the burn ward. Besides, the thing they dragged away and bandaged up and locked away \u2014 that wasn\u2019t my father anymore. Not on the inside.\nI maintain the fireline until the engines pull up.\n\u201cGood work, Hernandez,\u201d my coworker Monroe calls from the cab of our station\u2019s engine. He and Silvia, in the passenger seat, are wearing the unmistakable orange uniforms that mark them as members of the inmate fire camp. The same uniform my father wore.\nNow that my backup has arrived, we can at least try to fight for the remaining victims, the ones who are still standing joyfully in line. We cover their eyes with filtered glasses and tuck them back into their cars even as we uncoil hoses and chop through dry bushes. I grab an axe and set to carving out a break at the base of the cliff. If we can starve this fire, we might be able to make a stand here.\nAs I hack away at the undergrowth, though, I see smoldering embers sail past me with each gust of wind. They land on cars, on people, on asphalt. Our luck won\u2019t hold for long.\nJust as I activate my intercom to warn the others, a commotion breaks out behind me. Several members of the fireline have started moving at once, tripping over hoses and firefighters alike in their desperate rush toward the fire. One woman pushes me forward with such force that I fall against the burning cliffside. There is a dull crunch as my helmet strikes solid rock.\nIt takes me a moment to get my bearings again. I had been facing the fire, but I have fallen and turned and I am still facing the fire, and now it is also behind me and above me.\nWhen I see firefighters running for their engines, I realize that the wildfire has jumped the highway. Flames streak up the opposite cliff, consuming everything the goats didn\u2019t manage to clear. Fire followers spring into action all around me like popping corn. In the distance, I hear superheated gas tanks explode.\nThe fire is everywhere now. Its seductive force is inescapable. Firefighters halfway into their cabins go still and stare even as their drivers stomp on their pedals and speed away. I grit my teeth and run for something, somewhere, but I don\u2019t know where my engine is. There\u2019s nowhere I can look that is not ablaze and I know that even I must have my limits. Still, it\u2019s not beautiful yet.\nI stumble forward, ignoring civilians and cars alike. Bodies litter the ground, some charred beyond recognition, some only knocked unconscious as the wildfire greedily sucks up oxygen. I keep moving, but I can\u2019t see the cliffs anymore. I can\u2019t even see the sky.\nA firefighter emerges from the chaos and raises a hand as if to greet me. Their uniform is inmate orange.\n\u201cMonroe?\u201d I cry out through the intercom, squinting at the firefighter\u2019s badge through the smoky haze. Even the flames reflected on that superheated brass are too much for my dazzled mind. I shut my eyes as I yell. \u201cSilvia? Whoever you are, get out now. There\u2019s nothing left.\u201d\nI feel the heat on my face, on my back, in my lungs. Violent red fire-light floods through my visor and my eyelids, overpowering every filter I have at my disposal. I open my eyes again to see the firefighter standing directly in front of me. Staring at me.\nThe flames close in. I gasp for air, choking on acrid smoke, and fight the fire with the last of my strength. The other firefighter burns, and I know it, and I know him, and I know the burning. I fight the fire, and I do not look at him \u2014 I listen to my father and I do not look at the firefighter but my father is the fire and I am the fighter and he says let me see your face, Emmie\u2014\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022\nFront & Back cover art by Rew X\n\u2022\nJulie Ireland\nBear Weiter\nCraig Church\nKelly L.\nJessica Guptill\nThomas Ha\nMaria Haskins\nLorna D.

Our progress had been delayed by angry, low clouds, a howling wind, and a discreet argument among the captain\u2019s trusted sailors.\nI was privy to nothing, but I heard a lot. I knit by the ship\u2019s stove, where the warmth gathered longest like a ghostly companion. I sewed in a nook adjacent to the captain\u2019s chamber beneath a hanging candle, and I saw all manner of visitors knock at his door. I was all but sure of the nature of his common interests with Diego, the young navigator hired at Malaga to get us all the way around the cape to Ceylon. I also knew the proud captain sought advice from the clever sailor Vasco, who was an ex-criminal with the look of a crooked man, although he had never done wrong by me.\nMany of the sailors aboard were not as kind. \u201cDarra!\u201d they screamed from the deck, expecting me to hear them over the roar of waves. \u201cThe patch you put in the seat of these slacks has torn right off in two days, you stupid bitch!\u201d\nI would go to fetch the slacks, or the shirt missing its buttons, or the boot with the flapping sole. The sailors would remove the offending items, swat me with them across the head, shout, strike me with open hands. They implored the captain to throw me overboard.\nI was not a young woman, and had borne two cherubic girls, dead of fever before their third and fifth birthdays. But I was not immune to the perverse appetites of these sailors. They curled their fists in my tailor\u2019s apron and whispered as if dying. They hurt me, cut me viciously with the cruelty of their bodies. What was I to do, on the wide ocean, with no home or family left to me at any port?\nFor all that I knew of this ship and its men \u2014 for all that I knew of their habits and secrets \u2014 I did not know what agitation delayed our landing at Beyrouth. It was a very quiet worry, a very deep one, and it was so sour aboard the Tridente that we seemed to attract the heaviest of clouds.\nAs dark as those days were, the morning we bobbed to our mooring post in that famed port of the Levant, that gateway to the East, the sun was smiling widely on the bountiful land of the Syrians. Distant snow-capped mountains shone like jellyfish in shallow water.\nIt was not long before the captain sent a boat ashore to herald our arrival. The crew prepared their belongings and what cargo was destined for trade here. I collected the extent of my possessions: one change of clothing, my sewing needles, my thread, and my enameled box of buttons.\nThe boatman soon rowed back with news that dampened the crew\u2019s mood even further. We were to report at La Quarantaine, the lazaretto of Beyrouth, before being allowed to sail for Ceylon.\nWe would be held there for no less than a fortnight by order of Ibrahim Pasha, the Ottoman ruler of Beyrouth. The boatman had been told of the Pasha\u2019s strict policy that no scourge would spread through that trading route. Vasco quipped to the captain that siphoning gold off merchant seamen was easier, too, if you forcibly held them at your port.\nI often imagined that I had a wall inside of me, and I put my back to it to steady me when my times were hard. This way I withstood hardship, and my wall only ever failed me when my girls caught the wasting fever and died within a month of each other. At this gloomy news, I pressed myself against my wall, and spoke frankly to myself \u2014 Darra, for you all destinations are interchangeable. Two weeks in quarantine mean nothing more nor less than two weeks longer at sea. You have nowhere else worth being.\nI held onto the small relief of soon walking on solid earth, and the reprieve from the creaking dark cubby holes which were my warrens aboard the ship.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe old cook and I, being the only women, were appointed our own rooms near the entrance of the lazaretto, apart from the men. When I went to relieve myself, I met a sailor named Morizio on his way out of the shared outhouse, little more than a hole in the ground.\nMorizio seemed tired, harried. We were all so, having travelled long weeks on an upset sea. But he looked more than tired. He seemed ill. Water or sweat drenched the collar of his tunic, and his eyes were wide and desperate, like those of a drowning man. He half stumbled past me, and I smelled vomit on his breath. Air was heaving out of his lungs as if from a bellows.\nMorizio had only mistreated me once to gain favor and laughs from the established crew, and so I did not think him a rotten soul. Still, facing him in that state put a shiver in my spine, and I connected the incident back to the secret commotion on board our ship.\nI began to worry that perhaps Ibrahim Pasha\u2019s men were right to detain us at La Quarantaine after all. If a terrible pestilence plagued the Tridente\u2019s crew, there was no one I could exchange thoughts with, no one I held in high enough confidence to speak to. Even if I could, what would I say?\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIt was as I stood at my window that I heard confused, gruff noises from the cook\u2019s room, followed a few instants later by a hollow patter at my door.\nI did not hesitate to unlatch the door and pull it open. There was nothing intimate to me that the world had not already ravaged, and the shelter of locked doors was not a protection I was used to.\nIn the doorway stood a child, about six years old. It had a bronzed complexion, splotchy with the spread of sweat and dust residue across its face. Its head was chaotically crowned by a rumpled nest of hair, dark as soot. Cunning eyes with big whites studied me without passing discernable judgment.\nThe urchin was of unclear gender. It wore sequined slippers with almost no sequins left upon them, billowing slacks, and a gilet in a maroon shade, torn under the left armpit. Its eyes were kohled, its lips reddened.\n\u201cWhat do you have there?\u201d I asked in Spanish. I did not expect the child to know languages, but made my voice a friendly sing-song to hold the creature on the doorstep.\nThe child carried an impressive array of items in those small arms. Its right arm and shoulder supported a chain of small ceramic cups painted with a floral motif. At least twenty of these cups slotted inside one another, snaking up to nestle in the nook of a small jaw. The left arm balanced what looked like a repurposed cigar box with two compartments, one heaped with drops of chewing resin, and the other with dragees of white sugar. Not content with this burden, the left elbow also hooked a leather and canvas bladder which sagged with a liquid content.\n\u201cCome in, little seller,\u201d I said, and swung the door wider.\nThe child shrugged the snake of cups into a safer arrangement, retreated into the shadow of the corridor, and returned nudging a marvelous rattling tricycle into my room with one foot.\nA wooden horse was hitched to an iron wheel in the front, and behind the seat, a copper pot with a long spout sat in a special net. As the youngster inched the tricycle forward, the copper pot sloshed, and the room was perfumed with the vapors of a pungent oriental coffee.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any money,\u201d I continued in Spanish, and my chest ached with the disappointment in the little one\u2019s eyes. Young as it was, the child understood blows to its livelihood dealt in any language.\nThen I had a more painful memory, of playing with my younger girl, Aleja, a game of trade. She would call on me to sell me pretty stones, hibernating snails, wilted flowers, and I would pay her with\u2026\nI lifted my pallet and fished out my enameled box of buttons.\n\u201cWill you take a few buttons?\u201d I asked, gesturing at the pot of coffee, and a sugar dragee, then selecting two buttons. I held them like coins.\nThe child\u2019s brow knitted sternly at the sight of them. It was enough to prompt a disburdening of the collection of carried wares. These the little one laid one by one on the carpeted floor, except for the chain of cups, which was first divided into five shorter stacks that would balance when set down.\nI felt a shake in my heart as this industrious creature drew near. A small hand cupped mine to examine the handsome buttons, one purple with a gilt border, the other ivory colored and patterned. I caught the child\u2019s scent--not a washed smell, but not a repulsive smell either. Earthy and musky. The closeness reminded me painfully of my daughters, and I realized this was the first child to approach me since their deaths.\nThe buttons were found to be an acceptable barter.\nAfter pocketing them, the seller unhitched the copper pot, poured a long drizzle of steaming coffee into one of the ceramic cups, and presented it to me with the box of sweets. I chose a block of sugar and put it under my tongue to dissolve. I savored the coffee over many small sips. The cardamom and cloves played a tune on my tongue.\nThe child watched me, long lashes beating when it blinked.\n\u201cNur!\u201d it announced suddenly, both palms to its chest.\n\u201cDarra,\u201d I replied, pointing at my smiling face. I did not know how to ask, so I decided the lazaretto\u2019s peddler could be a girl, like my two angels, but so unlike either of them.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe knock on the door came early. The second pair of socks still needed ribbing, and I had not readied myself for the day. I hurried to hide my unfinished knitting before opening the door.\nA large frame filled my doorway. It was Carles, a Tridente crewman. He had been especially cruel since the first time he\u2019d seen me. The day I joined the crew, the Tridente had been moored in choppy waters and driving rain, but Carles thought it amusing to let down just a thin, wobbling plank of wood for me to clamber up to reach the deck.\n\u201cDarra,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been strange to do without the services of our talented tailor since we docked.\u201d He let himself in. \u201cI\u2019d even say it has been somewhat lonely without you.\u201d\nInstinctively, I backed into my room, almost tripping on the edge of a Turkish rug where it overlaid another.\n\u201cI had planned to report to the captain today for any work to be done, sir,\u201d I replied, though I could see on the sailor\u2019s weatherworn face a message of mischief and cruelty.\nHis visit was not on the captain\u2019s behalf.\n\u201cWell, you could help me with some work to be done.\u201d Carles paused when he saw me glance at his hands. I was still hoping to find a sewing job there. He laughed merrily and approached me, grabbed the apron I had just put on, and ripped it away with a swipe.\n\u201cYou need something to fix so bad, you old bitch? Fix that, if you must. But later.\u201d\nHe cupped my jaw in a searing grip. I tottered forward to protect my craning neck. Carles studied my face as if examining a donkey foal before agreeing to a purchase.\n\u201cDamn, you ugly hag! You never looked this bad below deck in one of your little rabbitholes. What shit luck leaves a man a choice between the hairless toothless turnip next door and a hag with skin drooping from her body like a half-skinned chicken?\u201d\nAs shameful as it sounds, I willed myself to seem yet uglier, less female. I wished to myself I could have stoppered my sex with molten lead. But I knew that would hardly slow a man like Carles down. That I was a woman was an excuse. What he thirsted for was my humiliation, whatever shape that took.\nTo hold my composure, I willed myself to search Carles\u2019 face for any signs of a mysterious illness. Sweat tracked down his temples, but Beyrouth was hot; a rich sun serenaded the city every morning and left in its wake a clotted haze of day. Carles\u2019 lips were cracked, his eyes bloodshot beneath the slugs of his eyebrows.\nHe might have been in the early or last rounds of an illness, or he might have slept fitfully his first night on solid ground. It was impossible to tell.\n\u201cI cannot breathe,\u201d I mustered through a compressed throat. Carles softened his clutch on my neck then started unbuttoning his breeches with the other hand.\n\u201cA man who lives at sea must, in the end, gratify himself however he can.\u201d He shoved a hand into my skirts but was frustrated by my elastic stockings. \u201cI don\u2019t expect you to sympathize. What does an old hag know of the needs of men?\u201d\n\u201cCarles,\u201d I croaked. \u201cI am an old woman. I have buried two children. I have little left in this world. Take mercy on a woman your mother\u2019s age.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe you should speak less and work harder at getting out of your damned skirts,\u201d he said, his hand still groping.\n\u201cSir, my daughters, Casia and Aleja. Casia was five. Dark hair, sweet dark eyes. Always brown from playing in the fields.\u201d\n\u201cShut up and undress, Darra.\u201d\nHe was in no hurry in spite of his words. And he was enjoying my pleas. They fueled his wicked intent further. A sick man.\n\u201cShe died in my arms, sir. Five years old. Have mercy. Died of the fever before her life began.\u201d\nCarles shoved me to the ground, hard. I skidded painfully against the short pile of a Turkish rug. My elbow burned at the rub of the fibers.\n\u201cI would do anything to have them back,\u201d I said to no one, for Carles was preoccupied with tearing off the remnants of my stockings.\nHe laid his full weight on me as he fumbled in his breeches. My small ribs bent painfully inwards. I lay shielding my face, my thoughts tangled in another life, one where I had my babies and their playtime shouts filled a small room in our shared house in Malaga.\n\u201cDarra! Darra!\u201d A mighty little voice broke the ungodly tension, followed by a clattering. I craned my neck to find the little peddler waiting in the sharp shadow of the building, upon her tricycle. The wooden horse stood frozen just over the doorsill.\nCarles sprang back, hands cupping his half-exposed cock.\n\u201cGod in Heaven! Sorcery!\u201d\nHis reaction surprised me. I scrambled to my feet, covering myself, and found him staring wide-eyed at the urchin.\n\u201cYou spooky fucking witch, muttering about the dead, summoning a kid to save you from what you had coming,\u201d Carles babbled. Then I knew how to seize on his guilt-ridden hysteria.\n\u201cCasia, come to mother,\u201d I said in Spanish, arms out to Nur. \u201cCome, little one.\u201d\nNur scrunched her brow, uncomprehending, but my words were enough to send Carles vaulting over the tricycle horse, his eyes glued to my small rescuer the whole time.\n\u201cSupersticioso,\u201d I groaned to Nur, stepping over my shredded stockings and touching each of my sore ribs. My heart was racing with the fear I had swallowed.\nThe tricycle came rattling fully into the room. Nur had fashioned a whole stowing system between the two back wheels. It could carry not only a coffee pot, but the whole assortment of wares and the tower of ceramic cups, secured with some filthy looking netting and a sponge. The child would make a resourceful sailor.\nI decided the second pair of socks didn\u2019t need ribbing after all.\nI held out the gift to Nur, ashamed of my deep gratitude. Why should a small child have to save me from a man like Carles? Why should anyone have to save me from the decay of my life?\nNur stood from the tricycle seat and took the freshly knit socks. I pointed down at her slippers and their lonely few sequins, pitiful as featherless birds.\n\u201cAaah,\u201d came her response. She shuffled out of the slippers and pulled on a pair of socks, the ones made with good French yarn dyed plum-colored with bilberry juice. Nur bounded up and ran a joyful circuit of the small chamber in her new socks. Then she sat back down and pulled on the second pair on top of the first.\nThe spectacle cheered me, though my life had drifted so far out to sea, a fleck of flotsam upon the waves.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nCuriosity and restlessness mingled with a fear of rebuke until I decided to seek out the captain. I imagined the heap of clothes building in the corner as the captain cursed my truancy, and the richly patterned rugs of my otherwise barren room held less and less of my interest with each passing day.\nAt a whim I headed in the direction opposite the short path to the toilets. It was midday. I clutched my sewing kit under my armpit, an explanation for myself, for my wandering. Rows on rows of Ottoman style lodgings identical to mine crowded along pebbled paths, their unfinished ochre bricks sandwiched together with thick, untidy coats of mortar. The disorienting repetition under the beating sun tightened my lungs.\nWe shared the quarantine compound with several crews, judging by the number of longboats, no two alike, which had been moored along the lazaretto\u2019s promontory when we arrived.\nWith all its temporary inhabitants, the compound was a quiet place by day. At night card games sprung up around firepits and doors were left open. Once or twice I had heard the commotion of a midnight swim, big splashes as hooting sailors jumped off jutting rocks and into the black sea. But I had not seen nor heard any familiar sailors among the revelers of the night.\nI wondered how I would find the captain \u2014 especially when it seemed that the crew of the Tridente were making efforts not to be found.\nI turned corners until I had all but lost my bearings in that maze of lodgings. When I began to follow the sound of the ocean, hoping to reorient myself by the coastline, another sound captured my ears.\nHanging in the heavy, waterlogged atmosphere was the susurrus of animals. As I approached I recognized it as the wheezing and agitated neighing of horses.\nThen a terrible smell struck me, a cloying stench as of a half-spoilt egg sitting in a platter of raw meat in the sun. I came upon the source: a courtyard scene of commotion, and three unsettled horses on reins held by Turkish guards. Several others, their heads tarbooshed or bare, gathered around a bloodied, battered human body. Blotches of red hoofprints stained the pebbled earth. The smell enveloped me, carried on tendrils of heat shimmering in the bright-lit court.\nI ventured closer, my apron bunched up before my nose. In the remains of a face caved in by a hoof-sized crater I recognized Rafael, a rigsman who had joined the Tridente\u2019s crew right before the start of our previous voyage. He had been trampled completely, in places nearly flattened, doused in blood. My thoughts turned immediately to murder, for an accident of fate, even involving a stampede of three horses, could not have so completely destroyed a man\u2019s body. I thought again about the anxious whispering on board our ship, and our delay making port at Beyrouth.\n\u201cDarra! Get back to your room! Nobody called for you.\u201d It was the captain, his voice muffled by the thick ball of cloth held to his face. Despite the heat, he was dressed formally in tailed longcoat and breeches. I was close enough as he turned to me to see that the whites of his eyes were gummied and pink. He was drenched in sweat.\nBefore bowing my head to the captain, I scanned the scowling faces of the gathered Tridente crewmen: Morizio, the African oarsman Abau, Vasco, Carles, red-haired Hermann. Their eyes wept, whether in sickness or grief I could not tell, and they sweated through heavy garments otherwise reserved for winter.\n\u201cAre you hard of hearing, you ox? Get away from here!\u201d said Carles, and stooping to pick up a pebble, lobbed it at me.\nIt struck my knuckle, but I scarcely felt it. I was thinking about something else as I backed away: the oddness of the putrid smell that forced hands and handkerchiefs to faces \u2014 that it didn\u2019t smell like the death poor Rafael had been dealt. His body was fresh, the blood still dripping; the flies that overran this part of the world had not yet discovered his corpse.\nAnd as I took a final good look at Rafael in death, I saw something that rattled my bones. On the underside of his left arm, tucked under his body \u2014 the only part of his corpse both unscathed and stripped bare of clothing\u2014three pustules bulged, the skin above them taut, livid, cracked, each the size of a thumb.\nA fourth had cracked open outright. From the burst, ragged skin seeped mucus. It had trickled into the sun and cooked upon the sun-warmed ground. No one else seemed to see these small wounds in the shadows while Rafael\u2019s fatal wounds shone in the light, but the residue leaking onto the stony ground was impossible to mistake.\nThe stench wasn\u2019t like eggs \u2014 it was eggs. Growing under Rafael\u2019s skin.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhen Rafael\u2019s infested corpse flashed like an afterimage of the sun behind my eyes, memories of Casia and Aleja followed. Not the sweet memories, but the world-ending ones, of Casia\u2019s limp body wrapped in a dirty tarp, thin and yellowed, bloody tear tracks marring her round cheeks. Little Aleja holding my hand tight as masked men, trailing incense, lay her sister onto a pile of the dead, our Casia so much smaller than the others, her little feet hanging free, nubs of toes still perfect even in death. And the shivers of fever already wracking Aleja\u2019s small limbs as the horses trotted out, carting my firstborn off to a common grave.\n\u201cDarra!\u201d came the child\u2019s insistent shout through the door. I opened it to find the little urchin on foot, overflowing with more wares than ever, weighed down like an orange tree before harvest. The coffee pot was strapped across her back in addition to her usual encumberments, and the broken front wheel of her tricycle dangled from the crook of her elbow, sharing this mooring point with the usual water bladder. Kohled eyes shone up at me. Spittle streaked a quivering upper lip. She looked miserable.\n\u201cWhat happened? Where\u2019s your tricycle?\u201d I asked, making pedaling motions with my palms.\nWhen my meaning dawned on her, the little urchin\u2019s face contorted tearily, until she no longer seemed older than her handful of years. In that earthy voice she began to babble some explanation. I could hardly tell her sobs apart from the words of the native language, but I knew well how to comfort a small child.\nI gently helped her spread out the goods she carried on the bed, and brought out my box of buttons to soothe her. But the small peddler was inconsolable, and once her arms were free I saw the recent marks of a stick or a cane welted across her skin, shoulder to elbow.\nI held up the detached tricycle wheel, suddenly fearing for us both. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked again, pointing at the wheel.\nThis time Nur dropped to silence, then, resolving something, motioned for me to follow behind. I went along, chasing tiny plum-colored socks stuffed into threadbare sequined slippers back into the maze of the lazaretto.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAnd then we were in Nur\u2019s own place; blankets heaped in the dust, the untouched second pair of socks, and a red felt tarboosh, a furrowed slash through it as though it had been caught on something jagged. In the corner, beside a pillow so thin it could have been a handkerchief, was a heavy-looking tobacco pipe I guessed was stolen, and a pile of marbles on top of a nest of cloth.\nNur poked her nose behind the nearest stack of crates and withdrew two oriental swords.\nThe rust-speckled blades were slender, curving towards the little urchin as she held them one in each hand. They were too small and easily wielded to be anything but a plaything, but she held one out to me, repeating her refrain of \u201cDarra! Darra!\u201d in her too-deep voice, and then eastern words flew out of her like loose stones tumbling down the side of a Lebanese mountain.\nThe sword was the first one I had ever held. When Nur put it in my hand, I thought of the weight of my only bronze stockpot hoisted down from a rafter, how Casia would help me fill it from the well and walk it carefully back to the kitchen. She would watch me boil the lentils we had spent the morning clearing of stones and dust and mildew. We added meat spices at the end, to pretend we were eating that morning\u2019s catch of shellfish, fresh bread, a ragout of spiced sausage. A dish of eggs and peppers, golden yolks running to the edges of the bowl.\nI thought of dead Rafael, seeping secretly in the courtyard.\nThe little urchin did not test her own sword like a playful youngster might. She held it solemnly, her purpose too deep and heavy to sparkle in those long-lashed eyes. The recent welts on her arm had begun to bruise purple. With her free hand she took mine and tugged me towards the door. I steadied my nerves with one extended breath.\nWe went.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI had a better clue: the muffled sounds of clipped Spanish through the door. \u201cBring him over, Vasco\u2026\u201d, \u201cHere, here.\u201d Accustomed to hearing words through closed doors, or flung over a shoulder on the wind, I noted the tension in the captain\u2019s voice. It inflamed my dread. Nur had quieted down, her urchin\u2019s fingers spidering to hook the metal ring hanging from the sculpted door knob, her feet in socks and slippers bracing to pull the door open.\nI put my empty hand over Nur\u2019s on the metal warmed by the humidity and heat of the late afternoon, and stepped between her and the door. I was clenching my jaw, the chewing teeth I still had aching, the gummy voids in between throbbing with pressure. When I pulled at the door it gave smoothly, no latch to hold it fast.\nA burning bonfire where the bed should have been threw jittering shadows on the walls, and cast angular light on a handful of sailors.\nThere was a moment of complete calm as the door swung open, while eyes adjusted theirs to the sun behind us, ours to the fire and smoke. That awful smell hung, cloying, even with the thick woodsmoke coughing out through the seaside window. Then shouting cascaded, Nur angry and guttural behind me, the sailors indignant, concerned, outraged.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the fucking seamstress, captain,\u201d said Carles.\n\u201cShit,\u201d said Vasco.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here, you? Have you no scrap of instinct for when to keep to yourself?\u201d The captain sounded incensed, angrier than I had ever heard him, angrier than he ever was when gales battered the Tridente and the crew grew tired of jumping to his commands. But the anger masked a hoarseness of voice, a struggle for breath.\n\u201cWho will explain what happened to Rafael?\u201d I asked, directing my question at the captain. \u201cAnd this child was caned by our crew. Is that how vicious we\u2019ve become?\u201d\nI stroked Nur\u2019s hair. It was thick and knotted as a broom bush. At my touch her mighty voice burst anew; she shouted and gestured at the fire, craning up at me. It took me too long to recognize what should have been obvious, but even my wilted mind could not mistake the wooden horse gnawed by fire, the ornate curved lengths of metal being heated to a red glow by Vasco and Carles.\n\u201cYou made kindling of her tricycle!\u201d I was devastated, heartbroken, and I could not say why.\n\u201cTricycle! Rafael! A half-grown savage at your heels! Darra, you know nothing! Nothing!\u201d the captain roared. \u201cYou want to know? Is that right?\u201d He strode to Morizio, who was slumped against the wall at the opposite side of the bonfire. \u201cLook at this man!\u201d The captain grabbed him by the tunic, yanking it roughly upwards as Morizio writhed. The sailor struggled to free himself of the shirt as though it were doused in acid, his agonized shrieks cutting the thick, diseased atmosphere.\n\u201cLook what afflicts us, by God!\u201d\nThe shirt came loose and I saw.\nTens of bulbous, festering pustules, each taut and egg-shaped. No, not all egg-shaped, for some had been crushed by the captain\u2019s cruel undressing. They oozed yolk and pus and blood down into the cleft of Morizio\u2019s bellybutton. Dotted among the pustules were shiny wounds like wax seals, angry and puckered. Wounds made by a cautery rod, like the fire-heated metal frame of a tricycle. By desperate men.\nI dropped my toy sword, overwhelmed.\nI had mopped up black vomit from the smooth hollow of Aleja\u2019s chest, her skin yellow as a maize field, her inhalations too weak to replenish her lungs. I had already lost my elder girl then. I remembered rubbing my eyes with the backs of my hands; I had wanted to catch it, to go with my daughters to wherever innocent girls were allowed to laugh and play forever. When I realized I could not follow, joining the Tridente\u2019s crew \u2014 living in my own Hell \u2014 had seemed easier than continuing our life without them.\nMorizio coughed past a web of phlegm in his throat, and I was filled with sudden revulsion. I did not want to die like this. I was not one of these men, with their vices and their hard hands and their loveless lives.\n\u201cFuck her and that little monkey that follows her around,\u201d said Carles, turning away, towards Morizio. \u201cWe have bigger problems, captain. Hold him down, will you, Vasco?\u201d\nVasco held Morizio. Carles readied the red hot poker. I tugged Nur towards the door.\n\u201cCome, little one.\u201d It was not too late to save her from this wretched room, its infectious fumes. Morizio screamed and thrashed as the sizzling poker met one of its marks. I tugged on Nur\u2019s hand again.\nThe urchin broke suddenly free and ran at the fire. She began swatting the burning horse with her sword, nudging it out of the flames. Resolve set her face, her big eyes reflecting twin bonfires.\n\u201cGet away from there, you! Psst!\u201d said Vasco, turning to give Nur a small kick to the hip. She tumbled sideways, then regained her feet, and went back to rescuing the figurehead of her beloved tricycle.\n\u201cWhy play so nice with a savage half-sex whore\u2019s get?\u201d said Carles. \u201cAt home we\u2019d tie it to a post in the garden to make a living scarecrow, right Darra?\u201d And he lifted the glowing poker he\u2019d held to Morizio\u2019s pustules and sent it arcing towards Nur\u2019s bare shoulders.\nAnd my body erupted with a searing, silver pain as wide and borderless as the ocean. I must have run forward, for the poker landed along my arm and collarbone and neck, a line of fire. I had been hit by a bolt of lightning, doused by an up-ended volcano. I wished the person who was screaming so frightfully, so deafeningly, would stop, though part of me knew that the voice was my own. To escape the odor of cooking flesh I buried my face beneath my armpit, and a tiny body shouted \u201cDarra!\u201d against my skirts.\n\u201cOh well, Darra,\u201d Carles\u2019 voice taunted, far, far away. \u201cYou\u2019d probably caught the eggs off one of us already, we\u2019ve all used you enough times.\u201d\nI remember a rectangle of light widening as the door opened onto the dusty alleys of the lazaretto, then a netting of humidity descending on me as I ran half-conscious, ears roaring, behind the scampering child.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI remember Nur arranging a Syrian veiled garment on me. I remember feeling icy shivers radiating from my innermost parts outwards, and how I gathered the mildew smelling robe tighter for warmth, though the air was drenched with humidity.\nNur guided me while I became almost senseless with the throbbing of my wound. I had visions of a Syrian mountain beast sinking its enormous jaws into my collarbone then shaking me to free a bite of rancid flesh. While these waking nightmares filled my thoughts, Nur dragged me by the hand, first concealing us in the shaded alleys of the lazaretto, then leading me to the entrance of the quarantine compound by way of the shadows of the lodgings along the lazaretto\u2019s coast.\nAt the entrance, we encountered the stone-faced, tarbooshed Turkish guard who had chaperoned the Tridente\u2019s crew into the lazaretto weeks ago. Nur wrapped a spindly arm around my hip and spoke to the guard for long minutes while I peered out from within my Syrian robes. I realized then why Nur had earlier removed my canvas espadrilles, unknown to these shores. Could I pass for the child\u2019s relative? A supplier of coffee, a confectioner of boiled sweets?\nThe guard twirled his waxed moustache as he interrogated the little urchin. I willed him to look away from my uncovered eyes and the dark secrets etched so clearly upon them.\nSuddenly the guard\u2019s rolling thumb and forefinger stilled and he locked hooded eyes on mine. I cannot say with certainty, but it seemed that he had found me out, for recognition washed his features. But in the next moment he swung wide the gate of the lazaretto, granting Nur and I leave to enter the city of Beyrouth. Whether it was pity or trust that moved him, I did not know.\nThe city opened to us willingly. Two new furtive faces were nothing amidst the bustle we found in the central square. The smells of spice, sweat, and tobacco layered on the cacophony of colors to unsettle me and churn my stomach. Turbans, billowing slacks, tarbooshes, curl-toed sandals, robes, and conical hats trailing gauze adorned the dark-featured Syrians and Turks. The evening crowds of Beyrouth swept past. Some led donkeys or haggled in the night market. I let myself be moved along until I no longer saw Carles\u2019 vicious face pursuing me in the night. Then I broke free of our flight from the lazaretto to sink down in a quiet corner behind the street face of a mosque.\nThe little seller retreated a while, but returned to me carrying a bowl of water and a rag. \u201cDarra!\u201d she repeated to alert me as she bathed my burns. Had I the strength I would have sent her away from the contagion rooting itself in my skin, but I was wracked with a deep chill once again, too weak to resist.\nInstead I allowed myself to walk the streets of Malaga hand in hand with my Casia and Aleja. Each time the scents of Beyrouth intruded I covered my nose more tightly with my musky veil. And when the horrors of what might have infested my body threatened to unravel my mind, I looked upon my clever-eyed little seller surrounded by her untamed city and put my back to the wall inside me, stalwart and straight.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue27\/3lbe27_story3.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"Before we set sail for Beyrouth, I had resolved to knit ten pairs of socks, one for each day of the journey.

The drought had been hard and the plague had taken the better part of the village, leaving little and fewer to tend to the crops.\nThe last of them had left long ago after burning their dead; the smell was still fresh in my nostrils. They had left in the early hours of the morning, just as the sun still crept over the hills, quietly so I wouldn\u2019t hear them go. I heard them, anyhow. The flicking of the animals\u2019 tails against the onslaught of flies, the hushed whispers as families and belongings alike were piled atop the bullock cart, the final complaining screech and creak of the wheels as they departed.\nAnd I was alone.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBut a week or so later, the winds cleared and I smelled him at last, as clear as the day he had first left home, barely a boy. Now he seemed more a man, taller, wearier, as he rode his horse down the low sweeping paths leading him home.\nTo say I was delighted would be an understatement. My unoon had never burned brighter, merrily lighting up my kitchen in gold and red as I cooked: moong dal and puffy luchis, tender mutton from the goats left to wander the remnants of the mustard fields. As I heard his horse approach, I called out in delight, \u201cYou\u2019ve come!\u201d\nThere was silence and his voice returned from the outside, as warm as ever, \u201cI\u2019m home, Dida. Is there anything to eat? I\u2019m starving.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a question! Of course there is, my grandson has come home and he thinks he will not be fed. Sit, sit and I will bring you all that I have been preparing.\u201d\nI heard the sound of footsteps at my doorway and then his horse neighed from outside. My grandson stopped and I called out to him, \u201cThere is fresh grass on the other side \u2014 take it there. Leave it to graze! Horses must also eat.\u201d\nMy grandson laughed \u2014 how dear his laugh was \u2014 and I heard him take his animal away. I set about preparing; on the floor, I laid bowls of steaming dal, just on the right side of savory, along with bite-sized chunks of potatoes swimming in gravy, crispy begunis, aloo posto, fragrant and soft, straight out of the kitchen, and a generous helping of mouth-watering mutton. Rice was heaped on his plate along with several freshly made luchis. As I was grinding the flour, I heard him come back inside and he let out a sigh as he caught sight of the food. I heard a clatter as he dropped his belongings and sat down on the floor to gorge.\n\u201cAre you happy?\u201d I couldn\u2019t stop myself from asking. \u201cMy poor sweet boy, is this enough? If you\u2019re hungry, don\u2019t hold yourself back. Tell me what you want to eat.\u201d\n\u201cDida, this is wonderful.\u201d I didn\u2019t see him, but I could hear him grinning from ear to ear. \u201cYou know what would make this perfect? If there was a mango \u2014 you have no idea how much I\u2019ve thought about having one. I thought about having one all the way here, Dida! A whole mango, all to myself.\u201d\n\u201cBut of course!\u201d I was giddy with delight. The mango tree in my backyard \u2014 my great secret \u2014 had sprouted perfect yellow and plump mangoes just a day or so ago. \u201cYou will have all the mangoes you want!\u201d\nFrom my kitchen, I stretched my arm for his mango. My arm stretched past him, past my front door, all the way to my mango tree. I heard the horse shriek with alarm \u2014 wretched creature, I had forgotten it was there \u2014 as I plucked the fruit.\nThere was a dead silence outside my kitchen. I could no longer hear my grandson chewing.\nI brought the fruit back inside and deposited it on his plate. I then pulled my hand back to my kitchen and returned to grinding the flour.\nAfter a moment, there was a soft and hesitant voice from outside, \u201c...Dida?\u201d\n\u201cYes, darling?\u201d\n\u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d\n\u201cOh, there was a sickness. Many people died. Those who didn\u2019t, left.\u201d The flour was fine below my long, callused fingers as I set to making a fresh batch of luchis. \u201cThey said many people in the cities have died. I thought you would know.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d A moment of silence. \u201cMa\u2026 and Baba?\u201d\n\u201cEven them.\u201d If I rolled the luchis a bit harder than usual and threw them into the oil a little more aggressively, nobody was here to see it.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s just you here, Dida?\u201d\n\u201cYes, darling.\u201d\nI could see him then, in my mind\u2019s eye \u2014 as young as the day I had lost him. He had always been a quiet child. A battle had been the wrong place to send him.\nI finished making the luchis and picked them up, the oil burning through my skin but barely hurting me. I extended my arm and watched as it stretched through my kitchen entrance to reach him and put the luchis on his plate.\nIn the silence that followed, he began to sob.\nWithout seeing him, without looking at him, my hand touched his face and felt the tears on it. Sitting in my kitchen, I stroked his face until I found the single bullet hole, and covered it tenderly with my thumb.\n\u201cHush now,\u201d I said from my kitchen, vast and majestic. I pulled my feet out from under my unoon and finally stood, the room crowding me and forcing me to hunch. I made my way to the front room and with my other arm, gathered up my poor lost boy, home at last, as he wept openly in my arms.\nCarrying him, I ducked through my doorway and listened to the wild anxiety of my grandson\u2019s horse. With a snapping sound, the animal broke free and I watched it hurl itself through our mustard fields. Soon, it was a tiny spot in the distant horizon and then gone all together.\nMy grandson clung to me and I held him as only I knew how to. I held him as I had yearned to hold him when he lay in the mud all those years ago, in a war that was not his.

The knowledge that swirls freely here, so rich in this thin air\u2014it makes my head spin. In the lands below, we never get more than a sip of the pure stuff, a quick breath at a time, drifting upward in the wake of a wandering scholar\u2026.\nI had always dreamed of climbing to the Libraerie. When I was little, I imagined myself a hero, one who would bring back learning to my family, to our home. When I became a man, that dream faded but didn\u2019t evaporate. Leela used to tease me about it, until it became a joke between us, a way of framing the future in impractical and vague optimism\u2014but that was before the hard times, the years of long winters and bad summers, the shortages and the rumors of war. (Don\u2019t forget that things were bad even before the curse of calcification.) That was when I began to take my old dream seriously.\nI talked to our neighbors and the townsfolk, asked them why we couldn\u2019t demand help from the Libraerie\u2014surely among the wealth of gathered knowledge, there must be answers, solutions that could help us. Why else did scholars travel through the world, observing and studying?\nI earned many odd looks. \u201cWhat a question\u201d and, \u201cThat\u2019s not their role\u201d and, \u201cThat\u2019s like asking a smith to give his newly made sword to a lump of iron.\u201d\nI kept arguing. The harvest failed after the second year. Then the town stores dwindled to nothing, and the wealthy merchants and factors tightened their belts, and others began to echo my words. \u201cWhy do we welcome the scholars into our lands, and wish them well on their way, bearing the fruit of their studies? Why does knowledge, once distilled by a scholar\u2019s pen, rise up and seemingly away from us, seeking always the highest points? Why do we let it?\u201d\nThe magister and his council began to make demands. They sent messages to the far-off Imperial government, and spoke in person to those scholars who still visited. They even paid for a messenger to take passage on a scholarly airship and petition the Abbot Libraerian here directly. Did you know that? We waited, and word spread that help might come.\nBefore any did, though, the calcifications began.\nWomen gravid with child were pulled down by the weight of what they carried, at first hardly able to walk, and then unable to rise from bed. The first births were hushed up, or any reports of them were dismissed as rumor and fearmongering. I admit it, Leela and I doubted the stories\u2014how could such a thing be true? But then the magister\u2019s wife died of calcified birth, and her funeral procession passed through town, the magister walking last and clutching what would have been his child. Everyone had to believe after that.\nWe thought, now surely help would come. No one has seen anything like this before. The Emperor would send doctors to root out the malaise. The scholars would want to investigate, to find a cure.\nTime passed, and Imperial soldiers closed the roads. They cut off our province like a gangrenous limb, lest it poison the entire body. We were isolated and afraid, and when a party of scholars like yourself came at last, we greeted them as our saviors. Leela was the one to return from town the day their airship landed, and she told me how the magister wept to see them, and the crowd pushed forward and cried out in supplication, all trying to tell their stories of fear and pain.\nYour brothers and sisters listened. They walked the streets, tasted our water and smelled our earth. They pulled hoods across their faces before visiting the afflicted women in their beds\u2014those that had them\u2014and before examining the bodies of those that had come to term. They even weighed the calcifications, taking careful notes all the while.\nThey were not heartless. They offered suggestions, palliatives, and expressed concern. Their leader told the magister and the assembled council that he wished he could do more--but they must apply reason and inspiration to the germs of understanding they had gathered, before they could produce anything to explain what was occurring here, let alone discover a cure. They needed to refine their observations of what we were living through into knowledge, and that knowledge would take them up and away, as it became purer and more true.\nLeela and I were in the crowd when their airship departed, its balloon lifted and filled by the wisdom of the texts the scholars carried with them, the learning they had gathered from the lowlands and the products of their own studies. The airship\u2019s vanes creaked and spread great sails to direct its flight, and the people who stood in its shadow murmured to each other.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll come back,\u201d some said, \u201cThey\u2019ll find a cure and return.\u201d But others scoffed, and some cursed the scholars and their precious, lighter-than-air knowledge. Their mood was dark, and fear turned easily to anger.\n\u201cWe could go to them!\u201d I argued, \u201cIf they don\u2019t return, we should climb to their high perch and demand answers from the Libraerie itself.\u201d\nThe people nearest to me laughed\u2014a tearing, painful noise to cover desperation. \u201cFool!\u201d they called me, \u201cNo one can climb to the Libraerie. Their own airships can barely rise above the lower peaks to reach it.\u201d\n\u201cBut think!\u201d I insisted, \u201cWe\u2019ve only their word that it\u2019s impossible. They let knowledge seek its highest level\u2014what if there is already knowledge of a cure there?\u201d\nThey shook their heads, and when I told them I would seek out the council, present my ideas to the magister, their anger turned on me.\n\u201cYou see the scholars left us!\u201d my nearest neighbor said, \u201cThere is no hope for solutions we can never reach. Only we can take care of ourselves.\u201d\nLeela had her hand on my arm, and her voice in my ear told me to listen and take care. I let her pull me away, and we followed the rutted road back to our farm.\nWe avoided the town soon after that. Shortages abounded even before winter brought the worst of its barren cold. \u201cLook to your own households,\u201d people said, but desperation turned them against each other, and against authority. A merchant\u2019s storehouse burned when he tried to hoard it from hungry townsfolk. Some turned sickened women out into the street, for fear that the calcification would spread to others.\nI was ready to make good on my suggestion, despite the season, but Leela came to me in the dusk of a late-fall evening as I fashioned a pair of fleece-lined gloves, such as I\u2019d heard travelers to the far north made use of. She placed my hands on her stomach, and told her news. She said that she had no fear, only great hope and love for me and the child to come.\nI tried to hope as well, and I turned my mind from leaving. When the Emperor sent a caravan of food supplies to sustain us through the winter, we told each other that fortune had changed for our province. I persuaded Leela to stay home while I went to collect our portion. She never knew that I traded on credit to supplement our rations with overpriced milk and butter.\nAll winter I kept the fire in our hearth built high, and listened to Leela tell stories of our future, determined to believe, to hold tighter to the dream of new life and happiness than I\u2019d ever cherished my fantasy of the Libraerie. I never had the heart to question her optimism, even when she grew so heavy with her swollen belly, and could only lie by the hearth with her eyes turned towards the flames.\nThe winter dwindled at last, and the days warmed, but the cold seemed to embed itself in Leela\u2019s bones. She felt it more and more as her time grew closer. I sweltered as I built the fire higher and higher, and still she wrapped blankets tight and shivered.\nI would place my hands on her cheeks and find them icy, even as sweat ran into my eyes and stuck my shirt to my back. It\u2019s hard to imagine now, what it felt like to suffer from that heat. This aching cold is what she must have felt close to the end.\nTo the last, she spoke of our child and how she would love it. The words might as well have laid a spell on me, for I could only look at her and nod, holding back fear and blinding myself to all the signs.\nOne night she woke me without meaning to. We both slept fitfully, her from the growing pain and chill, me from alertness to her needs. I remember the sound of her breathing, harsh over the crackling of the fire, and the way it caught when the labor came.\nI watched her struggle, through pain and fear, to a place beyond words, just cries of agony as her body destroyed her. She was strong, and that strength tore her apart. Many women failed to deliver calcified results, but she forced it out at last, with a great rending and a welter of blood that spread and stained the floor of our home. She gasped and shuddered, but didn\u2019t speak again, and I was left holding her shell.\nI looked at the thing that could have been my child. I reached out, half hoping that some miracle had occurred, that Leela\u2019s death was a common tragedy of birth\u2014but when I laid my fingers against its small skull, I found a smooth and hard surface, colder and deader than any flesh.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI turned from everything that had burned. I set out with a single cold burden, without supplies or plans or even a full understanding of what I was attempting.\nI was a long time climbing--first past the foothills and the forested slopes above them. I stumbled into a village in a high valley, where a family took pity on me, filthy and worn as I was. I made no mention of the thing I carried in my pack. They didn\u2019t ask where I was from, though they might have guessed, since they kept me at arms\u2019 length and didn\u2019t invite me into the house. Instead, they let me sleep in the hayloft above their goats, who were hardier and more sure-footed than those of the lowlands.\nI told them my destination, and they told me I was mad; I would die of exposure, if my heart didn\u2019t burst under the strain of breathing. Even people who lived at the knees of the mountains struggled to adjust to the conditions above them\u2014only scholars with treatises to their names could breathe easily above the point where the air grew scare and pure knowledge floated freely.\nI told them it didn\u2019t matter what anyone said, I was determined to try, and the family matriarch, a woman who directed her children, grandchildren, and goats with equal vigor and authority, only shook her head. \u201cYou aren\u2019t the first fool to come this way,\u201d she said, \u201cnor yet the first who refuses to abandon your path--but we have yet to see one come back down the mountains.\nI lowered my head and said nothing, and after a while she sighed and said, \u201cAt least be a well-prepared fool. Give us a few days of labor in exchange for some proper garb. The year retreats back into winter the higher you climb.\u201d\nI took her generosity and was glad of it. When I finally set off again, I thought the intervening days of work (laying stones to repair a wall and digging expansions to their terraced fields) had helped me grow used to the thin air, and I now had a hooded coat, boots, and gloves of the sort that I had struggled to create before, when the idea of this journey was built on hope rather than suffering. They also gave me a bedroll woven from the husks of firemoths, which would hold the heat of the day through the night\u2019s darkness, spikes to clamp to my boots when I reached the glacier, and an ice axe to haul myself up with. It was generosity I didn\u2019t deserve.\nMy host was right, though. I was still a fool and ill prepared. I climbed above the forest, through terrain marked by brush and single, twisted trees, among hard faces of rock and treacherous scree. I learned to go carefully, sometimes crouched on my hands and feet. I tried to ration the food the villagers had given me, and that became easier as my stomach turned and my head grew light.\nEvery once in a while, a shadow fell over me, and I would look up to see the shape of an airship pass over, sails belled by wind. I reached out\u2014and I couldn\u2019t tell myself if my gesture was a threat or a plea.\nI aligned my path by the airships in the sky, and I reached a place where snow lingered in the shadows beneath rock overhangs and where my breath encrusted my eyes and mouth at night when I tried to sleep. The stones I clambered over gave way to groaning ice\u2014blue-white and irregular, riven with crevasses. Some were massive gashes in the terrain, which I skirted for hours before I could find a way to ascend. Others were hidden beneath crusted snow and promised death for an unwary step.\nI discovered this when the ground gave way beneath me and I dropped into a narrow chasm. I was lucky that it was so narrow, a tapering wedge in which I stuck fast after only a short sickening jolt of a fall, and luckier still that my pick was in my hands as I dropped. Those moments that I scrabbled, pinned between the suffocating walls of ice, could have been an eternity for all I knew, but when I eventually found purchase and clawed myself free and back up into the light, the sun had hardly moved and the world was unchanged. I could have slipped that quickly and easily into death, and no one would have ever found me.\nAfter that I advanced more carefully, testing the space ahead with my pick as I went. My boots and heavy leggings had protected me from laceration within the crevasse, but my feet and legs were deeply bruised. My pace slowed, and I fought off a rising fear that I would never reach my destination.\nI spent my last night in my bedroll curled around my bundled burden, in a hollowed-out ledge beneath one of the great standing shards of ice\u2014but sleep wouldn\u2019t come. I drifted above dreams haunted by flames and the sound of Leela\u2019s screams, and jerked alert again and again with a feeling that I was choking, that the air I sucked into my lungs was full of ash. At first light, I emptied the remaining stores from my pack and continued on, carrying only my pick, and my burden.\nI finally climbed above the jagged canyons of groaning ice, and saw, still far above me, the black walls of the Libraerie. It rose from a ridge just below the highest reaches of the mountains, as forbidding as the peaks themselves, blank-faced and shuttered against the cold and wind. That wind accelerated around me, skimming packed snow off the ground in streams of icicle mist and drawing clouds through the sky above and below. The weather had favored me with clear skies and wind gusts that burned my skin but didn\u2019t send me to my knees\u2014until now. I was a fool, completely unprepared for the coming storm.\nI tightened the strip of cloth I wore around my eyes to protect from the snow\u2019s reflective glare, put my head down, and pushed upward. Now I was beyond the worst of the crevasses, but I came to an expanse of mountain so steep I had to claw my way up by finger holds for stride-lengths at a time. The weight I carried bore me down. My heart raced and thundered at the exertion, and my muscles burned and shook. I had to rest often, feel the cold more deeply each time, trying to massage life back into my hands and feet.\nAt last I pulled myself over a lip of stone and lay delirious for a long, long while before I could find the strength to stand again. By the time I did, daylight had faded to an early gray dusk. The wind was overpowering, and I could barely see two steps ahead. My hands had stiffened like wood within their gloves, even as I pressed my fingers into my armpits to try and revive them. I had no chance of making it up another stretch of climbing, and could only hope that the angle of the slope I was currently following would lead me to the foot of the Libraerie.\nMy memories blur beyond this point. I must have stumbled, or maybe crawled, onward and upward. I remember struggling against fear\u2014but somehow Leela was with me again, sometimes urging me on, sometimes smiling slyly in the way she always used to when I took myself too seriously. The world grew darker and darker, and I wanted to collapse, to rest, but I knew there was something I desperately needed to do, even if I couldn\u2019t think what that was.\nI don\u2019t remember your people finding me, or how I came into this place. The end of my journey is only darkness and cold in my mind\u2014and then the flames returned, and they were burning my fingers, and I couldn\u2019t snatch my hands away....\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe rule of scholars may be \u201cthe greater the truth, the higher and closer to heaven,\u201d but I\u2019ve come\u2014climbed beyond pain and despair and my own abilities\u2014to plead that you bring your knowledge down to where it's needed in the lowlands. Look at what I\u2019ve brought you, what horrors we have suffered. You must understand. You must do something. Why else would I have carried this monstrosity with me for so long?\nYour fellows claimed they had no answers when they visited us, but time has passed\u2014surely you\u2019ve learned, refined\u2014discovered\u2014whatever you do to turn your notes and observations of the world into true understanding. There must be answers here, among all the works that have risen to this height. Please bring some down to my people. It\u2019s too late for Leela, but it\u2019s not too late for others.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nNaturally, the supplicant could not understand such laws, even if the inner mysteries of scholarship permitted us to explain them. He spoke no more, once our decision was made clear to him, except to refuse requests for further interviews or invitations to stay safe within the Libraerie. As soon as he was able, he insisted on attempting a return journey, despite all arguments to the contrary, his ravaged state, and his injuries from exposure. We hold little hope for his success or survival.\nAt least this narrative remains within the Libraerie, alongside the remnant carried by the supplicant. It is a remarkable artifact, identical in every detail to newborn infant, save that it is cast in stone. We note the astonishing good fortune, for our studies, that the supplicant was able to bring it all this way.\nIt is hoped that these materials will provide a valuable source for the future development of knowledge about the calcificatory plague, the social customs of the lowlands, or the superhuman capacities of the desperate.]","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue34\/3lbe34_story4.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"[Scholar's note: the following is taken from interviews held between the 15th and 18th days of the Month of Swallows, in the 1115th year since the Libraerie's founding.

I have accepted the sentence for disinterring my husband and borrowing equipment without permission. I know I shall not return to my university post. But the astonishment you express, gentlemen, is entirely undeserved. I assure you I had every wit about me when I embarked on this project.\nConsider the life cycle of Turritopsis dohrnii. Popular science has nicknamed this cnidarian \u201cthe immortal jellyfish.\u201d They are born as larvae, which take root as polyps, which spawn free-swimming medusae. And if they are injured, or subject to infection, these jellyfish do not send for a notary; they do not expire with a last rancid breath against white hospital sheets. They simply revert back to the polyp stage.\nImagine! Your body gone all Picasso after a bus crash, femurs pointing out of your legs toward the ceiling, and you sigh and say, \u201cI suppose it\u2019s time,\u201d before compressing yourself into a fetus!\nI did not anticipate that Gavin would transdifferentiate his cells in this manner, no. That would be absurd. I suspect, gentlemen, that you are missing the point.\nA more familiar example, then: the lobster. These creatures are negligibly senescent \u2014 that is, they do not appear to age. They remain fertile and virile all their lives, and they never stop growing. In fact, they perish only when caught for human consumption, or when the act of molting their shells becomes too taxing. Or, yes, when they are diseased.\nGavin had no exoskeleton, and the more\u2019s the pity, for he was a sunken mess when I retrieved him. As a species, we are quite structurally unsound, and death underlines this fact in red ink after just a few days in the casket.\nI should hope you understand how hard it was for me, seeing him as a battered, stinking marionette. No wife ever hopes to watch her husband\u2019s head loll back until the Adam\u2019s apple splits the skin of his neck. No loving wife, I should clarify.\nBut here, again, the ocean\u2019s most persistent fauna needn\u2019t worry. Have you seen the hydra? Small underwater animals, resembling tentacled plants. Each time they eat, they must tear open a wound between their fronds. Each new mouth, a ripped-apart hole. Would any of you have the fortitude, when presented with your favorite dish? Mine is coq au vin, and I promise you, if Gavin could cook it for me again, I would gladly take a knife to my flesh and make a prettily bleeding door.\nThe hydra, they can seal their mouths back up, quick-as-you-please. They see no sense in leaving themselves agape.\nI tried to do as much after he died. I thought I might interlock my cells until they were airtight, so as not to admit the miasma of grief. But it spiraled up from inside me, grew like strangling kelp from my stomach to my throat, kept my face damp and my breathing quick.\nI had no help, so I had to carry him home alone, terrified that he would come apart at the waist, he felt so loose. But then I thought it might be a good thing, this new slackness he had, because isn\u2019t that how sea creatures feel? Like they might slide out of your hands, like they flow on their own.\nI took him to the cellar, sat him in my makeshift laboratory full of tanks and thirsty pipettes.\nDid you know there are clams that can live to be more than 500 years old? Clams that, had they been perched on a groundling\u2019s cap, could recite memories of Shakespeare premieres. Clams that are just as alive as you or I, only their innards do not mount an attack on themselves, growing masses that glob onto vital things.\nAnd I thought, maybe it\u2019s the medium in which they live. Could their DNA have been strengthened, in the saltwater, through some hidden osmosis I hadn\u2019t yet observed? If I exposed him to the sea, to the cells of its undying citizens, could he bud a polyp colony of his own?\nIt is not so foolish a notion when you\u2019ve seen what\u2019s already siphoning through the water: chains of transparent salps, like the necklaces of fragile gods; squid that flash moving faces across their skins. A cancer copies and copies and copies, breeding defects. But those in the sea, they make no errors. No edits. They birth themselves whole and glistening.\nSo, I had to try.\nI cut him open to dig out the tumors I could find. I harvested unblemished tissue. I kissed him, flayed as he was, and promised to love whatever form he took.\nIt is tiresome work, gentlemen, injecting medusae. Hard to find their nigh-transparent borders under a microscope, harder still to pierce them and leave them with your lover\u2019s nucleotides. But the process kills two birds, you see: once injected, the medusae think themselves injured, and drift to the bottom of the tank. Tethered to the substrate, they transform into their younger selves, those sprouting polyps \u2014 my incubators.\nI thought I had failed when the polyps did not produce new jellyfish for several days. Gavin\u2019s leaking corpse became a mockery of my effort, and I half-expected it to start demanding answers from me, his voice pouring from its ruined torso. Perhaps he would ask the teasing questions he often posed while I was researching: What\u2019s your favorite nudibranch? How smart is a brain coral? Do you think humans should reproduce like seahorses, with the father bearing the young? Will you miss me, when I\u2019m gone? Will you find another? What color would you want his hair to be?\nBut on the eighth day, the medusae were there.\nI don\u2019t need to tell you how spectacular they were. You saw them when you confiscated the tank \u2014 a task, I recall, that took six of your lackeys. By then they had grown splendidly. The one with Gavin\u2019s eyes had taken to surfacing and looking about, and the one with fingers had learned to grip my hand, to squeeze, to pluck a whole shrimp from my grasp and pass it up into itself. You didn\u2019t get to see the third: a pinwheel of human teeth arrayed just above a mass of tentacles. It had begun to attack the other two, and so I punctured its bell with a pen. Its polyps were almost mature again when you discovered us.\nI only ask, gentlemen, that you release them into the ocean. It will be satisfactory for me to know that Gavin shall never fully exit this world. He may regress, and be reborn, but he won\u2019t be absent. Why should anyone be snuffed out, when the sea promises such a legacy?\nPlease. Ferry them out to open waters, away from the nets and the gulls. However perverse you find my devotion, let it live.\nAnd live.\nAnd live.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue28\/3lbe28_story4.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"The sea is rife with immortals and healers.

Totemic cannibals. Blood drinkers. Head hunters. They serve him. They serve the bastard god and do not even know it. Him. He who sucks love and laughter and light and warmth and all things good and human. He the withered dead bush demigod of black satin nightmares and dayscreams. He who bathes in the virginal menstrual blood of a world vacuumed free of emotion. She knows him very well. His tears are wine and his breath sugar. She can see him in her mind and he knows he\u2019s being seen.\nOctober. Trees explode with Autumnal fires of pumpkin orange and fire red.\nA sight to behold. It ignites the imagination. Colors. Sensations. Souls on fire. September is gone. Summer is a warm memory, a magical season of extinction. Hot kisses, humid nights, smoldering beach sands baked like glass, sultry evenings spent with cool drinks. Autumn is here. And has been for years.\n\u201cNoctulos,\u201d Freda says and wants to vomit. \u201cThief of the real. He has even stolen the seasons.\u201d\nHe is all midnight and black cells. Insatiable, gnawing desires that are all sterile and stillborn. Housed in a moldering tunic of hideous, petrified flesh with a leering depraved puppet face of plaster rot and damp, breathing fungi, he is solemn and solitary, his dreams are empty winter-blighted fields, the scream of freezing January winds. Yes, she knows him. Thin, sepulchral, a face of October monuments and gray, fallen headstones, his fingers are decayed church spires, threadbare of gauze-skin, and through it, not bone, but worm-pitted wood and dry rot. Eyes like dead silver moons, a voice like whispering centuries, he is crumbling and stagnant and hollow like a drum.\nFreda closes the curtains, wanting to look no more. A feeling thing in a world devoid of feeling, she is a drop of warm blood on cold concrete. She is wan and pale, her features drawn, protracted even. She mirrors the humanity that has been murdered by Noctulos and nailed tight in a dolorous oblong box. She is a breathing floral tribute to the death of feeling.\nShe is the last one.\nSome time ago, the others all died. Every man, woman, and child were smothered as they slept by the bleak, narcotic shadow of him. What he left in their place were mimics, dummies of wood and wax, dead-eyed things pretending life with saw-dust brains. Things that cannot feel. Freda is the last one. The last living one with blood in her veins and love in her heart and he hates her. God, how he hates her.\nIt is only when she closes the shades of her eyes as she does now, that he gets closer and closer. He wants her emotions, her life, and if he can\u2019t have them, he\u2019ll take her dreams to supplant the ones he is incapable of.\nStretched out on the sagging bed, Freda slips into the nightmare world.\nHis world.\nShe is in a world of stone and dead flowers.\nGraveyard ambience.\nA vault.\nHere, in this mausoleum hallucination that is the yellow, fallen flowers of morgue photos, she waits for her lover. For her lover is death.\nHe comes to her like autumn to summer. There is no turning back. She smells October wind, noisome black earth. He takes her hand. He touches her skin, caresses her curves and valleys. Silk. He smiles then, all promise and whispered pleasure. His eyes are black, deep, cold. Her lips move to his and their touch is fire and ice, life and grave, all intertwined in one sensual skeleton dance.\nIn the distance, the gong of a funereal bell.\nWho? she wonders giddily. Who is this beautiful man?\nWith a coo of mourning doves, he begins to make love to her, showing her sights, sensations she\u2019s never dreamed of, all the while becoming something else. Metamorphosis begins in earnest. No more firm flesh and erotic daydream, oiled hot muscle and soft, searching lips.\nThen she knows.\nKnows as somehow she must have known all along.\nShe has been tricked again, seduced by insanity, loved by death. She was so hungry she did not realize or want to.\nBut now, now\u2026\nHis hair grays, recedes, crumbles away into dust. His skin, once free of blemish like the finest cream, splits and cracks, peels away. Then the eyes, distending, sprout into huge, multi-lobed orbs that peer lasciviously into the nova depths of her soul, taste what they find there, lick it into acrid memory. And she is embracing a writhing, attentive thing that buzzes and buzzes as its bloated hindquarters plant the stinger in her, loving her with it. And the mouth parts, glistening with foul juice and intent, have her tongue and work it, pulling it deeper, deeper into the maw of squirming things.\nAnd she screams and screams, white-hot, and blue, overdose of terror.\nHer shrieking pleas echo around the concrete confines of the burial vault and she knows only bleakness and bitter cold.\nAnd somewhere, a child sings.\nShe knows the voice: it is her own.\nNightmares shredded, frayed, spun into dust worlds.\nFreda is awake but must be sleeping. She feels a thousand manifold lunacies weeping in the mortuary locker of her skull. Each one offers paradise, joy, blissful escape, but delivers only stark, bleeding madness and shrieking solitude.\nWhy? she asks herself, feeding a cigarette between trembling lips. Why am I the last one? Why did he get everyone but me?\nBut there are no answers. She is the dream child of hallucination, addict of time, living flesh memorial of a vanished race. Solitary agent of silent, extinct humanity, cat-and-mouse projection of naked, writhing dream. She is the last player in a game called genocide, the last breath, last hope repository of humankind and in her veins flows the drug of madness: emotion.\nBut she must think, she must plan and scheme. With every nightmare, he gets closer, the stink of his rotting afterbirth breath gets stronger. He is a mist of corruption, a fog of plague and creeping pestilence and she must stop him. She is the headwind of change that can blow and dissipate his noisome aura and noxious atmosphere of chewing shadow. So, the final husk of feeling and sorrow, she must destroy him and, in doing so, save herself and bring godhead blessings of freethought and communal love to the human mannequins and erase their deadwood smiles and melt their cold wax hearts. If she can defeat him, if she can obliterate what he is and is not, then all will be as it was. Children laughing. Birds singing. Lovers loving. Players playing. She must know these things again; the dream of feeling cannot die with her.\nFreda smokes and peers out the ragged cheesecloth curtains. Dead world. Godless world populated by zombie puppets. Marionette strings worked by disease fingers of an obscenity from beyond space, beyond the pathless wastes of time. They pretend to be human, to be living and breathing and feeling. All the things they are incapable of. But Freda knows better. Mannequins do not love. A woodrot brain cannot imagine sonnets and songs.\nFreda gathers up her tricks and temptations in a leather shoulder bag and slips out into a world that smells of ancient candlewax. She will find him tonight. In some dusty, barren, bloodless quarter of this city, he waits. Waits with cobra eyes and jagged jaws dripping with neurotoxins.\nTonight, there will be death or birth or nothingness.\nThe carnival of the damned.\nFreda knows this is the place. What better cover for a freak of creation than a sideshow?\nFreda\u2019s thoughts: hulking, cyclopean, tiny, frightened, prance through the prison corridors of her skull with a steel summer brilliance, nipping and stinging her brain, mosquitoes before an August rain. She studies the mulling crowds which pass by her in dark stenches of cigarette smoke and fried foods. Her eyes are claustrophobic half-moons, psychic mirrors that reflect waxen hell netherworlds. Yes, she sees them. They are disturbing. Vacant, molded effigies that neither love nor feel. They cling to each other, mimic the actions of men and women but understand them no more than carved figurines understand the eruptions of cash registers.\nShe knows and knows very well.\nHe is here. His dead touch is everywhere.\nAn unknown wispy smile clinging to her lips, she leans against the outer flapping edges of the bingo tent and lights a cigarette. She smells clotted grease, mildewed canvas, and stillborn tears on the wind. A pair of lovers cavort through the midway, shamble past her like wind-up, piston-legged toy soldiers. There wear cheesy, chipped, emaciated grins on their garishly-painted faces. They laugh and kiss, but so do puppets when worked by hidden, manipulative hands.\nThey feel nothing, are nothing.\nFurther proof, she thinks flatly. He is here. Is very close now.\nFreda begins walking in their direction, eager to follow them, to study them like insects under a glass. She thinks of killing them as if they can be killed. Can a stick of wood be killed? Can a lump of clay know pain? She could erase their perpetually smiling dolls\u2019 faces, rend their limbs in a storm of sawdust, stomp their plastic hearts, gut them of cog, gear, and pulley. But it would do no good.\nThat which is forever dead cannot truly die.\nShe is a few steps behind them when they stop at the ostentatious perimeter of the HORROR HOUSE, chatting playfully amongst themselves. She looks beyond them and imbibes what she sees: a faded white-bone ticket booth that is angled to one side, no more alive than the mummy who works it. Lurid canvas splashed with gaudy colors depicting (or so they hope) the nightmares of men: severed heads and limbs, spilled viscera and blood, maniacal psychos toting chainsaws and butcher knives \u2014 the usual overabundance of walking cadavers and blood-drinkers in every possible state of decay.\nFreda scowls as the couple pay the lemon-faced pretender at the booth, and slip into the spook house proper. They cast her one wary look and disappear. Oh, they know. They know what she is. They sense her warmth, her depth, and it maddens them.\nFreda digs out two dollars and slides up to the ticket booth. The man does not look at her \u2014 one grimy paw takes her money, pushes a ticket in her direction. The fingers loiter on her own, are snatched back quickly.\nYes, yes, Freda thinks, you know, too, don\u2019t you? You know I am not like you. That I am something you can never be.\nThe pitchman swaying near the entrance smiles down at her much as, some people say, dogs smile \u2014 empty, dead, canine. \u201cEvening, miss,\u201d he growls, staring at the round of her breasts beneath her sweater, knowing they are flesh and blood and hating her for it.\n\u201cYour ticket please,\u201d he croaks.\nShe gives it to him, despising the cold mahogany feel of his hands.\n\u201cGoing in all alone? You might get scared in there, you know.\u201d\nFreda grimaced. What would come next? Would the hunched little jackstraw automaton offer his company? It would be like being held, being comforted by driftwood washed ashore on a sterile beach. \u201cI like to be scared. It\u2019s good for the soul,\u201d she tells him.\n\u201cAs you say, miss.\u201d\nAnd then, the Horror House.\nIt is perfect. What better cover for a crypt-crawler like him? For a thing vomited from dark closets and the wormhole womb of obscene creation?\nAnd in her mind one word:\nNOCTULOS\nShe is in a glittering serpent corridor that twists, turns wildly, knotting up upon itself like coiled viscera. Soon she is completely disoriented. There are mirrors everywhere \u2014 on the walls, the ceiling, even the floor is composed of some polished, reflective material. She watches a dozen distorted, monstrous images of herself stalk along with her, equally unsure as she. Ahead, a vague form disappears into yet another shadowy corridor, leaves a dusty, smoking scent of ashes in its wake. She moves after it, a reek of musty wood and cloistered time assailing her nostrils.\nI am coming for you, she thinks, the words hammering in her brain.\nShe enters a sullen chamber where the mirrors end. Where time and space and anti-reality intersect in fanged shadows, curving surrealistic angles, and gauzy shrouds of crystalline web that breathe and pulse with the starving faces of the unborn. There is mist. Jumbled harmonies sung by toad voices. Silent moonlight that falls to powder when touched. Convex floors that are walls and ceilings and all and neither. Everything is inverted, grotesque, misshapen. Somewhere, an iron bell gongs out hollow, echoing, discordant.\nAnd a voice cackles with insanity and amusement.\nFreda moves through bleeding blossoms of deathhouse flowers. Everything here is colorless, just blacks, whites, grays \u2014 a thousand hybrids of the same. She claws a boiling fog that spirals at her face. It makes a hideous mewling sound, freezes, fans out with myriad cracks, shatters and falls to her feet like broken glass. The air seems bloody and raw, translucent, a biological weave of extradimensional coffin silk. Ruined gulag faces of gray, fluttering satin leer and peer from cellar pits and zigzag balconies that lead nowhere. She is in a gutter between worlds, a depraved lunatic slum of gray mist, broken bodies, and sucking alabaster insects. The place that vomited Noctulos from the subcellar placental slime of sweet disease.\n\u201cShow yourself,\u201d Freda demands. \u201cI'm not afraid of you.\u201d\nThere is movement behind her, shadow-show whisper, the rustling of leaves in a drainage ditch. She had expected many things of Noctulos. She had envisioned his fleshy perversions in detail. But the reality of him is staggering. He has huge, flaking eyes that are blanched leprosy. His skin is raw liver knitted with a snipping, snapping mutiny of black beaks that caw and cry. His face, if you can call such an atrocity a face, is a bloated purple-blue contusion of fluttering fungus slivered with white scars. All of which is washed by a soup of pink tears. And beneath the patchwork, surgeon-stitched flesh there is an evil, plodding, wriggling movement as if some burrowing parasites are trying to find their way out.\nGrinning with three separate toothless maws licked by reptile tongues, Noctulos says, breathes, pants, \u201cBeauty, beauty, beauty.\u201d\n\u201cI am not afraid of you,\u201d Freda tells him and she isn't. Repulsed, yes, but hardly afraid. She slips a hatchet from her bag. The only thing that worries her is what will emerge from him after she hacks him apart, opens him up.\n\u201cNot afraid?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you afraid? Are you blind, child? Look upon me. Look upon me and despair.\u201d\nHis skull is like a hinged, flexible thing that moves, changes, convolutes at will. The mouths become eyes. The eyes disgorge black spiny tongues. Worms slither from every widening pore. The desert confetti hair become snakes, his gnarled hands are soon huge spiders. His face splits in a laughing grin and vomits a spout of rotting ectoplasm at her.\n\u201cNow are you afraid?\u201d a dozen, weeping voices ask.\nFreda shakes her head, steps forward uneasily as the ground tilts, shudders. She sinks the hatchet into his belly. There is a rain of brown syrup. Screams in a distant room. A butcher\u2019s dozen of creamy yellow disk eyes open up and shed tears that are rancid flower petals drifting in the electric air. Gristle, membrane, and sap, Noctulos stumbles back.\n\u201cI need your warmth, Freda,\u201d his scratching glass voice begs. \u201cI need it so badly. Look at me. I am like this because I am cold inside, destitute, desolate, empty. I am limbo and unbirth. I am waiting to be born. I need your emotions. You\u2019re my last hope.\u201d\nFreda is not interested.\nHe is pathetic, nauseous, a hellbent child, spoiled rotten. She begins to hack, to chop, to split. Noctulos comes apart like decayed lumber, coils like a caterpillar trying to protect itself, pops like a squealing flesh balloon in a rain of black gushing putrescence, explodes with a million black fuzz spores.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHis is a running, sizzling, sputtering abstract pool of color in a film noir black and white world. Sweet, sour, stinking, hissing. And finally, a rush of heat and hope and warmth as his puzzle husk gives up all the emotions and feeling it has bled from the world. Freda is giddy with it. Like stars being born. Like fireworks. Like damp night giving forth to sunshine day.\nAnd she is happy, happy, happy.\nNightmares within nightmares.\nFreda wakes like an egg hatching, feels the piercing kiss of acupuncture needles biting her skin. And where, where, where is she? World of white and snow and pillow feathers. Blinding light. Swirling, mushrooming. An oven of static and distant voices.\n\u201cNoctulos,\u201d she whispers. \u201cNoctulos, Noctulos, Noctulos\u2026\u201d\nShe knows then. This is a hospital. They have brought her here after the battle in which she saved the sum of mankind. But why are there leather straps confining her arms, her legs? Why is she not allowed to move? And then she knows that he has won yet again. She has been brought here. She will be kept here. And those needles, yes, with those needles they will steal her emotions, they will bleed her of feeling, leech her of humanity in an IV drip, drip, drip.\nVoices.\nTin can voices.\nNot human.\nWhite mannequin figures stand by the bed.\n\u201cWhy, though?\u201d a voice asks. \u201cWhy would a woman like that, someone perfectly normal, go into a mirror maze and hack up two people she didn\u2019t even know? What the hell was in her head?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in any of their heads?\u201d\n\u201cBut she doesn\u2019t look crazy. Sleeping like that, Christ, she looks innocent and harmless. And a librarian, yet. Go figure. I wonder what\u2019s in her head.\u201d\n\u201cGarbage and blackness, that\u2019s all. You just wait. You wait until you\u2019ve been here as long as I have. The shit you see. Here, help me unstrap her.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if she wakes up?\u201d\n\u201cShe won't. They never do. She\u2019ll be out until tomorrow.\u201d\nYes, Freda thinks, let them think I'm sleeping. Yes, yes, yes\u2026\n\u201cOK, help me lift her up. Heavier than she looks.\u201d\nThere is a steel shriek, an agonized screaming near and yet far. It echoes in sullen blackness.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with that new one? The one next door.\u201d\n\u201cThe screamer? Says he\u2019s possessed. Says something sucked his feelings away, stole them.\u201d\n\u201cBut isn\u2019t that what she said? Something stole her \u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t pay any attention. They\u2019re all mad. You start listening and you\u2019ll see conspiracies everywhere like they do.\u201d\nSuddenly, Freda is not sleeping. She is alive. She is a greased bag of vipers that writhes and flops and fights. She buries her fingers in the eye sockets of the first man, pulls, pulls, pulls, until his howling face comes free in a wet flap. And yes, yes, yes! She was right! Inside, no blood, no tissue, no musculature, just cog wheels and gears and wires and gushing lubricants. Her fingers are drenched with them.\nRunning red.\nAnd in the next room, a high, evil laughter from some black sewer of reality.\nNoctulos.\n\u2022\n\u00a9 2000 Tim Curran, all rights reserved","source":null,"source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/Poxmi9pfRqX2ypOug+o3Uicjq4w.json"}

The blooms opened, a zig-zagging spiral of saffron and gold, and Cormac opened with them. The air was still full of dust from inside and soot from without, still hazy with steam. But whorled within, flecks that were neither flax nor coal nor wood char shimmered. Called out as they whisked across quivering belts on pulleys, giggled in their twirl about spindles and gear axles.\n\u201cHow do you look at anything else?\u201d Cormac whispered to Mother, nose down in her work. She locked her gaze the way that would have meant a whipping, but Cormac didn\u2019t mind now that thauma flashed behind her eyes.\nMother\u2019s stiff-wire fingers squeezed their upper arms and their objections from them. \u201cWhere did you work it?\u201d\nThe whistle sounded before Cormac could answer, and even Mother\u2019s loom stopped running.\n\u201cDid I do\u2014?\u201d\nThe flash in Mother\u2019s eyes swallowed Cormac\u2019s voice. Even if it hadn\u2019t, the overseer\u2019s bellow would have crushed it, same as his boot heel tromped the abandoned dandelions to a smear on his myopic, floor-shaking march across the workroom.\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you at your loom?\u201d he said.\n\u201cLooms aren\u2019t running,\u201d Mother said.\n\u201cSounds to me like the best time to oil and clean.\u201d He fixed Mother with a glare that would never notice the dancing fire in hers, the amber of his eyes dull in Cormac\u2019s new sight.\n\u201cEven so.\u201d Iridescent thauma made way for her and caught in her wake, gathered at the hem of her skirts.\n\u201cYou\u2014\u201d The sweep of the overseer\u2019s paddle-wide hands snared Cormac\u2019s mate Purdie in his wave. He held three stacked pence between Purdie and himself, edges sunk into the callus of thumb and forefinger. \u201cThis for the taint keeper.\u201d He added three more. \u201cThis for you if you get one here before my teakettle boils.\u201d\nCormac thought to raise up their own finger, tip scabbed black, and claim the coin. Might fetch a whole Cornish hen, that, for the right haggle. Drips of red were a price they\u2019d pay to wash away the pitch that stained their palms and beset their nostrils. Instead, flecks of iridescence and gold swarmed their tongue, bound their arms, knotted their voice. They didn\u2019t need to turn to see Mother\u2019s work in it.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nShe hadn\u2019t. Oh, she had tried. Had locked the door to the alcove and forbidden Cormac go anywhere near it. But words weren\u2019t wards, so near is where they went when Mother channeled. She\u2019d never noticed the gap above the croaking hinge, dryrot-split wide enough for Cormac\u2019s right eye if they pulled their shoulder in, pressed against the wall shared with the neighbors who smelled of rosemary and the charnel house.\nMother did a better job hiding the hen from the landlord, at cost of her own blood. Still a gentler price than indenture at the workhouse if she was caught working magic. A prick of the finger, and for it the landlord heard pipes rattle instead of clucking, found his eyes drawn to a flash of light if the wind caught a bit of white fluff. Cormac was jealous of how he smelled soot in place of hen droppings.\nThe hen gave good eggs. More important, she supplied Mother for her work. One small vial, drawn from the neck after prayers on Sunday, kept Mother\u2019s loom running without snags or broken threads. Cormac blocked the mundane weavers\u2019 sight while Mother channeled thauma. They witnessed the patterns she painted in the frame at the factory, but most days the overseer swatted at the back of their head and barked them off to clean under the looms, or set them to piecing before they could study them proper.\nIt didn\u2019t matter how often or long they studied. The runes were different every day, or they felt different every day, or at least they wouldn\u2019t stay put in Cormac\u2019s head and never meant anything more than gibberish drifting through their mind. They busied themself brushing out bits of flax, oiling machinery so long that they could scrub away every bit of flesh on their palms easier than they could rid themself of the sharp stink of grease.\nUntil dandelions.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cDifferent. Not more,\u201d Mother said. \u201cOr more, but not better.\u201d\nShe took them to the alcove, and they watched this time. For most spells, the hen was enough. Needn\u2019t offer much to convince the thauma to keep a string in place, help a fire last longer, freshen stale bread. At least, not any more.\nGreat-grandfather used to have to kill a chicken for each spell, and a dozen greatfolk before that, the last time thauma opened a channel in their family, it only listened to the call of a soul sacrificed to it. But if Samuel Crompton could work out the spinning mule, seemed a foolish kind of magic couldn\u2019t make itself easier to keep pace.\nThat was Cormac\u2019s idea, at least. Mother had an alternative: \u201cThese days the mundane demands plenty enough blood from us on its own. Figure magic doesn\u2019t see the need to demand any more. Not special enough if it did. And magic wants special. Thauma breaks every rule but its own.\u201d\nThis was what Cormac loved most about thauma, even before they opened. It cared for structures and rules as much as Cormac did, which was to say as little as possible. Why did women work looms and men work mines and gangly children squirm into tiny spaces for both? And why was it that people who did none of the labor took the coin and used it to build mansions and throw fancy parties?\nCormac had snuck into one once, with Purdie. A mansion, not a party. A party would have meant a bustle and a corset or tails and a cummerbund, and either option was another set of rules not worth having. But Purdie\u2019s cousin worked the kitchens, and before one of the parties, when the lady of the house brought in extra help, they\u2019d managed to slide in with the washer women and the chimney sweeps and the window cleaners and the butcher\u2019s and the baker\u2019s boys.\nThere were windows so high and wide they made more sun inside than out, light that bounced off the bevels of an army of cut glass, gleamed in the curves of brass and gold. Drapes long as an entire roll off the loom, thick and lush, embroidered with a million stories. Iron wrought in flourishes to hold more candles for one evening than Cormac imagined they and Mother used in a year.\nIt had been worth the swearing and the chase when they were caught. Worth the beating the constable gave them. It had been the most beautiful sight, that mansion, and a foolish world that ruled only a precious few could enjoy it.\nIt was a garbage heap in the shadow of thauma.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMother cut open the back of her forearm. She knew where to cut to avoid risking her work on the loom, but a place that healed clean wasn\u2019t the same as a place without pain. She bit down until cords popped in her neck. Squeezed a spare bit of dough to quicken the ripe cherry runnels between her knuckles, into the bowl. Mother steadied the hiss of her breath while Cormac tied linen around the wound.\nThauma swarmed above the bowl, along the line of Mother\u2019s arm. She dipped one finger in, knuckles bony from the loom, then began writing. Blood hung in the air. Symbols that had always slipped away before now sang Cormac their secrets. This one\u2019s swirls called to the belly. The ragged triplet summoned pain. An interlaced binding, sight, blood\u2014\n\u201cNo.\u201d It didn\u2019t matter that Cormac had never read the spell before. They knew the curse Mother was writing upon them, but not before the air slurped the blood-wrought runes hanging in space. Flecks of infinity raced through Cormac\u2019s squeezed eyelids, down their throat despite sealed lips.\nWhen they opened their eyes again, Mother raised her finger. The sight of sticky red on its tip sent lightning through Cormac\u2019s eyes and belly, staggered them out of the alcove rather than witness another moment of it.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause none of mine get bled dry for a bolt of cloth or a richer vein of ore,\u201d Mother said.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThey tried to acclimate. If a finger could grow a callous, and a cut sealed to a tougher scar, perhaps a body\u2019s insides might work the same. Thauma didn\u2019t work that way, or it made the pain worse each time to compensate for whatever Cormac learned to accept. Before this, Cormac would have sworn a dozen oaths that nothing would be more vile to their senses than the grease stench entrenched in the lines of their palms. Now, four months of trying still left them kneeling in a puddle of sick before they could write a single, bloody glyph.\nThey turned their back to Mother\u2019s runes each morning, as much to avoid Mother as the blood. But there was only so long they could bend their head to clean under clattering hot machines when the world was ready to turn sideways instead. When they finally looked, a different burning rose inside them at the flash and twinkle of thauma in Mother\u2019s loom. The waltz of the impossible gleamed all around, invited them to join in the vibrant gambol, and Mother had chosen to bind Cormac hand and foot.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cIf it were,\u201d she said, \u201cthe overseer would be pulling water and butterflies from thin air.\u201d\nThe girl who followed Cormac back was thin and knobby all over like Mother\u2019s fingers. Cormac snatched her elbow to stop her walking through a puddle of filth.\n\u201cDid you channel away your sense of smell?\u201d Cormac asked. It was the first time she met their gaze, and Cormac smiled a greeting to the swirling thauma in her eyes.\n\u201cWhy do you need me?\u201d She nodded to the motes that swam in Cormac\u2019s own.\n\u201cCurse,\u201d they said. \u201cBlood makes me sick.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they say about me.\u201d\n\u201cBecause they\u2019re blind.\u201d\n\u201cVision doesn\u2019t much matter when they lock all the shutters against the light.\u201d\nCormac\u2019s knees itched. They stopped talking, headed back toward the shop as a cloud passed overhead. Except it wasn\u2019t a cloud, or not the kind they thought. Billowy and blotting out bits of sun, this one wasn\u2019t made of rain, but smoke.\nCormac snagged the workhouse girl\u2019s brittle wrist, stomach cold and heavy, and dragged her forward. They couldn\u2019t miss the overseer barking at the throng, but Mother was nowhere along the edges. They pressed forward, pinched and shoved against hips plump and bony, were met with squeals and curses shouted and whispered and growled in a dozen voices that hadn\u2019t reared Cormac. Grease and soot and sweat filled each quickening breath, but even the tang they couldn\u2019t quite identify wasn\u2019t from Mother. A beefy set of forearms shoved them out of the press of bodies and into Purdie.\n\u201cMusta been a worse problem with the steam than they thought,\u201d he said. \u201cCaught fire on one machine then ran straight across the threads to the others.\u201d\n\u201cMy mother?\u201d\nHe frowned.\n\u201cCan you stop it?\u201d Cormac whispered to the channel girl. She laughed.\n\u201cAre you cursed with stupid, as well?\u201d She flopped both flimsy hands at the blooms of fire and smoke. \u201cIsn\u2019t enough blood in my whole body to end that. You\u2019d need a body full grown and well-fed just to stand a chance.\u201d\nMother was one of those two. And maybe if she took some from Cormac, they\u2019d amount to well-fed together.\nThere was an undulation in the streams of thauma. Cormac took it for agreement and bolted through the choking black that drifted from the front door. Calls followed them, but not their name or reaching hands.\nThey shoved the door open, then shoved again against the press of heat on the other side. Fire licked up the walls, whipped bright and vibrant across threads and frames. Smoke slithered upward, gathered at the ceiling, tangled and swelled in a mating ball of black and grey. Thauma cavorted in the spaces between. Its dance shone past the sting of soot in their eyes, and Cormac cursed it for abandoning them, leaving them to dodge the strike of yellow-orange fangs. Cursed its carefree amble of beauty in the billowing darkness that scraped its way down Cormac\u2019s throat.\nThen they realized this dance was not without pattern. That the iridescent spin and swirl flourished, yes, but with purpose. With direction they could follow.\nThey pressed on until the dome of Mother\u2019s spell shone through the smoke, thauma beating back the snapping maw of the flames. Cormac didn\u2019t think about what the dome meant until they pushed through the ashy fog. They had time enough for Mother\u2019s chest to rise once before the flash of blood along the edge of Mother\u2019s protection circle burned Cormac\u2019s eyes and stabbed their belly.\nCormac squeezed their eyes shut, wiped the porridge of stale bread and bile off their lips, and called out, \u201cMother!\u201d\nThe growl and hiss of fire was the only answer. They didn\u2019t know if Mother fell from the smoke or the heat or if she might still be bleeding. They turned away from her and opened their eyes.\nThe motes were too bright for the black smoke to dim, brighter than the fire even at its heart. Thauma called and cried and sang, danced promises to swallow all the fire away if Cormac painted enough to quench its thirst. But the thauma would also tear through Cormac\u2019s head and rend their guts if they so much as bit their lip, long before they could drag a bloody finger in a single sigil.\nThey cried into their hands to stop choking on impossible riddles, coughed at the cloying scent of grease on their palms. This was what caught fire. This was what burned. Their blood could run a thousand steam engines better than the useless black muck that fed the fire. Fire which would sooner or later devour the floor beneath Mother and gulp her down, because Cormac couldn\u2019t offer sacrifice.\nCouldn\u2019t offer it to the thauma, at least. Whether they bled or not, the mill had happily drunk Cormac dry since they were old enough to carry scraps. And not just Cormac: Mother. Purdie. Every spinner, piecer, scavenger, weaver. At least a tenement\u2019s worth of souls daily poured their lives out until it soaked into every drop of grease that turned gears and pulleys.\n\u201cAnd what foolish kind of magic is it,\u201d Cormac said, \u201cthat would let grease keep all that sacrifice for itself?\u201d\nThe thauma stilled briefly, then quivered in Cormac\u2019s ears with a new, eager pitch. Cormac drug one shaking finger through a thick patch of grease and started painting. They followed the whorls and sweeps of dancing thauma, the patterns of forever, with a fingertip thick with both grease and the accumulated life that grease had stolen.\nThe motes drank it in. Thauma breaks every rule but its own, and it wouldn\u2019t be outdone. The air chilled. Fire sizzled, shrunk, chuffed into wisps of ash.\nMother gasped, and Cormac drew a deep breath full of lingering char, themself.\n\u201cThey won\u2019t wait long to enter,\u201d Cormac said. \u201cYou should clean the blood before they do.\u201d\nShe gave a puzzled grunt, but the rasp of fabric scrubbing wood worked a staccato pattern behind Cormac.\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone.\u201d The dirt and hair clinging to her cheeks wasn\u2019t new, nor even the slump of her shoulders, but there was something new in the way Mother looked at Cormac. Not looked. Studied. \u201cHow?\u201d\nThey offered her their hand instead of words, lead her to the patterns drawn in grease.\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t how it works,\u201d Mother said. \u201cBlood rules thauma, not grease.\u201d\n\u201cThauma breaks every rule\u2014\u201d Cormac said.\n\u201c\u2014But its own,\u201d Mother finished. Cormac worked one more symbol, then all of the writing melted away with a sigh. They eased the rag out of Mother\u2019s hand, showed it clean of her blood.\n\u201cNever cared much for rules, myself,\u201d Cormac said. It was a quip, but that didn\u2019t make it untrue. It\u2019s why they loved magic for so long, why the two of them had been waiting for each other since they came into the world.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue34\/3lbe34_story2.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"Cormac's mother twice-cursed the day thauma opened a channel through them, though only one curse was the magical kind.

Laden counts themself lucky. They\u2019ve worked with the best. Banned by the Interplanetary Fragrance Association, reminiscent of ancient Earth\u2019s oakmoss and ambergris, the properties of these rare alien plant resins and invasive geological strains can\u2019t be chemically synthesized with any accuracy on Earth. The depth of basenotes and longevity of their fixative properties resist simple duplication. Organic compounds of such complexity can only be hunted and harvested in the wild.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nStuffing twin orifices with baggies of rare substances, Taj wipes Laden\u2019s tears in calculated foreplay. His fingers come away sparkling. \u201cYou\u2019ll take one more for me, won\u2019t you?\u201d Taj kisses their neck and inserts another packet. Laden sighs, or maybe whimpers.\n\u201cThat\u2019s my guy.\u201d Taj sounds a little more possessive than Laden would like. \u201cI knew you\u2019d be into this. It doesn\u2019t hurt too much, does it?\u201d\nIt hurts, and it\u2019s a weepingly exotic sensation of coming undone by gradual steps, and it\u2019s an unwilling yet voluntary act under the terms Taj has implied and Laden\u2019s continual acceptance. After all is said and done, Laden\u2019s the type to do anything for love.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Laden says, hiding pain tinged with pleasure behind an arched arm.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a fiend for it, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nLaden tries not to think of words like sneer and scorn as they cringe at Taj\u2019s imperceptible change in warmth. Laden says, \u201cI want you.\u201d\n\u201cOne or two more.\u201d Taj caresses Laden closer to climax, spreading them wide. He puts his serpent\u2019s tongue to use in silence as he slicks and stuffs the last packet deep enough to hide it from a casual pat-down.\nLaden\u2019s periphery melts into an impossible confusion of warring impressions after Taj\u2019s opening blast of smoked leather and oud. Masculine woody notes are followed by a soapy heart reminiscent of vetiver, and a topping off of potpourri florals with a hint of ash. Projection is poor. Later on in the spacecraft, as the sad reality of the situation settles on their skin, Laden will savor the drydown of resinous amber and underlying spice: leftovers of Taj\u2019s fleeting attentions.\n\u201cThe first time\u2019s always the hardest,\u201d Taj says with a perfunctory peck before boarding. Laden doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s the last time they\u2019ll be alone with him for the next three years. \u201cDon\u2019t panic if it pinches a bit later, babe. That\u2019s just me tickling your fancy the whole way there.\u201d Those wicked eyes. Taj knows how to use them against all thought of protest.\nA tolerance for strong, persistent odors made Laden an immediate asset, as well as their ability to evade detection at checkpoints. Three years taking it up the trunk from Pluto to Paris and back across the Kuiper Belt; Taj seduces Laden endlessly without sating.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nLaden\u2019s outlasted everyone else in the life. A dubious accolade; most quit with muscular and emotional boundaries intact. Taj is right about their fiendishness, Laden admits, right about everything except his own unspoken and elastic dominance. His latest love note to Laden curls from the air\u2019s clinging dampness where it fell from their livid fingers and landed upside down in a small arc on the hotel nightstand. A cartoon frown.\nTucked into the strange bouquet of flowers\u2014not really flowers, though, not in a hotel this far from the Sun, but multicolored polyanthemous lichen undulating on cultured stalks \u2014 was an invitation to deceive or be deceived:\nLaden aches with the ghost of sillage past. They ache for Taj daily while riding the interplanetary transit lines, their body packed full of product, expanding pores overhydrated into hypoxia. The plastic baggies aren\u2019t an impermeable barrier, not over the distances Laden travels. No quantity of extra water intake can mitigate the effects of uncanny compounds leeching through into Laden\u2019s mucous membranes. Substances rare and untested accumulate like the Earth\u2019s muddy yearnings. The chemical signature of unrequited love, the microbiological evolution of a new ecosystem within their organs and blood; whatever it is, Laden feels their body awakening.\nUnique hungers require unique ways to feed.\nLaden strips down to nothing in the hotel bathroom and pours the remainder of the champagne. They inhale aromatic steam across the transient bubbles. A benthic scent rising from the bathtub infiltrates their deepest marrow. Six months of product dissolves in the hot water. Six months of work swirls and then stills under the closed tap.\nLaden steps into the fragrant steaming liquid. The surface is thick. Enhanced with the galaxy\u2019s largest store of animal secretions and extruded tars, restricted stamens, barks, and fungal inoculated mineral ephemera, the sludge water parts around Laden\u2019s toe and invites them in deeper, deeper.\nRelaxing into the warm brew like lying down in the contours of a lover\u2019s arms, quicksand sucks them under without argument. Laden\u2019s never resisted the life. Without the dream of Taj, there\u2019s even less to resist now. Laden allows invisible opercula to expand in their neck. Hidden gill slits seek a converse anaerobic essence as Laden transcends their breath. Fragrance pervades in tangible harmony, a physical presence imbuing each pore.\nLaden\u2019s orifices have grown more lush over the years, blossoming strange with rapacious pangs of desire on those long, lonely sprints across the solar system. How hollow their crammed parts wailed, weighted in the safety seat, craving the bastard\u2019s touch. Deprived, an erotic mutation took place.\nUnfolding a repetition of innards, hidden cetacean spaces adapting with willful girth and cavernous dignity, Laden further submerges. Breath is an unneeded luxury. Underneath the sludge, they absorb it all. Ondine seeks soul: no pretenders need apply. There\u2019s a raw sensation of crying, yet somehow backwards, as if Laden ingests tears to invoke new, more elaborate losses.\nChampagne forgotten, extremities cooling, Laden lifts an arm from the empty tub. Scales glimmer, crusting over the soft sponginess of Laden\u2019s fresh thalassic flesh. There\u2019s a knock on the hotel room door, and then another, and another. Someone\u2019s been tapping for a while. Laden feels new when they try to move.\nStanding is like swimming, walking a listing movement like a floating stroll. Laden clicks off the overhead lights, leaves one lamp on by the bedside. Draped in the plentiful hotel robe, the curved edges of their scales might read as shadows of arm hair and chest hair, optical illusions in the low light. They check the peephole. No surprise.\nLaden opens the door and drifts backwards into shadow on the undertow of the air currents in the swampy room.\nSensations born of a sea-change, perceptive synesthesia: Laden smells Stormtrash Irene\u2019s mood before the assault of her voice strikes home. \u201cThe honeymoon suite? Are you kidding me?\u201d\nLichenoid flowers glow, curled notecard flutters; Laden tosses Taj\u2019s love letter over to Irene. The corner ink smears where Laden\u2019s damp fingers press a netted pattern of scales. \u201cNot my idea. Recognize the signature?\u201d\nIrene glares and Laden marvels at her violent aroma of diesel and astringent. Over-sensitized, Laden follows the thoughts cycling through by tracking Irene\u2019s changing fragrances. She smacks the card repeatedly against the palm of her half-open fist. Her downcast eyes cancel repressed tears while keeping close watch on her supposed antagonist. Laden gets a whiff of simmering smoke with a tinge of metal, the scent of an electrical fire.\nLaden says, \u201cWe both know he\u2019s not worth it.\u201d\n\u201cNone of them are. Not in this business.\u201d Stormtrash Irene answers too quickly to be believable. She holds the card out to Laden, but not too far from her body. It\u2019s a challenge or invitation to come closer. Ozone and asteroid ash, smoldering. Though she adopts a casual pose, Laden scents the weapon Irene hides in her belt.\nIrene sounds genuine. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you begged me to come back from Triton early for this love triangle bullshit. I\u2019m already over it. Stealing my product, though?\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cMan, he\u2019s going to pay for that. Come on. Let\u2019s load up the stash and get you home.\u201d\nLaden\u2019s no longer denying the evidence of their senses. Camaraderie with an iron finish. A tangy note of blood. Laden glides backwards into dimmer and dimmer light, slippery and silent.\nIrene flaps the love note. \u201cWhat do you want, a cookie? Take your little memento and get moving.\u201d\nLaden wobbles their head back and forth slowly in undulating waves. They want to speak, but the words seep upwards in slow motion. Menacing spice prickles in Laden\u2019s nostrils leaving a path of needles and pins. They see what\u2019s coming clearly over the waves. With their new fins, they can\u2019t dogpaddle fast enough to flee.\nLunging fast for the wrist, Irene wrenches Laden\u2019s right forearm behind their back. She twists it around and holds it high between the shoulder blades. Brings the hidden blade to their belly trapping Laden\u2019s left arm under a wiry bicep.\nA pampered mule is no match for Irene, even if Irene\u2019s six inches shorter in high heels. \u201cI\u2019ll cut it out of you if you don\u2019t hand it over, I swear to god. That\u2019s six months of my hard work stuffed in your cracks.\u201d\n\u201cA trade,\u201d Laden says, not yet claiming that immersion has made the necessity of an exchange a biological fact. \u201cI have an offer. What would you give for a steady supply of oakmoss and ambergris?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing anymore. Not outside of a museum.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, true; but imagine something better, more fragrant, more persistent and unique. Look in the mirror at me for a moment before you decide. Look, Stormy. Feel my skin.\u201d\nThe robe has slipped in response to Irene\u2019s violence. Laden\u2019s torso glows undraped. With Irene pinning from behind, enough light emerges to show something large and twisted in the garment\u2019s folds. A confusion of anatomy in the mirror: white plush versus pink ducts, pulsating tracts below Irene\u2019s knife. She snaps her focus to the thickened arm in her grasp. The skin is blueish, wrapped in netting; no, she realizes, that\u2019s not netting. The pattern is part of the layered, fish-like hide. Stormtrash Irene registers the texture of scales.\nShe shoves Laden away. \u201cFuck!\u201d\nWeapon raised, Irene flicks on the light switch. From a distance, she looks Laden up and down quickly, repeatedly. Billowing rubber aromas, biting scent of awestruck bile. \u201cJesus,\u201d says Irene, \u201cHow long has it been? You should have quit the life years ago, you crazy fuck.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t quit. I am the life.\u201d\nLaden allows the odors of horror and disdain to dissipate until they soften into peppery undertones. A touch of pine rises in Stormtrash Irene\u2019s lively mind. She\u2019s interested.\nThe dam breaks. Laden\u2019s message flows. \u201cLook at me. You won\u2019t need a recruiter anymore. Taj is obsolete. He lied to you all along, like he lied to me. I can fix this imbalance. You won\u2019t need sources or transport. People will come to you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d\nThe robe drapes open. Laden leaves it hanging slack. Their unusual new organ stirs in the folds. Irene takes a step back. Laden says, \u201cWhen whales on ancient earth had squid beaks stuck in their guts, their bodies made ambergris to isolate the waste. Before they went extinct, no one ever figured out if they vomited ambergris or passed it through the digestive tract. No one knew why a few whales made it but most didn\u2019t. It\u2019s still a mystery. No one can make it happen in a lab.\u201d\n\u201cIs this a biology lesson? Get to the point.\u201d\nLaden\u2019s not in a rush. \u201cDo you know what that\u2019s like, to have something stuck in your gut, something you want, something you gave up everything to get, but it only makes you hurt? It grinds and prods your insides day and night. It drives you ballistic. The worst possible itch. I wanted Taj. Sacrificed for him. He\u2019ll never love me.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so dramatic. That\u2019s just how he is.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to give him to me.\u201d\n\u201cWhere the hell is my stash?\u201d\n\u201cI ate your stash. Just like I\u2019ll eat him.\u201d Laden holds up an altered hand. \u201cWatch.\u201d\nLaden\u2019s embarrassed about being seen so exposed, but their hair-trigger response makes it quick after three years of frustrated longing. They close their eyes and reach down to explore their anomalous organ, feeding it a morsel from the room service tray. Pleasure spikes with a pure vetiver scent: the image of Taj\u2019s tongue. A heavy sensation builds inside Laden\u2019s abdomen. Pressure explodes like a seed sending out roots, splitting the hard shell in half, and bursting open with the first primal shoots of a robust plant. The smell is something new and green. Laden hatches a warm lump of grey waxy muck with a heave of erotic relief. An impossible fragrance pervades the hotel room.\nLaden buoys on their webbed feet and sinks down on the bed as if drifting to the sea floor, dreaming of Taj\u2019s lips, fingers, eyes. All the beautiful parts of him, eluding Laden\u2019s gullet for so long.\nThey\u2019d have been satisfied to have him as a lover, a husband. Their body won\u2019t allow that now.\nStormtrash Irene sways, overwhelmed by the intoxicating fragrance. She touches the small pebble of aromatic substance, pressing a finger into the waxy surface. Accosted by a verdant haze, Irene\u2019s olfactory glands flood her with happy memories, real or imagined. Endorphins trigger a complex positive neural response.\nIrene emits the clean floral of easy greed. Laden is pleased. Weapon tossed aside, Irene bounces down onto the coverlet where Laden reclines. \u201cBaby, are you saying you want to be my golden goose just to get a bite of that piece of shit Taj?\u201d\nCoy, Laden blinks twice.\nIrene smacks the mattress with an auctioneer\u2019s finality. \u201cDone. I\u2019ll serve him up to you myself, one bloody chunk at a time. I don\u2019t give a fuck. Oh, hell yeah.\u201d\nThe image of Taj\u2019s tongue cut out. The savory morsel Laden craves. The hunger of elaborate internal organs engineered to digest intolerable oppression. Laden closes the white robe around their intuitive body, moisture vast as the ocean rising inside. Tides of desire and sadness give way to waves of delight in becoming an original and distinct species. Laden suppresses their smile before pressing the next important point. Their eyes open wide and pouty. \u201cHe won\u2019t last forever, Stormy. What happens to me then?\u201d\nThe fungal smell of extinction rises replete with the talcum wonder of a newborn. It\u2019s a paradoxical accord, difficult for an unrefined palette to appreciate.\nWell-versed in the silent language of fragrances, Irene grasps the solution in seconds. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole galaxy full of beautiful liars. Believe me, they\u2019re one species that\u2019s never going to disappear, and I\u2019ve got a real knack for rooting them out. You and me are in business.\u201d\nA galaxy once exploited will wash what Laden needs onto their shore and reward them for revenge on the invasive human species. They nurse hunger pangs that reek with the rot of multitudes, with newly decimated planets, with too much empty death, and they know their transformative alien organ will be fulfilled. Laden will never go hungry again.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue35\/3lbe35_story2.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"Tearing open plastic baggies with a hotel pen, Laden laces the running bath with fragrant stolen compounds.

Peter sadly lifted his head and left her.\n\u201cYour uncle is here for you,\u201d the doctor said with a kind smile. Peter didn\u2019t answer, because she wasn\u2019t supposed to be there.\nThe Queen said Uncle was supposed to be there, though. Peter watched the worn, angular man draw nearer. The Queen said every story needed a villain.\n\u201cC\u2019mon. Time to go home,\u201d Uncle sighed.\nPeter obediently followed. Behind them, the doctor jotted notes in her case file.\nThe sleek bell-caparisoned mice that drew the car tossed their heads when Peter hummed them a song. Uncle kept yanking the car away from where they wanted to go, and it made the mice scream.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Uncle ordered when the car stopped. Peter\u2019s heart ached for the poor steeds standing broken in their harnesses, legs wide, mouths bleeding. Uncle wearily lifted him, carrying him inside the pumpkin.\nPeter didn\u2019t like the pumpkin. It was hollowed out and dead. The Eater had gotten to it. The Eater got to everything, eventually. It would get to him, too. And then Peter would be all dry and withered, with his guts all stringy with seeds, spread on a sheet of newspaper in the kitchen. And then the Eater would put a bright candle inside his head.\n\u201cPlease, Peter, you have to eat,\u201d Uncle pleaded. Peter turned his head away, attention caught by the knife. It sang to him, high and sweet, an Eater song, a King song.\n\u201cCareful \u2013 no!\u201d Uncle snatched it away from him. The magic blade bit Uncle\u2019s fingers and he yelped, dropping it. Peter smiled at the clatter that sounded like a voice singing.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not okay to touch!\u201d Uncle slapped him with one hand, holding his hurt hand curled into a fist and pressed against his chest. Peter rocked back with the blow, a horse of wood.\n\u201cAw, Christ, kid. I\u2019m sorry. I just can\u2019t handle this\u2026\u201d Uncle ran his good hand through his hair and picked up the sword, sliding it into his pocket. The song was muted. \u201cOkay, Peter. Please, be good today. Eat something for me.\u201d\nPeter slowly lifted his fork and plunged it into the pie. The birds screamed and blood oozed from the crust to the plate, warm and steaming. Peter drew a sharp breath and waited for the King to come from his counting-house.\n\u201cOh, now what\u2019s the matter? It\u2019s going to be one of those days, isn\u2019t it? I don\u2019t know why I do this to myself. God forgive me, sometimes I wish you\u2019d been in the car with Ev and Eileen.\u201d Uncle leaned over him. \u201cC\u2019mon Peter, snap back to the real world. Hello? Reality calling. I need you to look at me.\u201d The girls were crying and Uncle\u2019s hands were big black spiders and there was only one thing to do about a villain.\nPeter pulled the magic sword out of Uncle\u2019s pocket. It sang fearfully as it rose and slashed.\nUncle roared and leaped backward, hands clapped to his face, blood streaming between his fingers. Peter leaped up and swung, and oh, it felt so good, and the King wouldn\u2019t be angry after all because Uncle fell from the tower to the brambles below, all red and noisy.\nAnd now the Eater would come with bring a candle to put in Uncle\u2019s head. Peter let the magic sword fall. Two blind mice screeched and scuttled away, bumping into walls and table legs, fresh blood streaming from the stump of their tails.\n\u201cMommy? Daddy?\u201d he breathed. The mice rolled over and stared at him with glazed eyes.

That kind of night was different than the one I am named after; electric stars were scattered throughout the room \u2014 red, green, blinking.\nDuring the Brethren\u2019s raid on the Institute of Bio-Reconstruction Research for the Glory of God, a rebel named Davis carried me over his shoulder through a cascade of bullets. Feathers drifted to the ground in our wake and were tossed up again in the commotion. Outside, Davis set me down on the ground, and I looked on the blank gray face of my home, the Institute, for the first time.\nThen I collapsed under the vast expanse of the sky held up only by buildings.\nScreams echoed up into the sky between the towers and vanished, and I thought those people must be dying. That\u2019s what dying sounded like in the Institute: voices dropping away. Of course, those in the street were human voices, not the cacophonous trills and shrieks, the sonic screams and howls of what was made at the Institute.\nOnce, when I was born, I was human.\nWhat does your name mean to you? they ask. They have so many questions. You may think my name is from another language, I say, but really it is a river in Bangladesh, a place I have visited. I have stood upon its broad green banks to look over the calm silver rush of the river. I have decided: That was my father\u2019s homeland.\nAs I speak, the group of them stare wide-eyed at where my arms should be, and I know the question they are not asking: What did they plan to do with you at the Institute? I know they are thinking about Michael \u2014 Michael from behind the stars. That was just before the Institute got me. I have heard the story of his flight to earth a thousand times; we all have in the city of the Temple-Capitol. The Glory Party retells that story daily, how he came down on sun-white wings, heralding the righteousness of the Glory\u2019s coup d'\u00e9tat.\nAfter Davis and the other Brethren emancipated me from the Institute, it took a while to get used to the homogeneity of the human population. Gone were the feather and gear, fang and cog, hoof and claw components merged with human flesh. They told me I had been misused; that my wings were a corruption, a heinous mimicry of Michael.\nI have learned that Michael\u2019s name has only one meaning: he like unto God.\nThe story of my own destiny is another I have heard thousand-fold. The Glory needed to show to all doubters that Michael had come from the behind the stars, from a place no human being could come from: Heaven. Once they completed my wings, I would prove Michael was truly an angel of God. That\u2019s why the Institute doctors called me their Blessed \u2014\nBut I know what my name is. I know it means the first birdcall at the edge of morning just as the sun\u2019s rays brush treetops.\nThe Brethren doctors told me that the Glory had perverted the word of God and manufactured Michael\u2019s miraculous appearance to convince the public of their righteousness. They reassured me I was safe now from the Glory\u2019s corruption and their wicked experiments at the Institute. I lived in a small white room at the Brethren\u2019s hospital, so the doctors could study what had been done to me. But sometimes that place reminded me of the Institute. Sometimes they let me out to see others, but in my mind the heavy white door with the dull silver doorknob \u2014 it locked from the outside \u2014 began to resemble the metal bars of the enclosure I had known before.\nThey were fascinated by what had been done to me at the Institute. They took me from my room and sat me upon a bed of white paper and blue threadbare sheets beneath a gold light. They asked about the procedure, but I told them what I wanted to say: what I could remember of what it was like before the wings, and of when I was a child, before the Institute recon-physicians replaced my arms. And of a time barely recalled when a dark-haired woman held out a square cracker to me, and I took it with fingers of flesh and nail. When the doctors persisted about the procedure, I said I acquired elongated phalanges and limbs covered with variegated feathers. My fingers beneath the feathers are almost a foot long,I told them. They nodded impatiently, frustrated that I could tell them no more than the obvious. When they returned from a private conference, one of the doctors told me with wonder, You are quite like Michael, as far as our specialists can tell. Very like Michael.\nOver and over, they prodded and examined and questioned. Their curiosity made me feel uneasy. Sometimes, though, Davis visited. He asked the same questions as the physicians, but he was always pleased to see me \u2014 always kind. He understood the difficulty of my situation. Once, he brought me a gift: a book of birds with illustrations so vivid they looked real. Aren\u2019t they beautiful, he said. You are like them now. Maybe someday you can fly, if you want. It was the only gift I have ever been given. So I did not tell him I could find no bird picture with my name beneath it. There are no birds like me.\nAfter a few months, they allowed people into the hospital common room \u2014 people from the television stations and some who had heard of the rescues from the Institute. That is when the questions became much more difficult; that is when they asked about my name.\nThose times, I longed to be human again. I reminded myself: My name means the hushed feeling one gets watching shadows play across summer blades of grass. It connotes delicate breeze in the language it comes from; gentle sway of meadow grasses.\nSome weeks later, news came of how the Brethren of Truth had stormed the Temple-Capitol and followed an underground tunnel to a secret chamber where they captured the Glory priest-president\u2019s entire cabinet. News of the Glory counter-strike, and the Brethrens\u2019 move to quell it, surged over the television.\nLater that night someone \u2014 not a doctor and not a television man \u2014 came to talk to me. He told me the government needed to convince civilians throughout the country that the Brethren were acting to liberate them. Do you understand that? he said, and put his hand on my wing. He said the Brethren needed to prove beyond a doubt that Michael was a creation of the Institute \u2014 not an angel sent by God. A hoax.\nProve beyond a doubt. I knew then why the Brethren of Truth freed me from the Institute.\nSoon after that, Davis came to me, at night. Seeing him steal towards my bed \u2014 it had taken all these months to adjust to sleeping on feathers in a mattress, rather than my own wings spread over a metal floor \u2014 I remembered how, at the Institute, he had peered at me through the bars in awe before he found the presence of mind to blast the bolt and open the gate. He looked at me now with that same stricken look. I thought he had come to break me out again.\nBut then \u2014 he began to plead.\nProve it for us \u2014 Michael was created. You\u2019re the only one who can \u2014 you\u2019re like him. Your wings are almost done. Let us complete you.\nWhat he said next was so familiar, for a moment I thought I was back in my enclosure at the Institute: Let us take you up into the sky \u2014 and you fall to earth like Michael did.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhen I threw it at him, he made the same sound I heard beneath the buildings when he freed me from the Institute. After he fled my small white room, the cry kept going \u2014 because it was the same sound I was making, and made for a long time after that.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nLying strapped to an operating table under a gold lamp, Brethren physicians working over me, I knew at last I could not escape the purpose for which the Institute made me: descent. For the Glory, it would show that no man-made wings could carry a mere human to earth intact. Death would mean Michael was God\u2019s messenger, and the Glory coup sanctioned by Him as Michael claimed. My death would be the Glory\u2019s triumph.\nWe\u2019ve come to release you from this fate, Davis had said when he found me in my cage at the Institute.\nBut the Brethren never meant to free me.\nUnder the gold lamp, my wings completed but the rest of me broken, I saw for the first time that my given purpose has followed me just as wings follow both scented summer updrafts and chill blizzard winds burdened with snow. I cannot be freed from it, from these wings. If I survive the fall from the sky, I will promise victory for the Brethren \u2014 I will prove Michael a hoax and the Glory\u2019s claim to power a fraud.\nMy descent will determine who will rule in the Temple-Capitol.\nThis matters none to me \u2014 me, who will fall, alone.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAs the wind burns and rips me, I repeat my name to myself over and over. It is the name given me by the doctors in the Institute, the only parents I knew, in the only home I have ever had: Gabriel. My name that means anything, anything at all, except God is my strength.\n\u00a9 2005 Darja Malcolm-Clarke, all rights reserved\n\u2022","source":null,"source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/cDhWvKqVIspcigyczrtOqQZCKaQ.json"}

But this was a special case, and I needed every advantage I could get.\nEspecially given the timeline. I\u2019d been warned this room would lock down in two hours Three, at most. Still, I took a moment to scan the room, gathering and noting identities, on and offgrid. I wasn\u2019t interested in most of them \u2014 yet.\nI did know that I was definitely interested in the shining food on the table.\nNo one blinked an eye as I headed there and carefully loaded up my plate. After all, that\u2019s the known advantage to being fat \u2014 you could indulge, even if you\u2019d be paying for it later when your autosynthetic bill arrived. I went with the indulgence. I wasn\u2019t fat very often, and this spread had some delightful stuff I didn\u2019t usually see. I even nibbled a little as I scanned the room, seeking out my target. She wasn\u2019t hard to find.\nThe hard part was suppressing my smile. I had to stuff my mouth for a moment to hide it.\nMy research, and the rumors I\u2019d spread, had paid off. She\u2019d surrounded herself with the grotesques, those who designed and flaunted hideous looks, solely to discomfort others. (It was working, too; no computer or coding could hide the sick look on one grotesque\u2019s face.) I began to wonder if the heavy guise would be enough.\nI wobbled my plate. Tricky, but it can be done, if you\u2019re careful.\nThat wobble was enough. She gave me a slow nod. I could approach. She was expecting someone ordinary looking \u2014 spectacularly beautiful and rail thin with either perfectly clipped pecs or size F boobs wobbling over a thin waist. But a fat person \u2014\nA fat person wasn\u2019t a threat.\nI pulled out the dagger from under the food plate and threw it at the direct center of her chest.\nA flash. A zip sound.\nAnd her avatar was gone, as if it had never existed.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSomething about them unsettled me. For once thing, they had programmed themselves to look like \u2026 well, the pre-grid sort of ordinary, except that ongrid, that sort of look was extraordinary. Oh, I\u2019d seen people try very hard to look as \u201creal\u201d as possible, based on old pictures and videos lodged in various servers. But it wasn\u2019t normal. Certainly not for my clients, whose attempt at old normal seemed an overt attempt to fit in.\nAnything abnormal makes me nervous. I added a few more warning systems to my senses and set a code to investigate the full addresses of my clients. Normally, I don\u2019t care about off grid identities as long as I\u2019m paid. But something felt wrong about these two.\nAnd not just because they\u2019d asked me to call them Number One and Number Two.\n\u201cCan you codelock this room and check for worms?\u201d Number Two asked.\nOk. Something definitely felt wrong. The request wasn\u2019t unheard of, given my line of work. But then again, most of my clients weren\u2019t worried about getting caught. Most expected retaliation, although the secondary point of hiring me was to avoid that sort of thing \u2014 it wasn\u2019t easy to track them down, nor impossible. I pressed a set of buttons and ran a worm sweep.\n\u201cWe\u2019re sealed,\u201d I said. \u201cBut bear in mind, if we\u2019re in a sealed room for too long someone\u2019s bound to start getting curious. So.\u201d\nTheir avatars never blinked, never looked at each other, but I guessed that they were PMing each other like mad. You do this long enough and you get a sense of that.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be quick,\u201d said Number One, in a voice that she must have spent a million credits on: it throbbed in multiple frequencies and rang like chorded bells. If I\u2019d actually been there, I would have shivered. It was difficult to keep my own avatar still.\nNumber Two leaned forward. His voice had an electronic twang; I couldn\u2019t place the developer. \u201cWe want you to kill someone. Offgrid.\u201d\nI knew something was wrong about these two.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nEven if eating synthetics without the overlay of the grid was godawful.\nGoing offgrid was one thing. So was killing someone\u2019s avatar, for that matter. But killing someone offgrid?\nThat was murder, plain and simple. Thinking about it, even my avatar had trouble breathing.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cQuite a request,\u201d I managed, after a moment. \u201cLeading to the first question of why?\u201d\nNumber One nodded. \u201cHere\u2019s part one of the file on your target.\u201d A yellow circle flashed just in front of my avatar; I moved a hand out to touch it. \u201cTo summarize, she\u2019s been taking orders for avatar designs. All perfectly legal, except that she\u2019s figured out a way to tweak the code, so that her clients see one image and everyone else sees something completely different. Something hideous.\u201d\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s just a bad costume,\u201d said Number Two. \u201cBut other times \u2026 well, she\u2019s given avatars everything from blotched faces and weight gains to missing arms and legs to \u2026 well, monsters.\u201d\nI let my avatar hand touch the glowing file. A rapid succession of pictures flew at me. Images too strong for most people, and a few worse than I\u2019d ever seen.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s not the real problem,\u201d said Number One. \u201cThe real problem, as I said, her victims can\u2019t see what they look like to other people. They assume the reactions \u2014 and some of the reactions have been, well\u2026\u201d The avatar blinked at me. I was already looking at the digitized pictures of the reactions, the way some people had started pummeling and throwing things at some of the worst looking of the bunch. I felt ill again. You didn\u2019t physically feel damage when your avatar was injured. Physically.\n\u201cThe psychological reactions have been devastating,\u201d said Number Two. \u201cWe can credit her with at least twenty-four associated deaths. At least five of those deaths involved children under twelve.\u201d\nI winced. I\u2019m not the most moral person in the world, but \u2014\n\u201cOk. So. Target, deserving. Still. Why me?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you have killed off grid before,\u201d said Number Two coldly. \u201cIf only incidentally.\u201d\nI hated when people brought that up.\nWhen I started this business, grid assassination was no big deal. I\u2019d bump people off, and anywhere from two minutes to two weeks later they were back on, cheerful as always, no harm done. The only reason I still had a job was that I could guarantee accuracy and speed.\nNow the grid charged for replacement avatars. Charged a lot. If you didn\u2019t have much money offgrid \u2014 and, let\u2019s face it, most people didn\u2019t; ongrid time rarely translated into offgrid money.\nSome people could handle that. Some people couldn\u2019t.\nSo. Some of my targets had suicided. At least three that I knew of; maybe more that I didn\u2019t know of. Not entirely my fault, but \u2026 Come to think of it, that was an effective method of offgrid assassination. Why not use that?\nI asked.\n\u201cBecause she has enough money to return ongrid in minutes, a nearly infinite number of times. She\u2019s not only making money off her clients, but also off people who pay her to create these distorted avatars. As a sort of revenge. And that business pays very well.\u201d\nI could imagine. Some people took ongrid life very seriously.\n\u201cThat leaves one major problem,\u201d I noted. \u201cI\u2019m a cyber assassin. How do you plan on getting me weapons outside?\u201d\nWhat did offgrid people do for weapons? I\u2019d seen them shoot around grid corners and light up a thousand thousand sparks. But if my dim memory was correct, guns in real life were different. And I didn\u2019t know how to use them.\n\u201cYou can try strangulation, suffocation, poison,\u201d Number One said, ticking the options off her fingers, as if this added to the temptation. \u201cBe creative.\u201d\n\u201cIt might actually be easier,\u201d Number Two said. \u201cOffgrid, you don\u2019t have to stab people directly in the heart to kill them.\u201d\nThat was true. That ongrid protocol had been set up specifically to slow assassins like me; not everyone had the skills needed to stab anyone in the precise digitally-measured center of the heart. Most people missed by a little, and those few millimeters were enough to give the victim a chance.\nA chance that an offgrid person wouldn\u2019t have.\nOutside I really was flabby and fat. I didn\u2019t spend my off grid moments working out, and god knows my ongrid activities never created much of an adrenaline rush, or reason to move my real life muscles either. The same might be true of my target. I\u2019d heard that some people made a point of staying in shape off grid. How pointless.\n\u201cAnd if I\u2019m caught?\u201d\nNo blinks from the avatars. \u201cOffgridders won\u2019t notice another decaying corpse outside. There are so many they\u2019re used to the smell .\u201d\nA pleasant thought.\n\u201cYour fee will be substantial,\u201d said Number Two.\nThat was true. I would make sure of it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s your chance to be a hero,\u201d said Number One.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a hero. I\u2019m an assassin.\u201d\nNumber One\u2019s avatar stretched into the imitation of a smile. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the point of this world? To let you be both?\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI looked out at the hard rain.\nPeople used to have things called umbrellas, and I\u2019d never owned one. Some ongridders carried parasols as fashion statements. My choices were a torn plastic bag or a pillow.\nI sighed.\nI put on the one pair of shoes I owned (offgrid, those things were expensive) and gathered clothing and a few unappetizing tubes of synthetic food together, along with the pillow. How exactly I was would carry all these was another question. I frowned. People must have faced these problems pre-grid. They had \u2026\nThey had suitcases.\nI sighed again. I had to use the torn plastic bag.\nI found an old roll of tape, made quick repairs, and headed out. Rain or no rain, I wanted this over with quickly. I always wanted to be back on grid the instant I was off, but this time I was really itching for it.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nFinally, I arrived at the address.\nIt was a grid home, a building designed for pure gridders, with its complex system of tubes for delivering water, synthetics, energy and, of course, the grid. Everything near it seemed lifeless in comparison. I eyed it closely. Ongrid, a building like this could only be entered with a key code, or solving a puzzle, or allowing yourself to be seduced by one of the residents.\nOffgrid \u2014\nWell, it would probably be a lot less complicated. After all, pure gridders usually had nothing to steal, except virtual credits. These buildings had to be emergency services accessible; eventually something went wrong with a power supply, or a synthetic feeding tube.\nSure enough, some exploration brought me to an unlocked maintenance door. Part one accomplished.\nPart two: finding her specific room.\nIf necessary, I could glimpse ongrid to check her address. I didn\u2019t want to risk that; coming on-grid only part way could attract trouble. I shut my eyes and tried to picture the grid, and the addresses, and\u2026\nNo good. I would have to check each room.\nGod, my feet.\nOn the bright side, no one locked their doors. Room after room, I checked face after face. None of them matched the clients\u2019 photo. Another room, then another. My feet would never be the same. Another room, another, more doors, and oh, my feet ached.\nA locked door.\nWho had a reason to lock doors, here?\nI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d need the image.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nInside, the room was \u2026 honestly, I\u2019d never seen anything like it. Ongrid things simply can\u2019t accumulate like that \u2014 the grid sets up autostorage \u2014 and offgrid I didn\u2019t know anyone who bothered to accumulate, well, anything other than the necessities. My target had. Things were piled up everywhere, making it difficult to move. A grim layer covered everything and it was hard to remember the word. When had cleaning bots last been there?\nHad they ever been there?\nSince she was accumulating stuff, and given her supposed wealth, what was she doing in a place like this? Instead of a decent apartment with full grid access?\nBecause she expects her avatar to be assassinated, I thought. She knew people were after her; had to have known the threat since the beginning. And although she had plenty of money, if she kept losing avatars every few hours\u2026\nNot even the largest fortune in the world could keep that up, whatever my clients thought.\nI stepped through the clutter maze as carefully as possible, searching for my target. Finally, among the boxes, furniture and wires, there was a buried bed, covered in wires and tubes and a grey blanket. I moved closer. Yes, the face matched the one on the file. I wondered how Numbers One and Two had secured that image, but I was better off not knowing.\nHer eyes were shut, her breathing even. She hadn\u2019t heard me batter down the door. I raised the pillow, the images of her victims flooded my mind. All I had to do was hold the pillow against her face, as her mind continued to explore the grid. She might not even notice. No one would notice until her avatar flashed out.\nI wanted to.\nBut I couldn\u2019t.\nI sighed, and started the emergency protocols for taking her offgrid.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nShe emerged quickly and clear. She looked at me steadily.\nShe knows, I thought. She knows.\nHer face betrayed her. She\u2019d spent too much time ongrid to know how to hide her emotions.\nIt wasn\u2019t a verbal admission of guilt, but it was enough.\n\u201cWhy take me off?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt would have been simpler.\u201d Her unused voice was rough, ragged and dry.\n\u201cBecause I couldn\u2019t kill you while you\u2026\u201d I couldn\u2019t think of the word. Asleep? Helpless? My voice wasn\u2019t in much better shape than hers. I made a note to practice talking offgrid.\nShe nodded, smiling a little, as if her mouth had forgotten how to.\nSomehow, that wasn\u2019t enough either. \u201cWhy?\u201d I managed. I knew why I did what I did: it was the only skill I had ongrid, the only way I could earn the credits I needed to survive. But, double-coding avatars \u2014\n\u201cIn Sanctuary, I was beautiful.\u201d\nGod.\nSanctuary was a problem. A way to perpetuate the species, but a problem. Originally an ongridders idea, for those who spent so much time ongrid that it affected the reproductive process. Ongrid sex was richer, deeper, and more satisfying than what had been the real thing. They gathered money to grow children in test tubes and incubators, from donor eggs and sperm of dazed gridders. The Sanctuary raised the kids. For the propagation of the species. At a given age \u2014 an official secret \u2014 they could chose: ongrid or off.\nMost everyone ongrid had come from the Sanctuary. They tended to be\u2026 problematic.\n\u201cAnd I was the only one. The only beautiful one,\u201d she said. \u201cUntil I got ongrid.\u201d\nAnd found herself just one of a million million spectacular beauties, limited only by their imaginations \u2014 or what they could pay for the imaginations of others. For the second time today, I winced.\n\u201cI tried about a hundred avatars, if you can believe it, before I started this.\u201d\nI could believe it. I\u2019ve known Sanctuary people to shed avatars every two hours, regardless of the expense. Not for the first time, I found myself thankful for my parents. They hadn\u2019t left me much money, but they at least hadn\u2019t left me in Sanctuary.\nI looked at her, trying to figure out why my stomach was roiling. I was going to kill her in a few moments, but besides that. And then it occurred to me. It was all so damn, well, clich\u00e9d. As if she was playing out a storyline. Which she was, except that she was playing it out with the real emotions of unreal avatars. Another clich\u00e9 right there.\nThe grid was for imagination. Fantasy. Spectacle. But clich\u00e9s?\n\u201cYou could have joined the offgridders,\u201d I suggested.\n\u201cThem?\u201d She couldn\u2019t have coded such scorn ongrid. \u201cA dying group. They only survive because we\u2019re still paying them to feed us.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got enclaves, outside the cities \u2014 \u201c I didn\u2019t know. It was a myth. But I guess I wanted to believe it.\n\u201cDon\u2019t kid yourself.\u201d\nShe hadn\u2019t taken her eyes off me, but she kept blinking, irregularly. It was disconcerting, after watching the time-measured blinks of ongrid avatars. I hadn\u2019t taken my eyes off her, either. My usual method wouldn\u2019t work. Not only had I not brought a dagger, but she\u2019d protected the direct center of her chest with some sort of metal mesh \u2014 I couldn\u2019t guess what that was, offgrid.\nThat\u2019s where we were, offgrid. But she hadn\u2019t protected her legs. Or her face.\nI moved as quickly as my aching, tired, flabby body would allow, grabbing her legs and slamming them with a piece of the broken door. She wasn\u2019t prepared for that, or the pain. I wondered when in her life she\u2019d hopped ongrid, if she\u2019d ever known real pain. I hit her legs a few more times. She tried to strike out, but her atrophied muscles were useless even against my amateur knots.\nThen I grabbed my pillow and pushed it into her face.\nIt takes a long, long time, for someone to die offgrid. I wasn\u2019t expecting that, or the sudden gagging smell as other parts of her body reacted.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBut even there, in all its wild beauty, I felt my fingers twitch, felt the dead body beneath my hands. Even out there the grid is only the grid. But I still need money, and every time I aim a cyberdagger or gun at a target, I smell that awful scent again, and quiver, even as my avatar remains perfectly still. And deadly.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue26\/3lbe26_story3.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"I would be fat for three more hours.

He\u2019s fishing the bow rod.\n\u201cI\u2019ll fish suspended,\u201d I say. I lower my bait to twenty-five feet on the line counter. Chinook typically lurk along the river bottom, cruising deep channels on their homeward ascent, but we\u2019ve caught some bruiser Chinook suspended this season.\nA sea lion surfaces behind us. I consider the paintball gun I have on board, but we\u2019re only allowed to shoot at them if they harass us. Yesterday, a sea lion grabbed George\u2019s first fish as I went to net it. Line screamed off the reel as the sea lion sped west toward the open sea. I hit the throttle and chased down the beguiling pinniped, but in the end, George reeled in the severed head of a salmon. George shoved a wooden hand into the fish head and moved its jaws to imitate speech. He made the fish head say filthy things. Owing to George\u2019s unique status as a sentient life form, he displays a particular interest in reproduction and mating rituals. Sometimes, late at night, he stalks into my room and slips into bed with me. I am awoken by a fumbling, awkward hand fondling me down there. He strokes me into hardness and pumps until I ejaculate in his hand. We\u2019ve never spoken about these encounters or what it means to either of us. The most unsettling part is that as he\u2019s spooning me, I can feel no breath upon my back, for George requires no oxygen. Soon after, he leaves as silently as he arrives. I am left alone, sticky and feeling slightly sickened by our enterprise.\n\u201cFish on!\u201d George says.\nHis rod buries, tip bent in the water. He rips the rod out of the holder with expert reflexes and reels down on the fish. I bring up my gear to give him more room for the fight. Despite his incessant reeling, the fish continues taking out line. I watch the line counter on George\u2019s reel climb. 60, 70, 80, 90, then the fish screams out to 120, 150 feet. When it\u2019s out 200 feet and still gaining on George, I realize he may have the Chinook of a lifetime \u2014 or at least the season \u2014 on the other end. We\u2019ll have to chase this one down.\nI throttle the motor. We\u2019re speeding downriver in pursuit of the great fish. George gains line now, keeping pressure on the fish so that it cannot spit the hook. George has been silent and focused since his initial declaration of connection with the deep. Some anglers are braggarts. They forget that fishing is person versus nature, person versus self, and not person versus person. We\u2019ll celebrate the bloodbath, but if our souls do not learn tranquility on the journey there, then what good have we done ourselves? George does not have a soul and even he knows this. It is why I choose to fish with him over others.\n\u201cIt\u2019s giving in,\u201d George says, finally.\nI grab the net, stand poised beside George. The line counter reads 20, 15, 10. The flasher rises up, spinning wildly. We get the first glimpse of the fish. Only, instead of the blinding silver flash of a salmon\u2019s side, what we see is gray and white and five feet long. The creature makes another run away from the boat.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sturgeon,\u201d I say.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fighting like a sturgeon,\u201d George says.\nI consider what else it might be. Piscine diversity in the Columbia River estuary is limited by extreme tides and fluctuations of saltwater and freshwater. Blue sharks and dogfish used to be common down here, but I\u2019ve seen little of either in recent years. Besides, neither puts up such a fight.\nA sea lions rears its head at the bow of the boat. Our curiosity turns to urgency. George bears down on the mysterious fish. He cranks down, lifts the rod, cranks, lifts. He mutters under his breath, but I miss the exact words. I get the sense he\u2019s pleading with the fish. That\u2019s a strange thing that happens when you find yourself doing battle with a great fish. You fall under the delusion that you and the fish are on the same team, pursuing a common goal, even though it is life or death for only one of you.\nThe fish heads straight for the boat now, likely because the sea lion is in hot pursuit. I\u2019ll have one shot to net George\u2019s fish. I cannot fail.\nThe flasher rises and George lifts the rod. The creature, whatever it is, surfaces. I move quickly, netting it and hauling it into the boat, acting on muscle memory. The sea lions pops up beside the boat and offers a disapproving bark before swimming off to harass someone else. I look to admire George\u2019s catch. He\u2019s already on his hands and knees beside it.\n\u201cMy love, my love,\u201d he whispers.\nAt first I believe he\u2019s speaking to me, grateful for my clutch net job, but then I process what I\u2019m seeing. George\u2019s extraordinary catch is not a fish at all. In the net lies a ventriloquist dummy \u2014 like himself.\nA tiny crab crawls from the dummy\u2019s mouth. George plucks the crab from her lips and tosses it overboard. The dummy wears a white wedding dress.\n\u201cIs she dead?\u201d I ask, realizing too late how dumb my question sounds. She was never living in the sense that I am living.\nGeorge works the set of hooks free from her wooden lips. Strangely, there is blood. George does not bleed but she does. He untangles her from the net and cradles her unmoving, wooden body in his arms.\n\u201cThis is what you humans call fate,\u201d George says.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in fate,\u201d I tell him.\n\u201cNeither do I, but here is fate nonetheless.\u201d\nFor no reason at all, I feel sick with jealousy. I\u2019m overcome with the desire to return this other dummy to the river, but I fear what George might think if I suggest such a thing. He\u2019s in control here.\nThe new dummy\u2019s skin \u2014 if that\u2019s what you call it \u2014 is dark like cherrywood. Her lips are red and look truly soft. Whereas George\u2019s hair is wood like all the rest of him, she has flowing blonde hair, which appears almost white in contrast to her darkly reddish skin. And it must be skin, for how else could she be so beautiful?\n\u201cHead to the marina,\u201d George says. \u201cI can bring her back.\u201d\n\u201cBack from where?\u201d\nGeorge shakes his head as if I could never possibly understand, even though I created him and we are, in a sense, lovers.\nOn the four-mile boat ride back to the marina, I find myself paying not enough attention to the river as I should. I can\u2019t take my eyes off this beautiful woman \u2014 and that\u2019s what she is. I wonder about George and his intentions. He\u2019s my best and only friend. Will he leave me for her? I would set him on fire if he tried.\nI\u2019m staring down the barrel of forever and whatever it takes, I want to live by her side. Even if she never speaks, I\u2019ll be happy with her silence.\nI guess this is what you call falling in love.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI wanted to be eternal, consumed by death, but not vampiric. I guess if I\u2019d told people that I wanted to be a salmon, rather than telling them I wanted to be dead, I probably could have avoided all of those school counseling sessions. So much for being painfully honest.\nI never really grew out of these early beliefs, which might explain why I\u2019ve never experienced a lasting or meaningful relationship with another human. This, I suppose, was my motivation for creating George. I desired the companionship of a more perfect life form. Awake in a perpetual state of lifelessness. Everything has been wonderful since George entered my life. I am mentally sound and emotionally well.\nNow I\u2019m in the driveway, cleaning the boat and dreaming of our next adventure. I work restlessly. George requested that I remain outside until after he completed a medical examination of our new companion. George is no more a medical doctor than I am the emperor of Mars. His nighttime visitations haunt me as I wash the boat. I imagine what terrible things he might be doing to my love. For the first time in our brief life together, I do not trust George. Up until now, I believed his wooden dummy skull held no capacity for evil. I believed his wooden heart to be pure and good. Why must George be alone with her? Are they sharing private puppet thoughts? She\u2019s beyond animation, for all we know. I cannot stifle the feeling that George is up to something awful, but my paranoia over the intentions of my best and only friend make me feel doubly awful. No, George is good. These suspicions I have about him are human thoughts. Human thoughts are bad. I must erase these bad thoughts. I must never think bad thoughts again. The act of smiling can make you happy even when you feel like scum, so I smile as I toss a tray of brined herring in the trash. Better to use fresh bait. Otherwise just stay home. I\u2019ll call Tackle Time and pick up another couple dozen herring in the morning.\nGeorge is suddenly behind me. I did not even hear him open the door. \u201cJenny is ready to meet you,\u201d he says.\nI\u2019m a little miffed that George named her without me, but maybe she came with a name.\nWith haste, I stow away the rest of the day\u2019s fishing gear, take off my boots, and step inside. George is in the kitchen, pouring hot water from the kettle into a teapot. \u201cWould you like some tea?\u201d he asks.\nHe should know the answer by now. I interpret his question as an act of passive aggression and get a beer from the fridge in response. The act of creating George was not at all like programming a computer. He will always remain an autonomous entity. He has no need to eat for subsistence, but early on in his existence as a life form, he developed a taste for hot tea. I think he got his first taste of it when I took him to the Saturday arts walk, a huge mistake I will never repeat. Too many people wandering the streets and galleries mistook him for a work of art and variously endeavored to purchase him or fuck with him. Anyway, the dummy loves tea. I\u2019m not happy about it, but then again, when am I ever truly happy?\nSometimes, when death seems so appealing, I consider all the things I would miss six feet down. Every day on the water, every day with George, is worth living for. Now there\u2019s Jenny.\nOut of nervousness I\u2019ve already downed my beer. I get another. This is my favorite beer. It\u2019s called The Optimist. I like to believe it brightens my disposition.\n\u201cLet me introduce you,\u201d George says, carrying two cups of tea into the living room. I follow him like a patient being led from the waiting room to the operating theater, but in this case I\u2019m only likely to be flayed apart by love. Do I love her? I don\u2019t even know her. Regardless, I\u2019m about to find out.\nGeorge hands a teacup to Jenny, who sits on the couch. She accepts the tea with a bow. George takes a seat beside her, leaving me to awkwardly stand or choose to sit on the floor. I choose to stand.\n\u201cThis is Jenny,\u201d George says.\n\u201cPleased to meet you,\u201d I say.\nJenny looks right at me. Her eyes \u2014 beautiful eyes \u2014 are the deepest shade of green I\u2019ve seen outside the best steelhead rivers in the most perfect conditions. She looks at me a little longer than is comfortable. I get the sense that she likes what she sees. Then I worry otherwise. What if she\u2019s appalled by me, all flesh and sweat, standing before her like a goon, in such contrast to the carved perfection that she and George share? I sit, feeling exposed by her gaze. She hasn\u2019t spoken a word and already I want to marry her.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Jenny,\u201d I say.\n\u201cAnd a pleasure meeting you as well,\u201d she says.\nMy heart flutters. \u201cWill you be staying with us long?\u201d\nShe looks askance at George, as if she\u2019s afraid to answer without his permission, or at least that\u2019s the impression that I get.\n\u201cI\u2019ve invited Jenny to live here,\u201d George says.\nI\u2019m thrilled by the news, and yet another part of me is bothered that he would extend an invitation to live in my house without my express permission. George and I have trust issues rooted in my instability, his otherness, and probably, his nighttime visitations to my bedroom. I\u2019m not that lonely. I just want people over for a barbecue every once in a while. Like come on, who doesn\u2019t like pork chops?\nGod, I\u2019m so in love. I\u2019m a bloody mess. The living room may as well be on the moon. Jenny may as well be Jupiter. What is George to her? What am I?\nThere are rare occasions where I feel life, in all its suffering, might be worth living. This, despite all its confusion, is one of those occasions. I want to know what happens next. I want to live.\nI decide to be terribly frank. I straight up ask, \u201cHow do we proceed from here?\u201d\n\u201cDo you mean us or you?\u201d George says, more telling than asking.\n\u201cYou\u2019re my best friend, George. I want to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business.\u201d\n\u201cI invented you.\u201d I instantly regret saying it. George and I never openly speak of his origins. \u201cI\u2019m tired. I\u2019m going to take a nap.\u201d\nI retreat to my bedroom, strip out of my fishy clothes, and collapse in a heap on the bed. I immediately pass into a deep sleep. I fall into dreams of a sexual nature, unusual for me. I dream that I\u2019m doing Jenny from behind, but her butt is a shark and she\u2019s eating me alive. My dream self is bleeding to death and loving it. And when I ejaculate, I ejaculate blood. The shark morphs into a coffin and traps me inside. The shark is a symbol of my fatal attraction to a woman I cannot live beside.\nThere\u2019s a knock on my door. I stir and grumble, \u201cCome in.\u201d\nThe door opens slowly. George steps inside. \u201cWe\u2019re going out.\u201d\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\n\u201cBowling.\u201d\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t drive, George.\u201d\n\u201cWe can walk.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have any money.\u201d\n\u201cI was hoping we could borrow some.\u201d\n\u201cGeorge, come here a minute.\u201d\nHe hesitates in the doorway, then approaches me and sits on the foot of the bed.\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says, \u201cI haven\u2019t been exactly clear.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t. And you\u2019ve been a fucking dick.\u201d\n\u201cI wanted to wait awhile before telling you the truth.\u201d\n\u201cThe truth about what?\u201d\n\u201cDo you believe, against all odds, that ours was the boat to reel in Jenny today?\u201d\n\u201cIncredible things happen on the water all the time.\u201d\nHe looks at me as if I\u2019m daft.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d\n\u201cYour faith in the impossible is indicative of a deeper psychosis or a loneliness so extreme it\u2019s incredible you haven\u2019t died from it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with Jenny? How come I can\u2019t love her?\u201d\n\u201cOh god.\u201d George buries his face in his hands. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve already fallen in love. How is that possible?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m crazy, remember?\u201d\n\u201cYou lonely son of a bitch.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you were my friend.\u201d\n\u201cI am.\u201d\n\u201cFriends support one another.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s things about me you don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cI created you.\u201d\n\u201cI hoped to prolong this conversation another year or more.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou did not create me. I am not of this planet. Nor is Jenny. We are two of many. Soon our kind will populate in greater numbers. We will replace you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. I am a great inventor. I invented you.\u201d\n\u201cYou are a man with an undocumented history of mental illness, but you\u2019ve succeeded in living a normal life just outside the reach of others. You were the perfect companion for my integration into society.\u201d\nThe sea lions bark down on the riverfront. We can hear them way up here on the hill.\n\u201cSo what happens now?\u201d\n\u201cYou die,\u201d George says, \u201cand then the whole human race dies.\u201d\nAnd in this moment fraught with tension, sitting on my bed, holding hands with George, I realize I no longer have a single goddamn friend in the universe. I am alone except for the love and pain I carry in my pocket.\nJenny appears in the doorway, smiling her vacant puppet smile. Then she\u2019s coming at me with a fillet knife. Even then, I think that maybe I can trust her.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue30\/3lbe30_story3.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"We launch out of the West End Marina in the pre-dawn fog, navigating the treacherous sands to the Washington side of the river.

Nothing much, only a pleasant dim bedroom (not his own bedroom, not any room he had ever inhabited), the colors burnt sienna with a little rose. Reddish like a bright light glowing through fingers. It felt like an eternal afternoon through that eye, the drapes closed with sunlight behind them. A blurry, underwater feeling.\nCharles had a dominant nose, and maybe that was what focused him on that particular spot in his field of vision. He\u2019d be in a class \u2014 or later at work in the Department of Mathematics\u2019 main office, making copies, filling out spreadsheets \u2014 and the blur of the right side of his nose would distract him and he would focus there thinking his own thoughts rather than whatever thoughts he was supposed to be thinking. Seeing just the warm ruddy spot of color that was his nose and then, as things progressed, he saw more.\nDottie was tied up with these sights from the first time he saw her. Overfriendly Dottie always smelling of the cinnamon Altoids she used to cover the desperate parking-lot cigarettes she thought she was keeping secret. Dottie who seemed to live in her little office across the hall. She was always there when Charles came in at seven-thirty and had never left before him, not once.\nSometimes Charles would sit at his desk thinking of Dottie, his two eyes on his email, fingers moving over keys, and that other eye would open.\nThe drapes in the bedroom of the other place glowed red as everything else that was seen through that particular eye. They were made of tapestry or jacquard, thick but not entirely opaque. He could just make out something of the design and something of the stubbled texture.\nThe plain office decor around him had often soothed him (Charles hated clutter), but now, set against the warm bedroom, it felt overly cool and stark.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nShe didn\u2019t work for Math at all; she worked for the tutoring center located on the next floor, but the tutoring staff had overflowed their office space, and because her work was somewhat more independent than that of the other staff, she\u2019d been given that one forgotten office set off by itself across the hall from Math. That space in the hall had become for all that Fall term a popular place for people to linger.\nDottie had come to the college from far away and made a good first impression. Cheerful, genuine-seeming, she was the kind of person who carried all her weight in the middle and tapered toward all her ends. Tiny ankles and feet, tiny pretty hands, a doll-like face and glossy russet hair. Immaculately put together, too, and in the first months she\u2019d smelled of a subtle department store scent rather than cinnamon and smoke.\nYes, she had been popular during that first term. Young women from the Registrar\u2019s office came to take her to lunch off campus, and there were young men lingering in her doorway, too, from time to time. At evening events, such as lectures and film screenings, someone was always calling her over to sit. Charles saw because he attended many of those events, too. He sat alone most times, though if anyone from Math was there, they would wave him over and offer a dry smile.\nDottie didn\u2019t stay popular for long. Charles could have guessed she wouldn\u2019t even if he hadn\u2019t been at that dinner event, though that illustrated the matter quite well. She sat at the table closest to the speaker, Charles at the next table back. She was the freshest-looking person in the room, surrounded by silvery professors and grayed-out staff. Charles watched her speaking; he didn\u2019t need to hear. She had some affinity for the subject they were discussing, and she spoke on it with passion, not for a long time but long enough that two of the others at the table shared a look. She really did seem inspired, like she might strike out or cry. She caught herself, blushed vibrantly, fell quiet. Talk at the table went on, and she joined in but only with little bursts of agreement after that.\nAnd Charles caught a \u201chelp-me\u201d look from a student one time when Dottie was talking in a group in the hallway. On his way out one evening, he caught another little something. The hall lights were off, and she must have thought that everyone had gone home.\nShe spoke to someone on the phone (ninety-nine percent chance it was to her far-away mother): \u201cI try. I know. I will. It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d\nCharles watched her even more closely after that. He felt he could work out the story she told herself: She didn\u2019t fit in here after all. These dried-up gray people were wearing her down, everyone around her seemed dead inside. She was most happy when she was passionate and loud and they wished her quiet. She\u2019d gone to some trouble to become this vivacious thing, and here they were driving her back into her shell.\nWhenever Charles thought of Dottie, his small eye tended to open up to its warm red vision. It wasn\u2019t just at the office anymore. He couldn\u2019t keep his thoughts on movies or television, let alone games, let alone reading. At times he\u2019d do some dumb thing with his hands \u2014 polishing knives, scrubbing pots. He\u2019d look out his kitchenette\u2019s window, look out to the parking lots and think of Dottie. Sometimes he dried his hands, sat at his little table and doodled while thinking of her, and when he thought to look down at the pad, he saw surprising things drawn there. A pair of wire-framed glasses lying on a nightstand, an old-fashioned wind-up alarm clock.\nThe glasses he\u2019d drawn in brick-colored pencil had a regular lens on the left, and on the right was an almost-regular lens with another smaller lens set in near the nosepiece. Glasses for a person with two regular eyes and a third, smaller one near the nose.\nIn that other place, he sat up slowly and turned to the window. Up close, the drapes smelled acrid, smoky and metallic. Something else, too, but he couldn\u2019t catch it. He couldn\u2019t stay long, couldn\u2019t ever seem to keep that small eye open.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nShe stared up at him, her mouth slightly open. She\u2019d just been bent over plugging or unplugging something.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201d He stepped back. He was very aware of his own face just then and set an appealing expression on it. Masculine shyness, soft interest.\n\u201cI\u2019m just killing time before class,\u201d Dottie said. Suddenly she was that old Dottie from a few months before, all open and genuine-seeming.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were a student,\u201d he said\n\u201cA night class, for fun.\u201d\n\u201cAh, but that doesn\u2019t explain why you\u2019re here so late the rest of the week.\u201d\nThey laughed nervously and Charles said he liked her wall-hanging, her peach-gold salt lamp (And didn\u2019t her things recall that place? Didn\u2019t they seem allusions to it?). The whole exchange was two or three minutes, but it made him feel triumphant all the way downstairs, all the way to his car.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThey didn\u2019t kiss until after the winter break when she returned from her mother\u2019s. They were chaste for people their age, but eventually they were sharing a bed one or two nights each week. Always her bed, as his poor bare apartment was unfit for any kind of romance.\nHer apartment was as red and pink and peach as he\u2019d expected, but it was also surprisingly spacious and plush. Charles appreciated the cleanness and the quality of all that was on display, and yet it was overcrowded for his taste. After an hour or two, the lamps and plants and gewgaws began to feel overwhelming. He would close his eyes, the other eye would open in the other place, and he would shock himself out of it, stand and try to occupy himself or start a conversation, anything to stay in the real world until it was time for dinner or bed or whatever they were doing.\nWhen he was sleeping over, he\u2019d spoon her until she slept and then loosen the hold. He\u2019d let himself slip into that other place.\nIt was bittersweet now because he knew it wasn\u2019t thinking of Dottie that took him there. He was moving away from her to visit that place where she could not follow. It was something about lovemaking, or the way her apartment made him feel, or her scents of smoke and then shower, perfume and then smoke and then cinnamon. She had him smoking sometimes and drinking more than he was accustomed to doing, so maybe that was also part of it. A rise in blood pressure or something. He\u2019d loosen his hold on her, push his face into the pillow, his heart going harder than it should, and the small eye would open right away.\nHe saw everything now, from the paisley pattern in the curtains to the pale enamel on the old-fashioned alarm clock. He touched the glasses, brought them to his face. They had those deep-curved wire earpieces that hold tight. He saw the brass footboard and beyond its bars a trunk with a striped blanket folded upon it. He saw beyond that to a small fireplace with a wood-framed mirror hanging above it. He wanted very badly to go to that mirror.\nIn that place, he always meant to rise and sweep the drapes open and look in the mirror, and he very often could rise, but he could take no more than a half-step in either direction before that little eye would slam closed, cutting him entirely out of the scene.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDottie saw things differently. She was back to something of what she had been, on the surface at least. Keeping the secret of their relationship, which she approached as a kind of game, made her vivacious again. New young women came around to take her off campus for lunch. There were always more people to meet.\nAs the Spring semester went on and the days grew longer, it seemed they spent more time talking. Dottie said more than Charles did. She spoke passionately, just as she had on that long-ago day when he noticed her at the dinner. Charles never wanted to escape her. Sometimes when she talked about people they knew she was surprisingly cruel, and that gave him a little thrill, brought him ever closer to her. She had so many opinions, so many interests, so much derision and even hatred for the people around them. She unfolded like a flower, revealing layer after layer like an onion.\nCharles tried to make his face appealing while she spoke. He stared at the right side of his nose and fell to looking down at the rosy floor in that other place, but when she was awake, she always called him back. She\u2019d ask him a question, and, surprising himself, he\u2019d answer it honestly.\nShe wanted participation, and so he obliged. He told her how he and she were alike. He didn\u2019t have interests, opinions \u2014 that wasn\u2019t what he meant. It was deeper than that. It was the way they didn\u2019t fit in and had always been alone, even in a crowd. He told her stories from his life to illustrate.\nWith a meaningful look, he finally told her it was all tied up with that other place they both went to sometimes. He referred to the other place casually, as though it were only a metaphor.\nSomething softened in Charles as they spoke of these things, and when they went to bed they were both gentler and more impassioned than they had been before. He said, \u201cI love you\u201d for the first time and she said it back soft and slow. They didn\u2019t try to spoon because the room was overheated. They lay on their backs breathing deeply, all drenched in opioid feelings.\nCharles closed his eyes, and he didn\u2019t have to try; when his small eye opened in that other place, he put on the special trifocal glasses, rose and glanced at the mirror so quickly he could not comprehend the strange image there. He turned to the drapes\u2014\n\u2014and that was it. The small eye slammed shut.\nAfter a while, he slept and woke to a room even hotter than before. Light came from the bathroom, a tinkling sound.\nCharles closed his eyes, the small eye opened, he put on the glasses and rose and took a long look in the mirror this time. The face was his own face only thin and old. The small eye blinked out of time with the others. Concentrating more than he\u2019d thought he could, Charles turned to the line where the two drapes met and pushed them back.\nThe scene before him was red, bright and strange, incomprehensible really. It reminded him of coral, of frilly mushrooms, but it wasn\u2019t either. He caught a hint of something (worm-arm?) and the eye slammed shut.\nDottie walked by the bed to the window. \u201cToo hot,\u201d she said. She pushed up the old wooden window with some effort. A warm gust came through the room.\nCharles was already back in that other bedroom, and this time he was still standing, still walking. He moved around the bed, between the trunk and the fireplace. The paisley drapes had fallen closed. The far side of the room was in dark red shadow.\nIn the depths of the shadow, he could just make out two doors.\n\u201cYou want a cool shower?\u201d Dottie said. She\u2019d already thrown off her little nightie.\nCharles rose and followed her to the bathroom. He was in both places.\nHe was not coming in or out but remained in the two places! He\u2019d have liked to say something about it to Dottie, but he was too overcome.\nIn the other place, Charles opened the door to a bathroom laid out like Dottie\u2019s but with a clawfoot tub, no showerhead at all. Maybe showers had never been invented in that other place.\nDottie stood in her tub, waiting for him to get in. He knelt and put the plug in, started the water.\n\u201cYou want to take a bath?\u201d she said, sitting down. Her voice came clear and close, but in that other place her voice was far away. It seemed far beneath the floor.\nHe knelt beside the tub while the water poured in.\nHe saw \u2014 in both places, he saw \u2014 the water was filling. The strangest thing: in the other place, the bottom of Dottie was there in the tub. Her heels, her calves, her thighs and butt stuck up out of the water, all flattened as though a length of heavy glass pressed down on them. Just an absent pink span of flesh, yet he knew it must be her.\nHere in her own dim gold-colored bathroom, Dottie smiled at him, pulled his arm. \u201cGet in,\u201d she said. She pushed herself back to make more room, and he moved in, kneeling in the cool deep water between the faucet and her body\nIn that other place, he knelt in exactly the same place. Her upside-down feet pushed back toward her upside-down butt. She was coming into that space with him. Like being born breach. He grasped her ankles and tried to pull from that side, but nothing happened; she was stuck and did not move.\nHe would have to try pushing from this side instead.\nHe placed his hands on her shoulders and pressed \u2014 not too hard, not violently. He pressed from this side, and in that other place her cubelike body came up another inch. It stopped.\n\u201cWhat are you up to? Want to rub my back?\u201d she said.\nCharles nodded, and there was an awkward rearrangement, her body going so strange in that other place. Once seated behind her, he pressed again on her back. It had no effect.\n\u201cThat feels good,\u201d she said. \u201cGo lower.\u201d\nHe did. The little eye remained open seeing the bottom of her, but here on this side, he rubbed her back just like a normal person with no motive except to give pleasure. After a while, he poured shower gel on a pouf and washed her back. He washed her front as far as he could and she took the pouf to finish.\nShe looked back at him so happy, like all her life and energy had come back stronger. \u201cI love you,\u201d she said, a euphoric feeling coming off of her. On the other side, she lay before him like a grotesque rose. I have to push harder, he thought, but what if\u2026\n\u201cCan\u2019t you come over by yourself?\u201d he said softly.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d she said. She was sleepy again.\n\u201cOpen your other eye,\u201d he said.\nShe only giggled.\nA red-toned image of a violent push came to his mind \u2014 splashing gurgling fear and horror, her nails raking his arms and chest \u2014 but he pushed that image away. She pushed back against him and turned on more cool water with her foot.\nSomething had changed about his vision on Dottie\u2019s side. Perhaps his eyes had adjusted to the dim light. Her bathroom was no longer the calming gold color but jarred with blue and yellow-green and a great deal of staticky gray. He closed these eyes and opened the others wider.\nIn that other place, all was still red. He looked away from the terrible thing she was. The window called to him. Somewhere there was a door to the outside. He just had to find it.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll follow when you can,\u201d he said. On the one side, his body stayed behind her, just a flesh-chair for her to lean back against, but on the other side, he eased away from her and carefully stepped out of the tub. He knelt and pressed, gently, until all of her was gone, until nothing but clear water remained in the red-lit bathtub.\n\u201cAre you asleep?\u201d she said, but it was far away. He did not feel her turn and put a hand to his face.\nHe stood and found he did not need to dry himself. All was red, pleasingly warm but not hot. His element. He left the bathroom, hovering toward the enticing window.\nHe heard her screaming for a moment, but it was very, very far away.\n\u2022\nFront & Back cover art by Rew X\n\u2022\nJulie Ireland\nBear Weiter\nCraig Church\nKelly L.\nJessica Guptill\nThomas Ha\nMaria Haskins\nLorna D.

One in the morning \u2026 and one at night.\nStupid, impossible: Where\u2019s this coming from? Yet she finds she can\u2019t close her eyes against it, can\u2019t even shake her head; there\u2019s no dismissing \u2014 whatever it is. This struck bell. This resonance.\nSoon she\u2019s back in her apartment, the upper clasp-lock firmly seated, with both bags still moping in the kitchen. Tomorrow, she tells herself, she\u2019ll take them down to the corner and shove them through the slot for recycling, because it\u2019s bigger. They don\u2019t stink that much.\nBut her dreams smell of decay that night, and a tone runs underneath everything, a hiss. The dead-technology sense-memory of static on an empty channel.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nOne in the morning, the no-voice says from much closer, now \u2014 next to her ear or perhaps even inside it, its lack of breath tickling the drum. And one at night\u2026.\n(But it\u2019s not even afternoon, Alena thinks, ridiculously.)\nShe bolts the second the doors chunk open and makes the mail-room, then stuffs both bags down inside the flip-top bin meant for junk post. Let the cleaning staff deal with it; they\u2019ll be right not to thank her, but then again, they won\u2019t exactly know who to not thank, short of ripping them open and going through her egg- and coffee-saturated detritus.\nStairs back up again, two by two, pulling herself by the railing, fast as she can manage. Her heart hammering harder with every fresh step, until the spit in her mouth tastes like blood.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHalf a week running, she dreams that the apartment bathtub, hidden behind its opaque shower curtain, is occupied by something pitifully long and thin, its boneless arms crossed over a concave breast in some sort of parody of repose. Above, its head tips back, noseless, eyes rolled \u2019til only a feeble gleam of ball shows in the sockets\u2019 deep shadow.\nIt smiles at her when she draws the plastic back with shaking dream-hands, as though trying to prove itself no threat. Wet teeth in the dark, elongated from shrunken gums.\nShe wakes sweat-covered, chilled, praying to find herself alone. Thinks, without wanting to: One at night.\nMorning finds her elsewhere, roaming the streets outside, trying to outpace whatever the voice wants to show her, by the feeble breaking light of dawn.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cSomething wrong in the building,\u201d Alena tells her. \u201cThey\u2019ve had the water off, for \u2026 three days, almost.\u201d\nHer mother frowns. \u201cIs that legal?\u201d\n\u201cI think I\u2019d know by now, if it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\nHer mother talks some more at her, and Alena just nods her head, submissive. No point in arguing, especially when she can barely hear what she\u2019s saying.\nOne in the morning, and one at night. One in the morning, and one at night. One in the morning\u2026\nShe entertains brief fantasies of a world without either, perpetual twilight, infinite dusk. Thinks: This\u2019ll pass, it has to. I just \u2026 have to stop thinking. I have to stop thinking of these things. Get them out of me, someplace I can catch hold of them, like bugs. Crush them. Burn them. Wash them down the drain\u2026\nWriting them down doesn\u2019t seem to help, though, either. It only makes them more palpable, somehow \u2026 more definite. More real.\nMoving ever closer, unseen, unstoppable, no matter what she does, or doesn\u2019t do. One in the morning, always. And then, as day ticks away, eventually\u2026\n\u2026one at night.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDid she invite this? What brought it on? Was it something she did? Something she is?\nIs there nothing she can do? Nothing to stop doing?\n(Nothing, the voice repeats, from deep inside her own throat, setting her larynx vibrating with the tiniest possible hint of sympathy. Nothing, no. And, then\u2014)\n(something)\nSomething, always, at the corner of her eye, in the dark, in the light \u2014 fluttering, scratching, crawling. Something behind every door, around every corner.\nSo by the end, Alena finds herself alone in her room, crouching, unable to get comfortable. Too afraid to turn on the light, but too afraid to be in the dark; afraid to look, yet afraid to look away. Too afraid, as the old phrase goes, to either close her eyes, or open them.\nHands over both ears, fingers dug in deep, deaf to everything but the hiss of her own pulse, the shuddery thump of her heart. But hearing her own brain repeat, nevertheless \u2014 again and again, without pause \u2014\nOne in the morning.\nAnd one at night.\nOne in the morning.\nAnd one at night.\nOne\nand one\nOne\nand one\nand\none\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nTake it out, oh Christ.

Get a hold of yourself.\u201d\nPaul Townes was wearing Frank Lindy\u2019s red flannel bathrobe. It stank from Old Spice and mentholated arthritis cream. But Frank\u2019s familiar smell was a comfort. They'd been together for forty years. Friends, then more than friends, then friends again. They were professional jazz musicians. Paul the flamboyant trumpeter \u2014 was there any other kind? \u2014 and Frank the keyboardist. Well, they weren\u2019t musicians anymore. Now they were old men living a mile apart on a logging road in the cold north woods. Their properties backed up to a deep iced-over lake. Winter padlocked them in their cabins except when Paul put on his snowshoes and walked over to Frank\u2019s for a home-cooked meal, some twelve year-old Scotch, and the LPs playing on Frank\u2019s turntable.\nPaul had seen a dead man up at the Snowcatters\u2019 Club.\nHe was a half-frozen wreck when Frank heard him pounding on the door. Frank got Paul out of his wet clothes and put him in the shower. The water warmed him but it hadn\u2019t calmed him down. He stared out through a crack in the drapes. Snowdrifts rose like whale humps out of the gravel in Frank\u2019s driveway. The storm they'd predicted on the radio was hitting hard. White spun into more white.\n\u201cHere.\u201d Frank placed a tumbler of neat Scotch in Paul\u2019s trembling hands. \u201cI\u2019ve got a chicken pot pie in the oven. Will you please just sit down? I can\u2019t take your pacing. Besides, there\u2019s no room for it.\u201d Frank finger-combed Paul\u2019s long peppery hair away from his eyes. \u201cRelax, Dearie. There\u2019s nobody out there.\u201d\nPaul checked the window again.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t see anybody at the Snowcatters'. The road\u2019s gated. The wind chill is ten below. What you saw was probably\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAn Indian. I saw an Indian in the window where the bar sign used to hang.\u201d\n\u201cPaul, please.\u201d\n\u201cI know what I saw. And I may be a drunk, but I'm not a nutcase. So don\u2019t patronize me.\u201d\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s finish our Scotches, fill our bellies, and sit by the fire until this nasty weather passes.\u201d\nPaul didn\u2019t answer.\nFrank opened the fireplace grate and dropped a chunk of dry wood into the flames. When he glanced away from the fire, he saw Paul wedging a kitchen chair under the doorknob.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nFrank cleared the dishes and gave Paul a clamshell for his ashes. Paul had the bottle of single malt on the table. He refilled his own glass. The wind sounded like a grindstone against the roof. Frank\u2019s four-pronged cane thumped on the pine floor. He changed the record. Up came Chet Baker\u2019s brittle horn work on Playboys, a favorite of Paul's.\nPaul watched the knotholes in the pine paneling as if they were capable of looking back. His dripping snowshoes hung from a nail beside the blocked door. The room filled with cigarette smoke and the smell of wet wool as his pants and jacket dried near the fire. The booze settled his nerves a bit.\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t said why you were even up at the Snowcatters'. It\u2019s odd for you to wander so far with a storm brewing.\u201d\n\u201cI was in a walking mood. I didn\u2019t really set out for the club, but I wound up there.\u201d Paul crushed a cigarette, lit another with a stove match. \u201cYou know the club\u2019s roof caved in. I'd guess from the big snow on Tuesday.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a shame.\u201d\nPaul nodded. His hand rubbed circles on the tabletop. \u201cI pried a loose board away so I could see inside, get a look at the damage. I had my Coleman.\u201d Paul carried the lantern ever since he got lost in the woods last November. A cloud-bound sun had snuffed itself out while he tried to retrace his path. The watery gray light of the woods drained to purple, and from purple to perfect black. Paul panicked. He was lucky to stumble onto a main road. Truck lights. A snowplow picked him up.\nPaul wanted Frank to know he'd been careful this time. He felt compelled to explain the logic of his actions and the simple innocent curiosity. \u201cHis face just popped up behind the window. Blood running down his chin. He was chewing. And he looked goddamned pissed off to see me.\u201d\nFrank maneuvered himself into his recliner. He switched on his reading lamp though the cabin was bright from the fire and kitchen fluorescent bulb. He put on his glasses and pretended to read a water-damaged back issue of Down Beat.\n\u201cHe knows us,\u201d Paul said.\nFrank turned a rippled page.\n\u201cJohnson Free. That\u2019s who it was, you know, the Indian? Johnson Free.\u201d\nFrank peeked over the top of the magazine. \u201cJohnson Free is dead.\u201d\n\u201cDing, ding, ding\u2014 give the man a prize.\u201d Paul swallowed too much Scotch at once and went into a full-tilt coughing fit. By the time Frank got himself out the recliner, Paul was scarlet and waving him off. The fire snapped, and Frank jerked around to see if the door was opening. He rolled the Down Beat as if a spider needed killing.\nNever letting go of his cigarette, Paul dipped his head under the kitchen faucet and drank until he was quiet. His skin returned to its usual grayish yellow. He wiped his mouth with the robe sleeve.\n\u201cIt was Johnson, but his hair was grown out. Long, black\u2014 oh, you know what a goddamned Indian\u2019s hair looks like.\u201d\n\u201cDid he have a tomahawk?\u201d Frank said like he wanted it all to be a joke.\n\u201cGo to hell.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe lamp and kitchen light were still on. Sparks shot from the fireplace and landed, burning, on the stone hearth. Paul wondered if he'd thrown in too much wood before going to bed.\nGoddamn cold.\nHe kicked off the comforter, tucked the empty under his arm, and climbed down the ladder of stripped logs. He passed through the living room and crossed the invisible threshold dividing it from the kitchen. Except for the tiny loft bedroom and the bathroom, the A-frame cabin was an open plan.\nFrank slept on the sofa bed in the living room. Since his stroke he couldn\u2019t manage the ladder. Paul remembered chasing a younger Frank up the log contraption, the two of them bare-assed and eager. Hot August mornings thirty years ago. That sheen of sweat glowing on their pale skins.\nFor all those summers, Frank had kept a cooler stocked with Leinenkugel\u2019s next to the king-size bed. Paul guessed he had drunk a thousand cases from Frank\u2019s cooler over the years. Twenty-four thousand bottles of beer on the wall, if one of the bottles happens to fall\u2014 it would have fallen into his hands, no doubt.\nThe quintet traveled throughout the year, but they spent their summers playing exclusively for the members of the Snowcatters\u2019 Club. Rich men and their wives from the upper Midwest who vacationed in the Northwoods. The audience was always small, the room intimate, and the money good. Frank had gotten them the regular seasonal gig. He handled all the group\u2019s bookings.\nSo many moths would gather on the windshield during a Snowcatters\u2019 gig, they had to turn on their wipers before they could pull out of the club\u2019s lot. Frank\u2019s Ford had tunneled through the moonlit woods along strangled, twisty dirt roads. How they never wrapped around a tree was a mystery. Paul couldn\u2019t recall a single sober drive home from the club.\nReminiscing isn\u2019t your strong suit, Dearie, Frank often said.\nThe truth was many of Paul\u2019s memories weren\u2019t available to be treasured \u2014 sunken, as they happened to be, beneath an ocean of booze. But those late summer nights when the quintet played and the mornings after, when he and Frank crawled into bed together drunk and weary and alive\u2014 he could still taste the beer foam on his sore lips.\nPaul listened for the regular rasp of his friend\u2019s breathing. His knee bumped the edge of the foldout bed. Paul leaned over. Frank had his old army blanket pulled up to his ears.\nPaul didn\u2019t want to worry him. Frank needed his rest.\nBut Johnson Free was up at the club.\nPaul opened the cabinet over the sink for a new bottle. He cracked the seal, took a slug, and put the cap back on.\nWith the replacement fifth under his arm, Paul glided back toward the ladder thinking the wood floor felt smooth and chilly as a concrete slab even through Frank\u2019s thick hunting socks. He didn\u2019t need to lift his feet. Just push and slide, push and slide.\nA woman screaming for her life.\nHis first thought was it might be a trick of the wind.\nBut it continued. A muscle quivered in Paul\u2019s gut. Words shouted in the storm. The woman\u2019s scream broke apart like a hearty burst of laughter. Storm noises. Then she started again. Closer to Frank\u2019s cabin. She probably saw the light in the windows.\nPaul lunged for the kitchen switch and landed on his ass. The unbroken scotch bottle twirled like a bowling pin next to him.\nFrank struggled in his pillows to sit upright. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d\n\u201cMe, it\u2019s me. Take it easy, Frank. Stay in bed. It\u2019s Paul, okay?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you doing on the floor?\u201d\n\u201cI fell.\u201d\n\u201cOh, Christ \u2014\u201d\n\u201cI think I'm fine.\u201d\n\u201cIs that a person? Is somebody screaming out there?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWe have to call the police. Get the phone.\u201d\n\u201cNo one\u2019s going to come here in the storm. Not in time to save her from whatever\u2019s happening.\u201d Paul, on his knees, found the reading lamp and extinguished it.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Frank stuffed his numb leg into a pair of corduroys. \u201cWe have to try and help for God\u2019s sake.\u201d\nPaul killed the fluorescent. He flung open the cabinets and found a plastic lemonade pitcher. He filled it with tap water.\n\u201cAre we hiding? Is that what we\u2019re doing?\u201d Frank asked.\nPaul doused the fire. Blue steam poured into the room. Hiss and stink. Cinders floated in the puddle on the hearth. Paul had the poker. He stirred the mess he'd made.\nFrank shrugged into his ratty green cardigan. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost it, old pal. Completely lost your all-too-tenuous hold on reality.\u201d Three hard thumps of rubber hitting pine as Frank dragged himself to the window beside the door. He snapped on the floodlight.\n\u201cI see her. Do you hear me, Paul?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s she doing?\u201d\n\u201cLaying in the snow. She\u2019s got a snowsuit on. She\u2019s just some kid who\u2019s had a snowmobile accident. Now get out there and help her.\u201d\n\u201cYou go.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t walk in snow.\u201d Frank opened the door and the room was freezing, all the stored heat exhaled in a single breath.\nPaul raised the poker and refused to move from the hearth.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no fucking Indian out there.\u201d Frank stared at his former lover. Paul\u2019s aged body was bone-thin and stringy. A tuft of sad white hairs grew between his nipples. Frank watched him shiver. \u201cYou\u2019ll die of frostbite before Johnson Free ever eats you, because I'm not closing the door until you bring her in.\u201d\nFrank held the door and talked while Paul got dressed. \u201cI\u2019ll call for an ambulance. I'm sure you\u2019re right and they haven\u2019t plowed anything but the main roads. We\u2019ll have to do what we can for her until they\u2019re able to make it through. We\u2019ll build another fire.\u201d Frank felt a twinge of guilt, forcing Paul to go out when he was obviously terrified. Through the falling snow, Frank saw the girl rolling. \u201cI\u2019ll make us some toddies. At least we can warm her up.\u201d\nPaul put on his snowshoes.\nFrank clapped him on the shoulder. \u201cGood. If she needs to, she can borrow my cane, though it\u2019s useless in the snow. Oh, there\u2019s a shovel in the garage if we need to clear a path. But go see her first. Ask her what the devil happened.\u201d\nThe snow stopped. Ice crystals twinkled in the frigid air. Paul\u2019s snowshoes squeaked with each step. The floodlight illuminated a wedge of whitened field and charcoal trees sketching where the forest was. Frank could see the girl clearly. A brunette in a navy-blue snowsuit with pink piping, she'd lost her hat and there were goggle marks around her eyes. Now that she'd seen Paul, she was crawling toward him.\nBut Paul marched past her and veered away from the lake. The girl grabbed for his leg. Paul avoided her grasp and headed for the thickest patch of woods. The girl was crying again, and she looked over to Frank standing in his doorway.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he called out. The floodlight probably made it difficult for her to see his face, but he smiled anyway.\nFrank watched Paul continue past her. Another man appeared from behind a tree in front of Paul. Not more than twenty-five yards from the cabin. The man came at Paul. It was Johnson Free.\nJohnson Free. But he moved like a young man and with the tall confident stride of one they knew thirty years ago, their drummer in the Paul Townes Quintet for nine months. A quiet man who, like Paul, had a problem with alcohol. A Chippewa who had disappeared on the morning he refused to play a Snowcatters\u2019 Fourth of July Jamboree. State Police had chain-dragged his pickup from the Wisconsin River. When they opened the driver\u2019s door, Free\u2019s corpse had slithered to the mud. The newspaper had said he was drunk and crashed through a guardrail.\n\u201cPaul, oh God, look out he\u2019s coming for you,\u201d Frank whispered.\nBut Johnson wasn\u2019t attacking Paul. The two men were talking. Paul pointed to the girl and then to Frank. Frank moved behind the door but couldn\u2019t stop watching. Johnson was angry, striking his fist into his palm and yelling. Frank\u2019s ears filled with wind and the girl\u2019s pleas, the conversation lost.\nPaul nodded. Johnson swept his arm out broadly, seeming to indicate the woods, then the sky, and he stomped his feet and shoved Paul to the ground. This powerful barrel-chested man could kick Paul to death and encounter no resistance. Instead, he helped Paul to his feet and brushed the snow from his neck. Johnson spoke, his mouth inches from Paul\u2019s ear. They turned and started walking back toward the lake.\nThe girl, on her feet now, was watching Frank. One of her legs bent out strangely. She was hopping her way to the cabin.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, honey, I'm going to call an ambulance for you,\u201d Frank said. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt yourself. I'm Frank. Behind you, that\u2019s Paul and Johnson. We\u2019re old friends who played in a jazz band together a long time ago, and Johnson\u2019s been out of touch with us for a while but\u2014\u201d\nFrank closed the door.\nWorking together, the two men hauled the screaming girl into the black corridor of the woods.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nFrank didn\u2019t see Paul the next day, but Johnson was there, dawn to dusk, nailing pieces of the girl to the outside of the cabin. Frank pulled kitchen knives out of a drawer, searching, until he found something suitable. Now he had a Chinese cleaver resting in his lap. But Johnson didn\u2019t seem interested in hurting him or even getting inside the cabin. He worked and chanted.\nThe hammering ceased. Johnson began painting the windows. A streaky red film froze quickly into an uneven clotted glaze. He didn\u2019t use a brush. Strands of brown hair snagged in the corners as he wiped the wet scalp over the small panes then paused and dunked it into something Frank couldn\u2019t see. Johnson\u2019s shadow moved out of sight. Blood spilled under Frank\u2019s door, the stain on the wood spreading no bigger than a Christmas card.\nIn the interminable night, Frank got up only to feed the fire and change records. He cloaked himself in the army blanket. When sleep came, it was a sudden engulfment. His grip on the Chinese cleaver loosened and the heavy blade clunked to the floor.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cIt\u2019s me. Open up. I'm freezing my ass off.\u201d\nPaul\u2019s haggard face appeared in the blood-encrusted glass. Frank hoisted himself from the chair. He leaned hard on the cane. At the door, he threw back the bolt.\n\u201cCome in.\u201d\nBut there was no one there. A breeze stirred and the sound of dripping, not all of it snowmelt, pattered like light rain. The air was warm and clear.\nNo Paul.\nLong icicles drooped off the gutter. It took Frank a minute to realize they weren\u2019t normal.\nFrank broke them into pieces with his cane.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nYesterday at the club, Johnson had told Paul. He said the girl brought him back, but the magic was wrong. Johnson had others inside him. He said to kill the girl. Bernadette Pappalardi was her name, granddaughter of Vincent Pappalardi, the meatpacker from Detroit. A Snowcatter.\n\u201cIf we kill her, maybe I go back,\u201d Johnson said as he handed Paul a black-and-white photograph. In the photo, six well-dressed men stood in a circle with their pants unzipped. They were pissing and laughing. Johnson\u2019s corpse lay on the ground at their feet. They aimed for his locked-open mouth. \u201cI found this in the club. I don\u2019t know how. I just knew where to look. Under the floorboards.\u201d A State Police lieutenant and the coroner were both club members, so getting the body was easy. \u201cIt\u2019s bad where I'm at. Because what am I, Paul? Not a man, not a ghost.\u201d Johnson thumped the muscles in his chest. \u201cYou have to help me. Together we can catch her. Make her fix what she broke.\u201d\nPaul had left him at the club, the snow red from the butchered doe Johnson was eating. Heavyweight clouds bore down on the valley. The storm wind kicked the Coleman from his hand twice.\nJohnson had called out to him through the pines, \u201cI\u2019ll bring Bernadette to the cabin tonight. Talk to Frank. You fellas gotta help me.\u201d\nPaul kept walking.\nI should\u2019ve told Frank the whole story. Despite the shape he\u2019s in right now.\nAfter they choked her, nothing had changed. Johnson howled. He beat her skull against a tree. His hunting knife flashed. Paul couldn\u2019t watch. He went to his shitty cabin, which was really nothing more than a trailer, and dropped into his bunk. Paul always knew who he was, what gave him pleasure; but he didn\u2019t know restraint. He knew exhaustion, collapse, running the gas tank dry with the pedal floored under his boot.\nLights out. He knew lights out.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nPaul shrugged, sipped his coffee. It had taken ten minutes for Frank to let him in the cabin. Another hour to fill in the gaps Paul had left in his original story. Paul lit his last cigarette. He'd need to get to town soon, snowed-in roads or not. But the snow had been melting all morning. They could probably drive out and forget this crazy mess.\nPaul said, \u201cYou know Johnson believed in witches. He thought the Snowcatters were a coven.\u201d\n\u201cHmm.\u201d Frank swallowed his tea and added another squirt of lemon. \u201cWhere\u2019s Johnson now?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t know. The woods probably.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know why he painted my house with that witch girl\u2019s blood?\u201d\n\u201cHe said it was to protect us. He did the same thing to my trailer while I was asleep.\u201d\n\u201cNeed more coffee?\u201d Frank asked.\n\u201cI'm jittery enough, thanks.\u201d\nFrank poured the remains of the pot in the sink. \u201cWhat\u2019s he protecting us from?\u201d\nPaul shook his head. \u201cI have no idea.\u201d\n\u201cI think we should go to the club and end this. The old toboggan is in the garage. You could pull me, it\u2019s downhill for the most part, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cJohnson said to stay away from the club.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to listen to him?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Paul said as he watched the cigarette burn between his fingers.\n\u201cBut he was wrong about killing the girl, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d\nPaul breathed a deep sigh. \u201cLet me finish my cigarette, and then I\u2019ll go get the goddamned sled.\u201d\n\u201cTake your time. I\u2019ve got to put my long johns on. You\u2019ll have to help me with the ice on the stoop.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cRadio said another storm\u2019s coming through tonight. Should be a record snowfall for this month. Can you imagine more on top of this?\u201d Frank asked.\nPaul mumbled.\n\u201cWhat, Dearie?\u201d\n\u201cI said I need a sonofabitching cigarette.\u201d\n\u201cAnd a drink too, I\u2019ll bet.\u201d Frank slipped off a mitten and dug into the folds of his coat. \u201cHere, take a break.\u201d He stretched out his arm and offered a stainless steel flask.\n\u201cI think Johnson\u2019s watching us. I heard branches breaking,\u201d Paul said.\n\u201che\u2019s an Indian, Dearie, he doesn\u2019t step on branches.\u201d\nPaul gulped Scotch.\nAhead on the trail, woodsmoke began to rise in a column. Johnson\u2019s chanting started. He was waiting at the club. The sunset cut low through the barren treetops. It would be dark in an hour. Paul lit the Coleman. He felt a fist squeezing his chest.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go back, Frank.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s going to haul me up that hill? You can hardly breathe as it is.\u201d Frank flicked his naked fingers in the air, summoning the flask. He polished off its contents. \u201cNo, we\u2019re going to warm ourselves by the Indian\u2019s fire. And we\u2019ll ask him to go away and leave us alone. I'm sitting on two sleeping bags. We can tuck away in a solid corner of the club and burn the rest. Someone will report the fire. Nobody will freeze, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\nPaul jerked the sled ten yards forward to a slope in the trail. The slope leveled out at the club lot. Paul climbed aboard the toboggan. They could see Johnson, and he spotted them.\nJohnson was chanting fast and loud. Even from a distance, they saw spit fly silver from his lips. Stripped to his underwear, he danced in the ruins of Snowcatters'. Johnson\u2019s muscles flexed hard as he leaped over rotted beams, folding chairs, a plywood podium fallen sideways in the snow. He used the hunting knife to slash invisible predators above his head. The chant grew frenzied without losing its rhythm.\n\u201cTwitches\u2014 twitches\u2014 twitches!\u201d\nPaul made no sense of it. Johnson\u2019s words slowed as he crouched like a baseball catcher. He put down the knife and made snowballs, then picked it up again. Johnson was laughing. Whirling. Stabbing the air. He screwed the knifepoint into the meat of his arm and tasted his own blood. His eyes turned golden.\n\u201cTwitches\u2014 too wi chezz\u2014 too wi chezzzz\u2014\u201d\nTwo witches. That\u2019s what Johnson was saying.\nFrank patted Paul on the thigh. \u201cEven at your advanced age, you\u2019re stronger than poor Bernadette.\u201d\nBefore Paul had a chance to ask Frank how he knew that, Frank gave a push with his cane, and the two old men rode to the bottom like little boys.\n\u2022\n\u00a9 2001 Steven Sidor, all rights reserved\nSteven Sidor\u2019s short story, \u201cMopping Up,\u201d won first prize in the Horrorfind.com Weird War Fiction Contest.

I hoped from that corner of the house there would be less chance of the trio detecting the presence of my son, whom I had locked away upstairs only moments ago. I pictured him crouched safely behind the double-doored closet, with strong walls constructed of red oak, and barred with the most durable tungsten locking mechanism we could afford.\nMy visitors clearly took great care to put on ordinary appearances. So I did my best not to linger on the skin-holes or missing swathes of hair atop their skulls, and I carefully chose my moments to smile warmly and seated them at our kitchen table, glancing briefly at their wondrously inky eyes, which swallowed the surrounding light just as my grandfather had always described \u2014 wells of blackness surrounded by distended facial muscles that rested unevenly on cheekbones but might at any moment cascade from their faces. Each of them chose business attire for this occasion \u2014 ill-fitting but expensive suit-clothes, crooked in the shoulders or uneven in the sleeves, all tailored for other bodies. Every feature and characteristic summoned a familiar voice from the depths of my memory \u2014 something low and slow, like gravel crushed underfoot.\nNever cross Our Quiet Guests, I remembered my grandfather saying in sour breaths that clouded around him near the fireplace. Often the same advice night after night, when he could still speak without slurring.\nAnd, yes, absolutely, cross them I would not.\nBecause I very well understood the Rules and what was required. I knew, for example, to begin preparing coffee as my token hospitality, without the slightest delay or sign of hesitation, maintaining a steady stream of conversation over my shoulder \u2014 although I wasn\u2019t sure it qualified as conversation with every question of mine left to hang in the air, unanswered. The toasted fragrance of freshly-ground Guatemalan coffee scooped into the filter atop the glass carafe, the rush and patter of water into the kettle that I set upon the range, the whoosh of the flame licking from beneath \u2014 all allowed me adequate sense of normalcy to pretend these were just passersby.\nNevertheless, a nervous titter escaped me when my hands hovered over the Japanese ceramic cream pitcher and sugar bowl, and I realized how empty we had allowed them to become, what with so few stores carrying the variety to which we\u2019d grown accustomed. My wife, after weeks of my reminders, had gone this morning to shops beyond our suburb to restock the dwindling basement supplies, leaving me here with some embarrassment and in the presence of very significant company, to deal with the results of her irresponsibility, and I suppose, some of my own.\nA part of me knew that the sugar, cream, and my petty annoyance were smaller symptoms of something more daunting going on \u2014 a disastrous state of the world and its escalating problems \u2014 things that I always found too difficult, or perhaps too unpleasant, to grasp.\nMy grandfather had warned how Our Quiet Guests appeared in his old country too, just as it was on the precipice of a monumental violent failure \u2014 not so much harbingers of the fall or the civil war or the famine that followed, as drawn there because of it, he believed.\nLike worms breaking from the soil after a storm, the old man would whisper from his chair by the fire.\nMy three visitors only confirmed the suspicions growing in me for many months, that with every alarming headline, every essential disappearing from the shelves, and every government department becoming more and more difficult to contact, we were all soon headed to a very bad place.\nOur Quiet Guests sensed it too.\nMy hands continued of their own accord across the countertop, doing the preparatory work of a gracious host as best as possible in these circumstances, and I kept watch on the street for cars coming or going, imagining with dread what would happen if my wife were to return. I permitted myself the fantasy, if just for a second, of being the kind of man who might shout or wave my arms at the window, give her a chance of escape. But, knowing my nature, even if I were to see her lovely face, I would undoubtedly remain transfixed, paralyzed by the breath of those three behind me. So I could only pray that she was delayed, and would continue to be so, for her own sake.\n\u201cIf you wouldn\u2019t mind telling me. How do you prefer to take your coffee, Messieurs?\u201d I turned to my three visitors and saw that things had already gone wrong.\nIt was their shoes. Each of Our Quiet Guests had removed them without a word. All six Oxfords rested on the kitchen table like loam-crusted bricks to make clear what I now realized: somehow, at some point, I had already committed a critical error.\nI saw flashes of my grandfather clutching my forearm with his good hand, pressing into the tender skin with his unkempt nails. If something goes wrong, they\u2019ll make their displeasure known, he muttered, an emphasis on every edge of every consonant. And maybe, just maybe, they will forgive one broken Rule or two. But don\u2019t expect them to remain civil if you continue down an uncouth road. Each time you offend, they will see it as permission to reciprocate, escalate, any and all mistreatment.\nSo you must never, and I mean never, cross Our Quiet Guests.\nYes. Obviously. I understood his point, as well as what these three were trying to tell me by presenting their footwear so unceremoniously. But for the life of me, I couldn\u2019t understand why now?\nWhat, specifically, had I done to earn their ire, given how little had transpired?\nDid I forget some customary greeting or introductory question in my hurry to usher them into the kitchen? Did I speak incessantly as I prepared at the counter, saying too many things about myself? Or was it more intangible, something in my tone \u2014 too sharp and imperative in offering them seats or in describing the coffee? Or was I so pathetic, so subservient and unctuous, that my tenor itself managed to cause offense?\nWhatever the case, none of the Guests reacted to my alarm.\nThey remained in their seats with black eyes wide and mouths agape, in a kind of excitement, a slight whistling through crooked teeth with soft sighs.\n\u201cI\u2019ll assume\u2026 for the\u2026 coffees, that is\u2026\u201d I began to feel unease in my throat. \u201cThat black is sufficient\u2026 unless you say otherwise.\u201d\nAgain, their dark eyes and gasping orifices provided no intelligible response.\nDespite what I hoped to be my first and only indiscretion, still completely unknown to me, I proceeded to pour and serve as I would any afternoon visitors; and while doing so, I couldn\u2019t help, whether due to curiosity or dread, but to take notice of their feet, now de-shoed and splayed upon the travertine tile.\nThe appendages were so pale and moist as to be nearly translucent, giving the impression that a dripping sac surrounded their extremities; and each toe, without the cap of a nail, swelled and stretched as it rubbed against floor, like the feelers of an insect sensing every texture and vibration. And the smell. Some god awful and unmistakable chemical odor emanated from those naked feet. Similar to chlorine from the community pool, but so foul that my eyes began to sting. I placed the first cup beside one set of shoes, and then the second beside another.\nUnfortunately, in contemplating the strangeness of my visitors\u2019 feet, I was not careful enough with their hands, because the last Guest had extended his, as if to take the final coffee cup from me, courteously. And so I, without much thought, went through the natural motion of giving the desired object.\nBut, and I swear I did not imagine this \u2014 at least, I don\u2019t think it was something I would project under such serious circumstances \u2014 rather than grasp the cup as any typical visitor might, the final Guest let his long and pallid fingers open at just the moment of our hand-off, allowing the vessel to fall unceremoniously from my grip.\nAnd what could I do except watch aghast as the full cup splashed and tumbled, like its god-given purpose was to crash into the tile at full force, shattering apart in a detonation of shards and liquid at our ankles?\n\u201cMy apologies! I\u2019m so sorry! I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I clutched the lower half of my face.\nThat Quiet Guest who had let the cup plummet between us widened his mouth, the corners curling upward at my distress. The three of them began huffing rapid hisses from their hanging jaws.\nWhy?\nAgain, I felt a whirlwind of confusion and despair. If I was supposed to treat them with courtesy, to follow the Rules, just as I had been \u2014 why would he lure me into such a situation where I\u2019d have no choice but to err?\n\u201cPlease!\u201d I cried.\nOur Quiet Guests tightened their shoulders, their entire bodies grew taut and any moment they would rise from their seats and take hold of me. So I did the only thing I knew to do, what someone of my character does when faced with something too painful to bear: I groveled. Without dithering or qualification or smallest shred of dignity, I groveled.\n\u201cI understand!\u201d I held out my arms, like someone trying to placate feral hounds. \u201cI\u2019m from one of the old families, so I know the way these things work. You see? With you. With the Rules. I know. I know!\u201d\nImages of my grandfather returned to me, him raising his bad hand in the firelight. The missing and mangled portions of his body like misshapen cobwebs of flesh had frightened me as a child, but not so much as his stories about what had been done, what had to be done, for the Guests with their many ancient Rules of hospitality.\n\u201cLook.\u201d I slid the chef\u2019s knife from the nearby block, and, just as my grandfather had shown me, I set its edge across the second knuckle of my pinky. The subsequent pain, though close to unfathomable, was a rushing release, as bone and muscle and tendon separated from my hand.\nTheir response was immediate: a chorus of clicking feverish delight. Grunts and guttural trills from the three visitors when I, trembling, picked up the bloody offering and placed it on the table where the shattered cup, still at my feet, should have gone.\nThe Guest who\u2019d betrayed me with his dexterous trick hovered over the ruby-splashed finger, stretching apart his slackened spit-lined mouth, to permit his true body, long and tentacular, to emerge.\nThe distorted muscles along that fleshy extension of the Guest\u2019s form reminded me of a starfish or maybe a freshwater eel. At the far tip of the frightening form I glimpsed the mouth \u2014 a spiraling corkscrew of jagged edges disappearing into the shadowy esophagus.\nIt felt an eternity, but in truth it was very few seconds from the creature\u2019s emergence to snapping up my severed pinky with a forceful chitter, to retraction entirely back into the spithole where it hid.\nMore. Always offer more, my grandfather had explained, showing me the scars where he\u2019d pried flesh from himself, along the hand and forearm, parts of his calf, and several toes. Until they calm, you must always plan to give more.\nBut why? I recalled asking. That just doesn\u2019t seem right.\nIt had been the only time, I think, that I\u2019d ever questioned my grandfather\u2019s ranting, at least openly and in such a firm manner. Even then it had felt so fundamentally imbalanced, the inherent asymmetry of the Rules.\nThose feelings came back as I raised the knife and, fearing the alternative if I did not continue with the Rules, proceeded to lean down with my weight again, again. More fingers rolled off the countertop, landing wet and inert on the floor before I brought them to the table and served. Again, again, those fleshy bulging Guest shapes appeared from those two other mouths, sucking and crunching insatiably.\nIt\u2019s not fair! I had insisted, and I\u2019ll never forget my grandfather\u2019s face in the shifting shadow and firelight, the lines of aggravation and agony twisting his features, his good hand digging into my arm, that sour breath.\nOnly an idiot child would expect such a thing. Fair\u2026 It doesn\u2019t matter what seems fair. You never cross Our Quiet Guests. Do you understand me, stupid child? You never cross them. Never!\nThe torrent of my blood, even staunched with a darkening dishcloth, began to make me dizzy, and I slid down the cabinet to the tile in a mess of ceramic shards, while the Guests enjoyed themselves noisily.\nNone of it, fair. None of it, of course.\nYes, Grandfather, I understood.\nBut I did my part. Despite my stupidity and hope, I thought he would agree. I did what was warranted to satisfy their needs, and we had reached a point of equilibrium that would bring mercy, and departing my home in peace, as they did in all of the family stories I\u2019d been told.\nThen came the noise. The thump. And with it a feeling of strange finality, like a gate shutting off a path.\nOur Quiet Guests looked, pooled ink eyes drawn to the ceiling, and their gelatinous toes rubbed vigorously against the floor, following the sound to where I already feared it would take them \u2014 up the stairs, down the hall, into the far bedroom and behind thick red oak doors bound with tungsten locks.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I think I said aloud, soft and insubstantial, my bloody fist wrapped in dishcloth raised to plea. \u201cNo. I have more here to give.\u201d\nBut they didn\u2019t care for anything I had to say.\nI watched two of them depart the table and make way to the stairs, while the third Guest, the fellow with the trouble holding cups, leaned over me with visible anticipation. As his true self surfaced again from the false mouth and began to chew at what was left of my injured hand, crunching to the bone while I sobbed in his shadow, it occurred to me that the Rules did not apply anymore, here in my home, no. If they even applied at all.\nThe ominous sound of soggy feet pressing onto each stair tread seemed impossibly loud to me. Another, then another, then another in turn. As I lay shivering in sweat, my body entering shock and my wrist disappearing into the writhing Guest, I saw my grandfather\u2019s face; not that angry deformed shape by the fireplace, but cold and still, sallow and caked with powder, set in a dark silent box.\nThese Rules, these ideas about how we ought to be, maybe they helped that old man live a little longer when Guests visited him, but not without cost, and still with the same inescapable end descending upon me.\nThe sound of wet footsteps echoed through our home, and things grew darker when I felt the Guest burrowing its spiral teeth into my eye, my face hot and wet. But I listened for the noises upstairs: the creaking of a bedroom door preceded by cries, shouts for help, screams for father.\nAll I could think, with each second in roiling waves of pain, was the meaninglessness of all that had come to pass.\nThe Rules had served no purpose that I could understand, other than to hinder the will of these beings and their hunger, which I finally understood could never be sated.\nI was sure that no matter what I did now, no matter how I begged or pleaded or paid with politeness, I was already a dead man, what with the rending of my body. Just a transitioning corpse, set for the same kind of box as my grandfather before me.\nMy thoughts drifted back to my wife, her lovely face somewhere out there, bargaining for supplies as the world came undone, things crumbling everywhere we turned \u2014 the terrible conditions that drew Our Quiet Guests to us in the first place. Oddly separated from what I was enduring, I was forced to consider the greater ruin coming, that would encroach no matter how many trinkets and fineries and comforts we surrounded ourselves with in this little home.\nAnd as I considered the truth of where it was all undoubtedly going, something peculiar occurred while I lay there with my face being chewed away. In my fading belief that I and my family and the world would continue \u2014 it felt Our Quiet Guests had given me a gift, one last thing to appreciate before the end that I saw so clearly.\nIf I was certain to die, no matter what I said or did, no matter what Rule I followed or disregarded, then I was now finally unburdened by hope, and free of the fear, so familiar and close, that constantly followed in its wake.\nThese half-reasoned notions spun messily in my mind while my blood spattered across my face and the cabinets and the flock wallpaper. It all spun and spun, this way and that, as I reached delicately to a shard of broken coffee cup on the tile.\nFor once, there was no thought, no plan, no preconceived ideas of my actions or the outcome.\nI drove the sharp ceramic fragment deeply into the soft moist matter of the creature\u2019s sensitive foot.\nThe Guest detached and his dripping self flopped and trilled wildly in the air, but not too fast for me to grab his true throat and lock him close between bicep and maimed forearm. My good hand spidered aside to pick up the chef\u2019s knife from the bloodied tile, and I plunged the point into him. Mucoid fluids rained down as I sawed fervently, separating the soft snail Guest from its man-shell, and when the snaking creature was eviscerated, the suited body fell against my chest, with the unmistakable flaccidity of the newly dead.\nThe other Guests upstairs did not react. They battered against those red oak doors. I listened carefully to each thud as I dragged myself upright and pulled my soon-to-be-carcass up the stairs with the last of my strength, step by step.\nIt all seemed so comprehensible for once, the commands and etiquette I\u2019d been taught all fallen away, and my knife still slick from blood that did, and did not, belong to me.\nI was never going to survive to see a better end, with the Guests or with this world. I accepted and understood that. Whether my boy would be fortunate enough to live through the horrors to come, or especially if he would not \u2014 all that I could do for him, all that I could show him, was that I did not collapse inwardly without struggle in those final moments, that I did not leave him crying out for me in the darkness, all alone.\nThe afternoon light from the bedroom window warmed my bloodied cheek for a moment as I watched the blurred hungry shapes crash against the splintering red oak doors. I gathered what remained of me and raised the dripping knife, so that my son would know.\nI tried something, in the end.\nI tried something.\nI tried.\n\u2022\nFront & Back cover art by Rew X\n\u2022\nJulie Ireland\nBear Weiter\nKelly L.\nJessica Guptill\nThomas Ha\nMaria Haskins\nLorna D.

In fact, I carry with me slightly altered forgeries of the secret documents Collinge is expected to hand over to Consul Mondrilland. The real Collinge will remain in Paris, in the basement of our safe house in the neuvi\u00e8me arrondissement, enjoying the attentions of Marilyse Bourque, a particularly ruthless interrogator and skillful propagandist. If it is determined that Monsieur Collinge can be turned against the current regime, he will survive the encounter.\nThe customs agent hands back my travel documents with an earnest declaration of patriotism \u2014 \u201cPour la France pure et \u00e9ternelle\u201d \u2014 a rote phrase we are all expected to utter to display our allegiance. He is so earnest that I suspect him of in fact believing the opposite of what protocol behooves him to profess. Under the pretext of wanting to express my satisfaction to his superior, I get his name. We need more allies. We need everyone to reject this new state of affairs, but war is a convenient context for the fear-mongering that fuels the new regime. The fascists didn\u2019t start this war, but they profit from it greatly.\nI settle into my berth with the help of a matronly porter. I recognize her southern accent, and I instantly win her over by praising the beauty of Occitan French. I add, \u201cI remember, before the war, this train always brimmed with passengers.\u201d\nTo which she obligingly replies, \u201cPerhaps, but it makes my work easier to only have eleven passengers to tend to.\u201d A manageable number for me, too \u2014 especially that it is unlikely that all these will be staying the course the entire journey to Constantinople. \u201cAlthough the tips were both more generous and more abundant before the war.\u201d\nNot missing my cue, I hand over a generous gratuity. I press further: \u201cAre any of my fellow passengers also en route to Constantinople? Before supper, I should like to share a cognac with them and wish them good travels.\u201d\nThere are only five others I need to concern myself with. I wonder how \u00c9douard is faring on the northern route?\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe now defunct Utopia of France, my home nation, had upheld, or at least claimed to uphold, the values of truth, justice, and equality. V\u00e9rit\u00e9. Justice. \u00c9galit\u00e9. The words are carved in stone for all to see at the entrance of the Palais de Bourbon, the French parliament. But those are now hollow words. Nevertheless, my brother and I have always lived by that motto, even if France no longer does. The Utopian government was compromised by long-standing sleeper agents that undermined the values of the Utopia and instead allied France with the fascist regimes that have swept most of Europe into the fledgling supernation calling itself the United States of Europe. But \u00c9douard and I will never serve these new masters.\nUntil recently my twin brother and I were field agents of the Utopia\u2019s Bureau d\u2019action et d\u2019intelligence, but now we are part of an underground network that is trying to sabotage the fascist governments of the USE, expose the shadowy Invisible Fingers, and, more ambitiously, achieve a peaceful and bloodless end to the Second Global War.\nAs part of the European Resistance, \u00c9douard and I help \u201cundesirables\u201d escape the new regime. The majority of them are bound for either the Mediterranean Communities or the United Emirates of Allah, where, we know, the able-bodied will likely be conscripted to fight, perhaps eventually even against France as the war continues to escalate. The whole world is on a short fuse, ready to explode in every possible vector. Sending refugees to potential enemies of France is an ethical dilemma that \u00c9douard and I still discuss. But ultimately we always come to the same conclusion: we do what is right \u2014 it is no longer safe anywhere in the United States of Europe for those not deemed of pure European heritage.\nAs the train departs from the first scheduled stop at Lausanne, in the French administrative region of Suisse, I join my travelling companions in the lounge car. I make sure to arrive five minutes late, and I am satisfied that my suspects are all waiting for me. Within minutes, after a flurry of introductions, all six of us sit around two small adjoining tables enjoying particularly fine cognac. My prey, if he or she is travelling on this route, must be among these five passengers.\nThe two nervous elderly ladies of means from Brighton are travelling together, under the guise of cousins, but I perceive their bond to be of the heart rather than of the blood. Only a year ago, they would not have needed to be so circumspect, but it is not a good idea to test to the limits of tolerance in the United States of Europe.\n\u201cWe so love the Communities. Constantinople is so charmingly exotic. Isn\u2019t that so, Jessica?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Patricia. While it\u2019s still allowed to vacation there, we should not miss the opportunity. We might not have another. What with the state of the world.\u201d\nI suspect their true intention is to flee their home in the European State of Allied Britannia and seek refugee status within the progressive Mediterranean Communities. For now, I deem them unlikely suspects.\nSitting with the two Englishwomen, and charming them with suave ease, is Mannfred Mannheim \u2014 a tall and muscular German businessman who divides his time among the international corporate headquarters of his engineering firm in Berlin, Paris, and Constantinople. I have met Mannheim before, but he does not appear to recognize me. Our encounter occurred seven years ago in Cologne, during the case of the Dumont forgeries. I was disguised as Marcel-Antoine Provost, a sculptor in search of patronage. Mannheim\u2019s status would provide an excellent cover for an agent of the Invisible Fingers, whose main funding is suspected to come from business interests who want to wrest power from legitimate governments. Should he recognize me \u2014 although Provost\u2019s beard, long hair, and glasses changed my appearance to such an extent that I doubt he will \u2014 it would be an easy feint to claim that the \u201cartist\u201d he met seven years ago is my brother and that his different surname is a bohemian affectation. Mannheim may appear to be a likely suspect, but I must not let that perhaps too obvious assumption cloud my observation of the other passengers.\nYusuf Khaiat is a Turkish flautist whose four-year-long contract with the world-renowned Philharmonie de Paris has now expired. His tenure began before the formation of the USE and before the new war. With no possibility of visa renewal under the new regime, he is now en route back to his home in Istanbul. As a notoriously nonreligious citizen of the faith-based United Emirates of Allah, he might have a personal stake in the status of the Byzantine twin cities. Another likely suspect. Khaiat has already finished his glass of cognac \u2014 the rest of us are still sipping at ours. I motion the bartender to refill his glass. The musician nods at me. \u201cYou are a most gracious host, effendi. May I invite you to breakfast tomorrow? At seven?\u201d I nod back my acceptance.\nThe final travellerto Constantinople is a young Frenchwoman with a Breton accent. Answering a question from the flirtatious musician, Sandrine Madec informs us: \u201cMy doctoral thesis is on the impact of secular Mediterranean culture on Muslim family dynamics in the border regions of the Emirates and the Communities. I\u2019m doing field work in the Byzantine twin cities.\u201d\nThe Englishwomen coo appreciatively, but Mannheim seems bored, while Khaiat\u2019s eyes glow with unabashed lust. As for me, I don\u2019t know enough yet whether to believe her, or if she might be more than she purports.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI wish I could communicate with \u00c9douard and share up-to-date intelligence. We\u2019ve heard that scientists in the United Emirates of Allah have invented a long-distance portable communication device. What a boon such technology would be for the European Resistance! The rest of the world is always playing catch-up with UEA science.\nNext the border patrol of the Mediterranean Communities goes through the train. Soon, we are again en route.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSometimes stereotypes are handy shortcuts, but I should not succumb to that impulse with this unusual Turk. It takes courage, or stupidity, for a citizen of the Emirates to be such a vocal atheist, and Yusuf Khaiat is no idiot.\nWhen he sees me, his face lights up in delight. \u201cGood morning, effendi!\u201d\nI greet the two of them. Khaiat whispers something in Madec\u2019s ear. She nods in assent, then wastes no time and excuses herself. \u201cI\u2019m not really hungry anyway, and I should get some sleep.\u201d Without even sipping at it, she smells her coffee once more before getting up. The two of them touch fingers briefly as she leaves.\nKhaiat turns to me: \u201cWould you mind if I ordered for both of us?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to be your guest, Yusuf.\u201d\nOur waitress is Turkish, and he orders breakfast in their shared language, much too fast and colloquially for me to follow, despite my passing familiarity with a few words and phrases.\nWe exchange pleasantries as we wait for the food, and now I can tell that something is happening between the lines. Khaiat is sussing me out, observing me much too keenly for this to be a mere casual get-together. He is biding his time, waiting to spring something on me. My curiosity is definitely piqued. Finally, the food arrives: an abundant variety of Turkish breakfast mezze.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve eaten mezze before, I see.\u201d\n\u201cIt is the best food in the world, my friend!\u201d\nKhaiat smiles as the waitress lays out twenty-odd small sharing dishes. For the next forty minutes we silently enjoy muhlama, a menemen scramble, three kinds of b\u00f6rek, sucuk saugages, olives, bal kaymak, yogurt, tomato and cucumber salad, stuffed dates, figs in honey, roasted pistachios, and various cheeses, breads, and condiments.\nAfterward, over spiced black coffee, Khaiat\u2019s body language shifts, as if he were now poised for action. \u201cIt pleases me that you take such delight in Turkish food, mas\u2026\u201d he switches from French to Portuguese and also lowers his voice, \u201cwho are you really, effendi?\u201d\nI continue in the same language, unfazed by his question. We both understand that fewer people are likely to understand Portuguese aboard this train. \u201cWhat makes you ask that, my friend?\u201d\n\u201cDuring my years with the Philharmonie de Paris, I gave many private recitals at government functions. I have met Armand Collinge on several occasions, and you are nothing like that distasteful little fascist. In fact, I would wager that you are no fascist at all.\u201d\nWe stare at each other, neither of us blinking or even moving a hair.\nFinally \u2014 because the clock is ticking and I must be bold if I want to get anywhere in this investigation \u2014 I say one word: \u201cByzantium.\u201d\nHis eyes are like daggers. \u201cThat you know to use that name, here and now, tells me that you are a player in this game. But there are more than two sides, and I fear we may yet prove to be enemies. I would regret that, effendi.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI see no advantage in not being candid with the Turk. If he is an enemy, deception will not change that at this point; if he is an ally, then the truth will reinforce our bond.\nStill, in this game of give and take, we each parcel out information, taking turns sharing snippets with each other.\nAt one point the door slides open \u2014 we were both so wrapped in each other\u2019s narratives when we should also have been paying attention to possible eavesdroppers. Magali, our Occitan porter, berates us. \u201cWhy are you giving me more work? I shall have to clean this one, too, now.\u201d We both understand her true meaning and each hand her a much too generous gratuity.\nYusuf stands by the door. \u201cShe is gone.\u201d He slides the door shut, and we resume our conversation.\nYusuf is a member of the Byzantine Resistance, which is active in both Istanbul and Constantinople and whose goal is to restore Byzantium, independent from both the Italian rule of the Mediterranean Communities and the Islamic grip of the United Emirates of Allah. The UEA and the Communities are currently allied against the Eternal Chinese Empire, the Hindu Supremacy, and the Antipodes (who are also all at war with each other), which is taxing each power\u2019s military resources. Now is the time to strike. Yusuf spent his time with the Philharmonie courting diplomatic allies from many world powers, allies who understand the long-term strategic value of a neutral zone at the junction of the Communities and the UEA. He is returning home with information vital to the resistance, information that will put into motion a plan to wrest Byzantium back from its two conquerors.\nI ask, \u201cHow are the Invisible Fingers involved?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are the Invisible Fingers?\u201d\nI explain about the secret cabal of financiers masterminding the Second Global War and their possible agent on this train.\n\u201cIs that who they are\u2026\u201d Yusuf is aware that a group has been funnelling mercenaries into the twin cities, but the Resistance has been unable, so far, to learn much about them or their plans. \u201cPerhaps we are allies after all. I will help you uncover this agent. For the good of Byzantium.\u201d\n\u201cWhat of the French girl? What\u2019s her role in this?\u201d\n\u201cShe is pleasant company for the journey, that is all.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps we ought not to trust anyone. The agent could be any of the travellers to Constantinople. And she is a likely suspect.\u201d\n\u201cThen all the more reason to keep her close. To keep an eye on her.\u201d He tries to sound all business, but the lascivious artist can\u2019t suppress the leer from either his tone or his eyes.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nA few minutes to midnight, the train arrives at the border station outside Trieste, where we are once again subjected to what I expect to be a routine exit check by Mediterranean officers, but unusually we are all escorted out of the train, which is then searched with dogs. I assume these are new wartime security measures. Inside the border station, we line up to get questioned at an agent\u2019s desk. Every travelleris grilled with unusual ferocity. When they get to me, they only give my papers a cursory glance and I am quickly asked to follow a guard deeper into the station. Could something be amiss with my documents? I maintain the cool confidence of someone travelling with diplomatic privileges while being careful not to antagonize the border agents.\nThe Mediterranean Communities are covert allies of the European Resistance, but it is nevertheless a crime to cross a border under an assumed identity, and the Communities must juggle aiding us with respecting their official agreements with the USE. Not every government employee is aware of our clandestine arrangement. I might be in serious danger.\nI am brought to a dark room and left with a man whose bulky silhouette I can barely discern \u2014 the only light seeps in through the minute slit in the doorframe. Before a word is uttered, I suspect the man\u2019s identity. He wipes his brow several times \u2014 due to a glandular condition that makes him sweat profusely \u2014 confirming that I am indeed in the presence of Hermann Mikaalson, former Gestapo Intelligence Oberhaupt of the Northern Reich (before the fascists overthrew the Reich), now publicly believed to be dead and secretly the ringleader of the European Resistance but operating from the Mediterranean Communities.\n\u201cI have sad news, \u00c9mile.\u201d Again, he wipes his brow. \u201cThere was a bombing on the northern line of the Orient Express as the train pulled out of the Strasbourg station.\u201d He pauses to once more observe his sweat-wiping ritual. \u201cThere were no survivors. The Bureau d\u2019action et d\u2019intelligence has already identified one body as that of either you or your identical brother. They are under the assumption that you were both on that train and thus both dead \u2014 a notion that our inside agent has helped strengthen. The devastation is such that they might never identify all of the deceased.\u201d\nI remain still as a statue. \u00c9douard and I have been considered enemies of the state since the fall of the Utopian government. Traitors in the eyes of France \u2014 but it is France that betrayed the values of v\u00e9rit\u00e9, justice, and \u00e9galit\u00e9. We never did. I never will. I try to not let my voice betray the tears I am suppressing. \u201cWhat are my orders?\u201d Mikaalson does not answer immediately. While he again wipes his brow, I collect myself. \u00c9douard and I knew the risks we were taking. We knew the stakes for which we were fighting. For which I will forever fight, in his memory.\n\u201cNo-one has yet claimed responsibility, but we must assume, \u00c9mile, that the incident is related to your mission. It is completely in keeping with the methods of the Invisible Fingers to stage such an attack to further stoke the flames of war.\u201d He pauses to wipe his face. \u201cDo you need help with this \u2018Byzantium\u2019 case? I can have an operative board at Beograd or Sofiya.\u201d\nI do not hesitate. \u201cNo. I can handle this myself. But have a contact ready on the platform at each station. In Constantinople, too. How will I identify them?\u201d\n\u201cThis week, it\u2019s a black beret with red piping. Identify yourself by asking \u2018Was it in Istanbul or Constantinople that we first met?\u2019\u201d\nThen I tell Mikaalson what I\u2019ve learned about Yusuf and the Byzantine Resistance.\n\u201cDo you believe him?\u201d\n\u201cI think so. He\u2019s had several opportunities to betray me to customs officials.\u201d\n\u201cTrust your instincts, but stay cautious. Stay alive.\u201d A pause. Another sweat-wiping motion. Followed by an awkward silence. And then: \u201cI\u2019m truly sorry, \u00c9mile.\u201d Mikaalson\u2019s voice catches in his throat, and I\u2019m grateful for that sign of emotion.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe next morning, as scheduled, I meet Yusuf for another breakfast feast. Sandrine Madec is again sitting with him. I wish she weren\u2019t, so that I could discuss things more freely, but, then again, this might be a good opportunity to suss out if she is the agent of the Invisible Fingers.\n\u201cEffendi! I was worried about you! When I saw the border guards take you away\u2026\u201d\nI decide a half-truth is best. Besides, their reactions might give something away. \u201cI was taken aside as a professional courtesy.\u201d I tap the diplomatic tag on my jacket. \u201cTo give me information. I\u2019m forbidden to fill you in on all the details, but the news will spread soon enough.\u201d I lower my voice to a whisper. \u201cThe northern line of the Express was bombed outside of Strasbourg.\u201d\nThat jolts them. There are questions on their faces. I detect nothing rehearsed in either of them. I doubt they were involved. But they could be too adept at deception to be so easily caught.\nMadec starts to ask: \u201cWas anyone\u2014?\u201d\nI cut her off. \u201cThat\u2019s all I can say.\u201d\nThey both nod; we all stay silent, observing one another.\nYusuf finally says, \u201cI suppose one should lose his appetite after such news, but I hope neither of you will be offended that I will nevertheless indulge in breakfast. And I hope you will both join me.\u201d This morning Madec stays with us.\nSomething catches Yusuf\u2019s eyes. I follow his gaze. Mannfred Mannheim has walked into the dining car. Yusuf and I exchange subtle nods. Unfortunately Madec notices. So much for subtlety. Perhaps this matter will best be resolved overtly rather than covertly.\nI wave at Mannheim, inviting him to join us.\nYusuf offers to buy everyone breakfast, but Mannheim overrules him. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. We\u2019ll take advantage of your cultural expertise. You Turks prepare the best breakfasts in the world. But it would be absurd for me not to pay.\u201d Mannheim is wealthy beyond measure \u2014 a prime candidate for membership in the Invisible Fingers. \u201cPlease make sure to order extra portions of those delicious sucuk saugages.\u201d\nUnlike the previous morning, breakfast is not eaten in silence. The conversation is freewheeling. Yusuf is especially good at getting tongues wagging, and it doesn\u2019t take much to get the opinionated Mannheim going. Madec, however, observes more than participates. To be fair, between Yusuf and Mannheim, it\u2019s not easy to get a word in. The war is an unavoidable topic.\nYusuf whispers, \u201cHave you heard about the bombing?\u201d\nMannheim presses him to elaborate.\nThe German businessman is disgusted. \u201cI hate this war. We had a century of peace, and life was good for everyone. No good can come out of this.\u201d\nI push a little. \u201cBut isn\u2019t all this warfare good business for an international engineering firm?\u201d\n\u201cI cannot deny that contracts are rolling in. But to think war is good business is short-sighted. The purpose of enterprise is to increase welfare and quality of life. For all people. War does neither of these things. Short-term profit is a stupid way to think of business.\u201d\nIs he protesting too loudly? I don\u2019t think so. There\u2019s a passionate quality to his tone that is hard to discredit.\n\u201cFew, if any, of your fellow business magnates would agree, effendi.\u201d\n\u201cI know. It disgusts me how gleefully my peers are coaxing their governments to step up the war machine.\u201d\nMadec snorts. \u201cA pacifist capitalist? Are you putting on a show for our benefit? Don\u2019t waste your breath.\u201d\nThe German and the Frenchwoman disliked each other on sight when we all first met. Things have not improved. Mannheim\u2019s eyes bulge with fury, but he stays his tongue. We\u2019re all silent for a beat. Yusuf and I exchange a glance. We\u2019re curious how this will play out.\nFinally Mannheim says, \u201cPerhaps I\u2019m not welcome here after all.\u201d\nMadec gets up. \u201cNo, you stay. I\u2019m the one who should leave. I was rude. I apologize.\u201d Her tone is so neutral that it\u2019s hard to gauge her sincerity. She hurries away.\nThe three of us continue to eat in silence for a few minutes. Mannheim appears profoundly haunted and troubled. Eventually he says, \u201cI need to confess something. I\u2019m privy to a terrible secret. It\u2019s why I\u2019m travelling to Constantinople.\u201d\nYusuf and I exchange another glance. Stepping out of my assumed persona, I say, with all the sincerity I can muster, \u201cWe, too, believe in peace.\u201d\n\u201cI belong to this covert organization called the Invisible Fingers. A cabal of privileged men and women who think the world is their playground. They \u2014 we \u2014 are behind this war. And now they\u2019re planning bombings and shootings in both Istanbul and Constantinople to provoke a declaration of war between the Communities and the Emirates. I\u2019ve been a vocal opponent to this entire war business, but I\u2019m a lone voice within the Fingers. The time has come for me to expose the group and perhaps begin the process toward peace, if it\u2019s not too late. For now, I need to warn the authorities in the twin cities to prevent yet more wholesale slaughter in the name of profit.\u201d\nI tell him, \u201cThere may be another agent of the Fingers aboard this train.\u201d And we take him into our confidence.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nYusuf reluctantly agrees: Sandrine Madec is most likely working for the Invisible Fingers. Although there\u2019s the possibility that the true agent perished along with my brother on the northern line, and I still harbour a suspicion that the agent might be Yusuf himself. But my gut tells me no. Or perhaps it is my emotions. I am still grieving \u00c9douard, and Yusuf\u2019s warm camaraderie has been a soothing balm.\n\u201cWe might try to follow her in Constantinople, effendi, but it would be very easy for her to lose a tail in the labyrinthine metropolis. Especially if she suspects that we suspect her.\u201d\nA scream pre-empts my response.\nWe hurry from my berth and follow the commotion, which focuses on Mannheim\u2019s cabin in the next car. There\u2019s quite a lot of blood. His. And Sandrine Madec\u2019s. Knives plunged in each other\u2019s necks. The angle of the bodies is all wrong, though. This was staged. It can\u2019t be Yusuf \u2014 he\u2019s been with me for nearly an hour.\nI push my way in \u2014 nearly everyone on the train is huddled in the corridor \u2014 boasting of an authority I do not possess. I need to examine the evidence before too much is tampered with. I notice the bottle of wine. I find the cork. The corkscrew failed to completely hide the needle mark. Poison.\nHow stupid I\u2019ve been.\nBefore my presence is challenged I hurry out, grabbing Yusuf and whispering that Mannheim and Madec were murdered by a third party. \u201cI know who the agent is,\u201d I inform him. \u201cWe have to plan how to capture her at Constantinople.\u201d\n\u201cHer, effendi? But Sandrine is dead.\u201d There\u2019s deep sorrow in his voice. She\u2019d touched him more than he\u2019d admitted to himself.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know if she was an innocent, or yet another player who got in the way of the Invisible Fingers.\u201d\n\u201cBut who, then?\u201d\n\u201cWho said the agent had to be a passenger?\u201d I turn to look at him as I slide open the door to my berth. Yusuf knocks me to the ground. A bullet grazes my bicep. Before she can again take aim with her silent airgun, Yusuf lunges at Magali, our Occitan porter.\nShe overpowers my friend. Ignoring the blood oozing from my arm, I charge at her. But she fires again. The bullet takes part of my ear with it. Yusuf is up again. He knocks the gun away and grabs her neck with both his hands. He has her on the floor. Soon, he\u2019s strangled the life out of her.\nYusuf\u2019s face is wet with tears. \u201cYusuf, go away now. I\u2019ll take responsibility for this. You can\u2019t be seen here. It\u2019ll compromise your plans. Go. Stop the Invisible Fingers. Save the twin cities. Save Byzantium.\u201d\nHe nods and says only, \u201cEffendi. You are a brother to me.\u201d\n\u201cOne last thing\u2026\u201d I tell him how to contact my fellow agent on the platform. I\u2019m going to need extraction. Then, when I\u2019m recovered from the bullet wounds, I\u2019ll seek out my new brother.

Fuqua\nLynne, my wife, had convinced me to take a couple of weeks \u201cpaternal leave,\u201d as she called it, then a few more weeks away from editors and deadlines to perform desperately needed home repairs before she returned to her job, our real income, leaving daytime baby care to me. Rotted eaves and siding, faded and chipped paint inside and out, two holes in the back fence \u2014 I needed help, cheap help. I would\u2019ve hired a high school kid, but then I saw this guy beside the road.\nThe brown dog perked its ears but no one made a move until the old man stuffed his sign into one of the bags and stood to greet me. The man snapped his fingers, and the dogs jumped into the truck bed. He tossed his bags in back and crawled into the cab, setting the metal box gingerly between us, his hand resting protectively on top. William O'Leary grunted \u201cNorthern Ireland\u201d to my first question. \u201cNear Donegal Bay.\u201d I asked him why he'd come to America. \u201cLand of missed opportunity,\u201d he said in a raspy brogue. \u201cHomeless of the free, grave of the brave.\u201d\nI took the hint and limited conversation to chores. He responded to every request quickly, efficiently, better than I expected, thanks to perceptions perpetuated by media and politicians. At sundown the first day, he waited beside the truck, his dogs in back where they'd maintained a patient vigil throughout the day. He'd fed and watered them during the only two breaks he'd taken, fishing out dry food from one of the bags.\nI opened my wallet. \u201cJust enough for something to eat,\u201d he said, \u201cand to get my dogs a bite.\u201d\nI handed him thirty bucks; his work had been worth twice that. He pushed my hand back, his eyes, exhausted and wise beyond grief, met mine for a moment. \u201cTake it,\u201d I insisted.\nHe shook his head. \u201cJust enough for my food and the dogs.\u201d I shrugged, spread the bills in my hand. He took one ten, folding it neatly, hooking it into his pocket.\n\u201cCan you work a few more days?\u201d I asked. He agreed with a nod. \u201cGet in,\u201d I said, planning to ferry him back to the place where I'd found him that morning, but he gave a sharp, short whistle, and the dogs hopped out of the truck.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be here first thing,\u201d he said. \u201cJust be getting my box now.\u201d He hesitated, and I remembered the metal box locked securely inside the cab. I unlocked the door; he wedged in before me, pulled the box from the seat and tucked it under his arm. He walked away quickly, the dogs forming a line behind him, tongues dangling happily. He glanced back as Lynne opened the front door and Beccah let out a cry. I looked at my watch and grimaced. Right on time, five o'clock. Beccah would cry from now until around ten when she'd abruptly stop, magically, and sleep through the night in three-hour shifts. Colic.\nWilliam arrived shortly after dawn the following day and worked until sunset. Every day, he arrived early, worked hard, left at sundown, metal box safely underarm, his dogs trailing happily behind. And he never accepted more than ten dollars for a day\u2019s work. I felt guilty for not paying more, but glad he wouldn\u2019t take it because it allowed me to keep him on longer.\nBy Thursday afternoon, we'd replaced all the rotted eaves and siding and were laying on the second coat of exterior paint when I glanced around just as William tumbled from the ladder\u2019s top step, falling some six feet. He landed solidly on his back, knocking out the air. He rolled onto his side, groaning, his withered face pinched in pain. I rushed over as he struggled to sit up. He forced a grin, the first since I'd met him. I knelt beside him, helped him to sit.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, laddie,\u201d he wheezed. \u201cFine.\u201d\nThat afternoon I offered him a ride as usual, and this time he accepted, climbing into the cab, the metal box between us. I backed out of the driveway, shifted into first, and was about to disengage the clutch when I heard scratching from inside the box. I looked over at William, expectantly, but he offered no explanation. \u201cIt\u2019s none of my business,\u201d I began.\n\u201cThat'd be right.\u201d\n\u201che\u2019s an old man,\u201d Lynne had said the day before, \u201cno job, no home, no family. And he\u2019s probably a little off.\u201d William had been spreading paint on the window outside Beccah\u2019s bedroom. Her peered in at the four-week-old child.\n\u201cBest you be protecting her.\u201d\nI turned to him, curious. \u201cI do my best.\u201d\n\u201cThere be things,\u201d he said, then shook his head and returned to his painting.\n\u201cThings?\u201d I asked.\nHe had glanced over at me, pity in his eyes for the young fool. \u201cBest to be careful,\u201d he said solemnly and left it at that.\nI let my question about the box go, slipped my foot off the clutch, accelerated. He directed me down the Parkway, the city\u2019s primary north\/south route, to where it passes over Governors Drive. I pulled over near the intersection on the concrete shoulder under the Parkway overpass. He opened the door, slid out, grimacing with pain as he reached back for the box. Again, scratching. He paused before closing the door, nodded at the box. \u201cYou want to know,\u201d he said. \u201cIt'd be a pet from home, and it\u2019s hungry.\u201d\nI nodded, but didn\u2019t ask the obvious: What kind of pet would be kept in a metal box? \u201cI\u2019ll pick you up here in the morning,\u201d I said, and he closed the door. The dogs jumped out to follow. He waved to another man, a friend by the name of Baker Thomas, I'd learn later. As I watched the old man limp away, hurt more than he'd admitted, I noticed several other men, all raggedly dressed, unkempt, invisible unless you looked specifically for them, doing the best with what they had, settling in for the night \u2014 their roof, a highway overpass; their bed, a piece of dirt or concrete beside a drainage ditch.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHe acknowledged me with a nod as I made my way down the embankment, skirting over the low concrete barrier into the home of the homeless. Tattered jeans and snagged sweaters lay stretched on the sloping concrete sides of the drainage ditch, drying. Five or so men milled about, speaking softly among themselves. One suddenly pointed toward the highway, and I glanced around, found a policeman getting out of his cruiser.\nI asked Baker what was going on, but he didn\u2019t answer as the officer approached us. The policeman asked me why I was there, and, after explaining, I followed him and Baker into the drainage ditch and walked some forty yards north to the point where the overpass sloped sharply down. A well-worn path led from the ditch into the cavelike space under the overpass, a clearance of four feet. Three of William\u2019s dogs scampered out and scattered, but I didn\u2019t see the brown one anywhere. I called to the others, but they tucked tails and ran.\n\u201cIn there,\u201d Baker said, pointing into the darkness. The policeman bent low. I followed, leaving Baker behind, puffy hands shoved into pockets of pants two sizes too small. I took two steps in, stopped short, straightening by reflex, banging my head on the underside of the overpass, cobwebs tangling around my ears and face. I doubled, turning away, retching raisin bran and milk, then bile. Behind me lay the remains of William O'Leary, his belly ripped open from crotch to sternum. The metal box lay nearby, open and spattered with blood. The officer looked everything over, then dismissed the box completely.\nI came out of William\u2019s \u201chome\u201d lightheaded and nauseated, the box tucked underarm the same way William had carried it. Baker had already lumbered back to the drainage ditch. He glanced over his shoulder, his eyes lingering a moment on the box before he dropped into the ditch and hurried back to the intersection where his buddies waited. The officer emerged a few minutes later, resting his hands on his hips.\n\u201cProbably a fight over booze.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he drank,\u201d I said.\n\u201che\u2019s an Irishman, ain\u2019t he?\u201d\nI looked away.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll talk to these people, ask the standard questions, and,\u201d he sighed, \u201cthat\u2019ll be that.\u201d\nI could have protested, should have, but the officer would have lectured me about the department\u2019s more important role in society, protecting taxpayers, writing traffic tickets. One bum more or less was nothing to get excited about.\nWhen I reached the intersection, Baker had disappeared. I returned to my truck, placed the box on the seat. With the officer finished with me, I turned the ignition key, slipped the truck into first, and started away only to stop abruptly, startled by a heavy thump in back. William\u2019s brown dog wagged his tail and stared in through the glass. I knew Lynne would be thrilled, but I couldn\u2019t leave it behind for the catcher. Had the other dogs come when I called, I would\u2019ve brought them home too.\nThe dog immediately quelled Lynne\u2019s potential protests by nuzzling as if on cue. That night, the dog slept inside. The next morning when I rose, it was gone, let out by Lynne, I assumed.\nI dressed, started out to finish the painting, sorely aware of William\u2019s absence. I retrieved William\u2019s box from the truck, washed the blood off, and stored it in the utility room where it would have stayed had I never seen the rat in Beccah\u2019s room.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAs unexpectedly as it appeared, it disappeared, but I could hear it, scratching and scurrying in the attic and walls. I set up traps, but they caught nothing.\nIn the meantime, Beccah\u2019s colic vanished, replaced by a nagging cough that quickly mutated into a hack that kept her awake most of the time. She grew drawn, pale and weak, but the doctor could not pinpoint the cause. She checked Beccah for viral infections, pneumonia, common cold, a hundred different bugs and ailments, but the cough and deteriorating condition eluded diagnosis.\nA month passed, and Beccah\u2019s condition finally stabilized as we pumped in antibiotics and food, both breast milk and formula, even though she fought the feedings. We brought her into our bed, placing her between us to sleep, until one night when, dead tired after countless hours of feeding and fretting, I nearly rolled back on her. A friend of mine, an artist who\u2019s illustrated a couple of my stories, told me about a woman he worked with. She and her husband had brought their infant boy to bed with them. The father, a heavy sleeper, had rolled onto his son and smothered him. Afraid I might do the same to Beccah, we put her back in her crib and switched on the crib monitor, turning the volume to maximum, checking on her whenever she made the slightest noise.\nLynne sleeps more soundly than I, which explains why she didn\u2019t awaken shortly after three the second night after Beccah returned to her crib. I raised up, rubbing my eyes. Imagination? The monitor hissed white noise. I lay my head down, then bolted upright as the monitor went dead. My bare feet sank into the four year-old carpet as I made my way toward the dim night light bleeding from Beccah\u2019s room into the hall. Halfway there, the light vanished. I broke into a run, froze in Beccah\u2019s doorway, paralyzed by fear.\nIt looked slowly around at me, its head, a huge cephalopod, tiny arms writhing around the mouth, eyes blazing red in the darkness, taunting. The beads of red narrowed as the cephalopod reformed into a wolf\u2019s head. It howled laughter, rearing back, its penis erect.\nBeccah! my mind screamed. For a flashing instant, I saw something in the crib that was not my daughter, a hideous creature, gaunt, gray, with the same deathly, taunting glare as the devil beside the crib. A blink, and the image was gone, and my daughter was coughing and squirming in her own private agony, her mouth opened to cry.\nI lunged for the half-wolf, half-man, but it moved quicker than any human I\u2019ve ever seen, sidestepping me, squealing delight as it began to melt into itself, reshaping, standing momentarily on its hind legs before dropping into William O'Leary\u2019s brown dog. I dove for it, but, again, it moved with uncanny agility, darting into the hallway, changing as it fled. By the time it reached the living room hearth, it had transformed into a snake that raced over the carpet and slithered into the closet and up the phone wire, into the attic through the small hole left by the phone installer. I closed the door, my chest pounding. I switched on the living room light, the hall light, and Beccah\u2019s room light, trembling. Insanity? I leaned over the crib rails, staring down at my daughter. Her cries had stopped, and she slept soundly now, her breaths rapid, but even. Lynne, dishevelled and with sleep-swollen eyes, appeared in the doorway, scratching her scalp. She yawned deeply. \u201cI thought I heard her crying.\u201d\n\u201cJust a dream,\u201d I said. A nightmare.\n\u201cWhat were you laughing at?\u201d she asked, eyes half-closed.\nI recalled the creature\u2019s obscene howl and shivered. \u201cJust your dream.\u201d\nShe nodded sleepily. \u201cWant me to stay up?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll feed her. Can\u2019t sleep anyway.\u201d And she was gone.\nI sat on the floor between the crib and changing table, legs cocked up, arms on my knees, head on my arms, mind clouded by uncertainty, self-doubt, fear of something I did not understand. I knew that Lynne was safe in our room. The thing I'd seen in Beccah\u2019s room wanted her, not my wife, not me. Thoughts collided, faded, and I began to drift toward sleep. Near dawn I sensed movement in Beccah\u2019s doorway. I opened my eyes, stunned, immobile. William O'Leary wore a good-natured grin, his face softer than I remembered.\n\u201cAh, laddie,\u201d the old man said. He glanced into the crib. \u201cKill it now, while there\u2019s time.\u201d He looked back at me, his face pallid, eyes pink and watery. \u201cThe box.\u201d The image wavered, backed into the hallway.\nI found my strength, charged the doorway, O'Leary, Lynne.\nShe staggered back, fear in her eyes as O'Leary\u2019s image faded. I reached for Lynne, drew her close. \u201cI'm sorry,\u201d I whispered. \u201cA dream. A bad dream.\u201d\n\u201cHow long have you been in here?\u201d\n\u201cSince three, when you got up.\u201d\nShe pulled back. \u201cI\u2019ve been up tonight?\u201d\nI smiled. \u201cThe monitor went dead, so I came to check.\u201d I wasn\u2019t about to mention the creature. \u201cYou came in, and I told you to go back to bed. I fed her, decided to stay.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t even remember.\u201d A soothing hand came to my cheek, caressing. \u201cYou okay? You\u2019re pale.\u201d\nI drew a deep breath, smiled for her, kissed her quickly, said, \u201cTired, but I\u2019ve still got a lot of work to do.\u201d Dawn light bled in through the blinds. \u201cAnd I should get busy. Maybe I should get William\u2019s friend to help me.\u201d\n\u201cYou think that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d she asked. \u201cAfter all that\u2019s happened?\u201d\nEspecially after all that\u2019s happened.\nI kissed her on the forehead, and, while she settled in the rocking chair to feed Beccah, I retrieved William\u2019s metal box from the utility room, set it in the truck seat. Twenty minutes later, I arrived at the overpass and pulled off near the place where William had lived and died. I found Baker gathering his belongings into a sack. When he saw me crossing the drainage culvert to the concrete island where he made his bed, he fled in the opposite direction, leaving his belongings behind. His pace quickened. \u201cI want no part of it,\u201d he shouted over the roar of cars on the overpass.\nI ran after him, grabbed him by the shoulder, turning him. \u201cPart of what?\u201d\nHe jerked free.\nI filled my fists with his collar, yanked him close \u2014 this lightweight manhandling a heavyweight as if I had the means to back myself up. \u201cMy daughter\u2026 this morning\u2026\u201d I let him go, turned away. Even before I said it, it sounded preposterous.\nHe touched my arm, gently.\n\u201cWhat was in the box?\u201d I muttered.\nBaker sighed. \u201cCome on.\u201d He led me back to the place where he'd discovered William\u2019s body. He bent in low, and I followed, reluctantly. The stench of death hung heavy in the stale air. He pointed to a space with no more than a foot clearance. Traffic thundered overhead. I crept closer, saw vague movement as maggots writhed in the bloated stomach of a brown dog, William\u2019s dog. I stumbled back into the light.\n\u201cThat one you took with you,\u201d Baker said, head bowed, hands in pockets, \u201cit weren\u2019t no dog.\u201d\nI felt faint.\nWe sat in the drainage ditch, away from traffic. \u201cFaeries,\u201d he said.\n\u201cRight,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t need jokes.\u201d\n\u201cI make no jokes. They exist, and we pay the devil for it. There are tithes to hell and the need to revitalize bloodlines.\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t Ireland. Just tell me what was in the damn box.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s your daughter?\u201d he asked calmly.\nI looked away.\n\u201cSickly?\u201d\nI met his gaze, waiting.\nBaker\u2019s eyes grew dark and sad with knowledge. \u201cThey leave a changeling, one that usually dies, but if it lives, it will always be sickly.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no changeling\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know. It would look like the child.\u201d\nThat flashing instant when I came into the doorway the night before\u2026 . No, my senses railed.\n\u201cWilliam\u2019s box,\u201d he said, \u201chis father fashioned it in the eighteen-nineties, from iron, for the phooka.\u201d\n\u201cThe what?\u201d\n\u201cPhooka,\u201d he replied evenly. \u201cA trickster. Some claim he\u2019s the devil himself. It killed William\u2019s grandfather before William\u2019s father was able to catch it. It\u2019s been in that box ever since. Nothing else can hold it.\u201d\n\u201cThen how'd it escape?\u201d I asked, skeptical.\nHe rubbed his stubbled chin. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I do know it killed William, just like it killed his grandfather.\u201d\nI recalled the scraping and tapping from within the box. \u201cIf you\u2019re telling the truth, and my daughter has been stolen, why\u2019s the phooka still there?\u201d\nBaker shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s been in that box an awful long time.\u201d He paused, then asked, \u201cYou have a fireplace?\u201d\nI nodded, feeling cold, numb.\n\u201cBuild a fire, a roaring fire,\u201d Baker said. He slipped his hand into the faded windbreaker he wore, pulled out a crudely-made knife, the blade rusting and jagged.\nI looked at the knife, then into his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re going to help me with this, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cAin\u2019t my fight.\u201d He held the knife out to me. \u201cThe blade\u2019s iron. It was William's. It won\u2019t kill that thing in your baby\u2019s bed, but it\u2019ll slow it down long enough for you to do what you have to.\u201d He placed the knife into my palm, and my fingers closed around it.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cPigeons,\u201d I told Lynne, \u201cgetting in through a hole in the vent.\u201d I left for the hardware store, saying I'd buy some wire to repair the vent, but instead I bought a garden hose, a combination padlock and several straw brooms, cutting off the straw, as Baker had instructed. That night, with Lynne soundly asleep, I dressed with my clothes turned inside out. As I pulled on my T-shirt, I heard a hushed giggle from Beccah\u2019s room. My mouth went dry, throat gritty as salt.\nI eased quietly down the hall \u2014 in one hand, broom straw; in the other, the iron blade knife. I lay the knife on the carpet beside the door and stepped into the doorway. A goat-headed demon towered on Beccah\u2019s changing table next to the crib. It dropped to its knees, cackling laughter, masturbating wildly, a stream of rusty, acrid semen streaming over the rail, splattering Beccah. I scattered the straw and slammed the door shut. From within, a scream of anger and hatred. I raced to the living room, flung open the fireplace doors, lit the paper around the three wax-and-wood chip logs I'd already set up.\nA shriek of damnation.\nMy mind raced with what I still needed to do.\nLynne emerged from our room, racing to Beccah\u2019s door, her hand going to the knob. I grabbed her wrist as another scream sounded from within, this one different, this one from Beccah. Lynne fought against me as I backed her into the bathroom. \u201cIt isn\u2019t Beccah!\u201d I shouted at her.\n\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d she cried. She kicked at me, my grip tightening.\nI pulled her out of the bathroom, down the hallway, through the living room and kitchen, into the back yard where I finally released her. She bolted for the door, but I pushed her away. Beccah screamed again. I held Lynne\u2019s wrist with one hand and grabbed the water hose sprayer with the other. Ready, I pushed Lynne aside and dragged the hose into the house. I retrieved William\u2019s iron box from the bathroom and readied myself.\n\u201cHave you lost your mind?\u201d Lynne rushed up to Beccah\u2019s door. I sprayed her with the water hose as she reached for the doorknob, forcing her back. I dropped the hose and box, grabbed her by the shoulders.\n\u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake, Lynne!\u201d Softer, \u201cFor Beccah's sake.\u201d My voice cracked. Her horrified eyes searched mine, unable to comprehend, certain that I had gone mad. Then she heard the growl in Beccah\u2019s room, followed by a long, heinous yowl.\n\u201cDear God.\u201d She began to tremble.\n\u201cWhen I tell you, throw the door open and get the hell out of the way.\u201d She nodded dumbly, set herself by the door as I took position with the hose and iron box.\n\u201cRunning water, broom straw, iron, crucifixes, clothes turned inside out \u2014 don\u2019t ask me why, I don\u2019t know, but they work.\u201d\n\u201cNow!\u201d\nThe door flung open, and I threw the box into the room. It landed with the lid slapping shut. The phooka reared its head and bellowed, its eyes gleaming. It charged, horns down, as I aimed and opened the sprayer full force, blasting it squarely in the chest. It squealed and fell back, clamoring at the window blinds. I gaped as it appeared to shrink in the spray. It shrieked again as the blinds fell, its eyes filled with terror of the large crucifix I'd taped to the middle pane. It stumbled back, and I sprayed again, spinning the bastard into the far corner, keeping myself between it and the doorway.\nI edged inside, reached down for the iron box, flipped open the lid. I glanced away for only a moment, but long enough for the phooka to spring high above the spray. It landed inside the crib and immediately sank from sight.\n\u201cBeccah!\u201d Lynne shouted. I reached the crib with her. Two Beccah's, each identical, lay inside.\nI backed into the doorway, hose held ready, aimed at the crib as I picked up the knife.\n\u201cNo!\u201d Lynne shouted. Before she could act, I raised the knife, plunged it down. It sank with a sick, wet sound into the child\u2019s chest. Tears blinded me as the other Beccah began to bubble and transform into a wriggling white larva, donned with our daughter\u2019s face, grinning wickedly, the body sprouting moth\u2019s wings. It laughed hideously as the wings flapped.\nFalling backward, I squeezed the sprayer with all my strength. The creature tumbled to the floor, rolling with the power of the spray toward the iron box. I dropped the hose, dove, my hands wrapping around the winged creature. It writhed against my grasp, and I could feel it changing. I scrambled, crammed it into the metal box and slammed the lid shut, locking it with the combination padlock. It howled from within.\nI rushed back to the crib as Lynne reached for the wounded child. I pushed her aside, lifted the baby, and fled with her to the living room, Lynne crying behind me, \u201cPlease, don\u2019t hurt her again. Please\u2026 .\u201d The words choked off as I flung the bleeding infant, knife and all, into the fire. I will never forget the wail, the squeals of torment, the chilling howls as the changeling rose on the flames.\nLynne collapsed to her knees, staring into the fire, speechless, tears streaming from her eyes. I knelt beside her. Finally, she looked over at me, and I took her into my arms, her face against my chest. \u201cBeccah?\u201d she croaked. I held her tighter.\nBy dawn, I was resting with my back against the couch with Lynne before the fire, staring unblinkingly into the flickering light.\nA muffled cry, hungry, alone.\nWe raced to the door, pulled it open. Beccah lay on the porch, wrapped in the same receiving blanket we'd brought her home in.\nI sealed off Beccah\u2019s room as she and Lynne settled in our bed, Beccah suckling at Lynne\u2019s breast. I gathered a handful of straw that lay scattered in the hallway and stroked it over Beccah\u2019s back \u2014 no reaction. The weight of dread and defeat lifted as I lay down and watched my family slowly, peacefully, slip into sleep. I drifted off sometime later and slept soundly into the afternoon.\nI returned to the Parkway overpass at Governors early the following morning, the iron box and its prisoner in hand, but Baker wasn\u2019t there. \u201cDon\u2019t spect him back,\u201d one of the others said. \u201cIt ain\u2019t like we live in the Ritz here.\u201d\nWe\u2019ve decided to sell our house, though we have no reason to fear the occasional demon here any more than someplace else. I'm not sure why they, whoever they are, returned Beccah (Did they expect a trade?), but at least she\u2019s home. She still has bouts with colic, but we do not mind that at all. In every other respect, she\u2019s healthy. As for the phooka, I suppose I could toss its box into the river, but somehow, I'm sure, the bastard would escape. For now, I keep it in the utility room, locked away, hidden in a corner, but never out of mind. When I need tools or when I shed the lawn mower, the phooka, hungry for freedom, scratches steadily, but never desperately. Sometimes, I drop table scraps into the box through a small hatch, but even if I never fed it, I'm sure the phooka would survive. You cannot destroy a devil.\nIn late night, after the neighborhood has settled and sirens sometimes whine in the distance, if I listen closely, I can hear the phooka\u2019s resolute breathing. Its eyes glow like drops of blood in my mind as spindly fingers toy with its ragged genitalia. Then the eyes narrow. The phooka grins with eternal patience.\n\u2022\n\u00a9 2000 C.S.

I give them a home, the kittens grow into cats. I paint them for inspiration, white canvas, I sneak up on them when they\u2019re sleeping and paint them. It\u2019s so clich\u00e9 it fits just perfectly. There\u2019s a primal vibration in their purring sleep. It reminds me of Freud\u2019s dream analysis.\nI dream of two kittens, better than these. The old ones become orphans of neglect. Two kittens better than these and I am nothing but prejudice to the ones less beautiful \u2014 ugly adult cats that have lost their kitten innocence. The whiskers have grown and the playfulness has died with age.\nI stroke the gray in my hair as I paint. \u201cYou are a lazy cat,\u201d I say. It opens its eyes and fits the role, barely giving me the time of day. For the first time I look at the knife rack hanging above the sink. The glint catches my eye, and a shudder like soft purring runs up my leg, and with personal embarrassment I realize I\u2019ve wet myself. I could swear I see the cat smile before closing its eyes and going back to sleep.\nI dream what they dream. It doesn\u2019t take long for me to realize this. They see the knife rack in my eyes. It\u2019s the feline knowingness, the cunning of the cat\u2019s mind. Everyone can feel it when a cat gazes into your eyes. I sleep less and they sleep more as the cashier at the pharmacy raises an eyebrow at the amount of paint and canvases I\u2019ve been buying lately.\n\u201cYou are a busy man,\u201d the male says to me late one night.\n\u201cI thought you were sleeping,\u201d I reply. I\u2019ve been startled and my heavy eyes raise a fraction of a millimeter. \u201cYou two are so beautiful when you sleep.\u201d\n\u201cLike none other,\u201d I hear the female purr from somewhere beneath the couch.\n\u201cThere is always better,\u201d I mutter under my breath as I continue to paint. This will be my first time depicting their open eyes.\n\u201cQuite the artist you must be,\u201d the cashier says to me. She\u2019s in her forties and well on her way to growing a mustache.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that.\u201d I give the old modest shrug. Aww, shucks. I eye something behind the counter. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cAn electronic filet knife. Makes the job easier. My husband uses one to clean the fish he catches.\u201d\nI wonder if the saying is true, there is only one way to skin a cat.\nIt\u2019s the fur. It\u2019s becoming coarse and losing its beauty. What little sleep I get is plagued with the dreams of finding new kittens on my doorstep. They look up at me, so young yet already so wise. They have a sharpness to their eyes that cuts through you like a knife. An electronic filet knife.\nEach day I wake up to the fact that there are no new kittens waiting for me on my doorstep. Each day I wake up to the fact that the two cats, brother and sister, are growing and losing the soft appeal to their fur. I no longer pet them because the repulsive feeling I get now when I do makes me want to vomit. There is only paint and the calluses growing on my fingers. It is one of these days that I realize I haven\u2019t given them names.\n\u201cMarty,\u201d the male says to me. I come back from whatever daydream I\u2019ve been lost in.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cMy name is Marty,\u201d the cat says, impatient. \u201cAnd my sister\u2019s name is Trisha. When you were off in la la land, your boss called and left a message on the machine. You\u2019re fired.\u201d\nHow sad. I worked for almost twenty years at the factory. I first started with manning the machines working minimum wage when I was a teenager. After graduating from college they hired me as an accountant. Numbers were just about the only thing I was good at. I wasn\u2019t exactly the brightest crayon in the box, and that includes my personality. No close friends. No wife. No future goals. You start to wonder sometimes on your lunch breaks what it all means. You walk in and see pictures of your boss\u2019s kids on his desk. You wonder what it\u2019s like to hold a baby in your arms, to watch it grow up and teach it how to play nice and all the other things you teach little kids.\nThe cats don\u2019t play nice, they don\u2019t even play at all. With a quick flick of the hand I send the paint supplies flying off the table as tears start to run silently down my cheeks. The cap to one of them comes open and the red paint slowly spreads into a puddle on the floor. Blood red paint, I can almost see my reflection in it. With the aura of someone noticing things outside of my body, I detect a dull throb in my hand. I display my palm for my eyes to see and notice for the first time that I\u2019ve been digging my nails (I haven\u2019t trimmed them in weeks) into the soft vulnerable skin just above my lifeline. A few droplets of blood drip onto the table. Within seconds Trisha springs up from her sleeping place and begins to lick vigorously at the blood on the table. Marty just opens one eye and smiles, and as I flee from the kitchen I can visualize Trisha pausing from her licking long enough to look up and smile as well.\nWhen I was eighteen one of the workers at the shoe factory cut off part of his finger. It was the index finger on his right hand. I had been spraying down one of the rubber belts in line one when I heard the screaming. Inside the large factory it echoed and gave you the impression that more than one person was yelling. Someone hit the emergency stop button, the red one next to the terminal room, and all the belts shut off.\nI didn\u2019t know the guy. In fact I didn\u2019t know too many of the people who worked there, but I rushed to him just like everyone else, more out of curiosity than concern. We found him in line three leaning against the wall, his right hand clenched into his left with his gloves starting to turn a scarlet red. With great reluctance, he gave out his hand to one of the workers for inspection. Slowly, the man stripped off the now-red glove and exposed the hand for all of us to see.\nIt wasn\u2019t just cut, the machine had done a number on it. From the last joint it had been sliced clean off, removing almost a centimeter of the finger, but for the length that was still intact the machine had managed to rip the skin clear from it. It was almost as if a surgeon had gone at it with the motive of removing just the skin while leaving the finger still there. It was amazing.\nI tiptoe through my own house at three o\u2019clock in the morning as if it isn\u2019t mine. I feel like a trespasser on my own property. The moonlight coming through the windows reflects off the shiny bit of metal in my hand. I\u2019ve paid a recent trip to the store and made an investment just in case I ever have some fish to clean.\nEvery creak, every step sounds like a cacophony of thunder in my own ears. Cats are the lightest of sleepers it seems and the sounds I\u2019m making would have woken up my near-deaf father if he were still alive. In the darkness my thumb roles over the switch that turns on the knife. I made sure to buy the cordless one.\nThey sleep in the kitchen, convenient for my painting. I can\u2019t remember the last time I used the table for eating. In the faint light I can see empty Chinese food boxes and the kitchen smells faintly of old pizza. My heightened senses allow me to hear the purring of the two cats as they sleep. I can almost make out their shadows in the corner of the room.\nThe man at the factory, I didn\u2019t know his name but I was amazed at how the skin was taken from his fingers. I woke up this morning with the saying there is only one way to skin a cat running through my head. It\u2019s the kitten fur, it\u2019s almost gone, replaced by the coarse fur of an adult. Both of the felines are at that brink of time, switching from kittens to adults. The beauty of kitten fur is almost gone, and from the looks of it I won\u2019t be getting any new kittens on my doorstep anytime soon.\nIt is these two cats. Two cats that mock me. I\u2019m almost forty times their age and they mock me. They use big words I could never understand and sometimes I get up late at night and pull out my Oxford English Dictionary because I just can\u2019t get the words out of my mind. I went to college for four years and two animals that aren\u2019t supposed to talk make me feel like an idiot. And I want their fur. I want to be able to sit on my bed and just rub my face in it like how people buy their mink fur coats and just rub their hands through them.\nI bring the knife from my side and hold it up, pausing across the kitchen, looking at their sleeping bodies. They\u2019re still small for cats, Trisha the smaller of the two.\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s Marty who opens his eyes and ruins it. I can see the glow of the moonlight shinning off his eyes as he lifts up his head and looks. My heart stops in my chest and I almost drop the knife onto to the floor.\n\u201cThere are worse deaths than being skinned alive,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are worse ways of living.\u201d\nI can\u2019t even find the voice to speak, much less breath. The two glowing eyes look at me without blinking, piercing through the darkness and honing in on only me, a shadow in the corner of the room. I feel warm urine running down my leg.\n\u201cI smell your piss.\u201d He puts his head back down. \u201cYou disgust me.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I disgust myself.\nI fall asleep and dream. No new kittens, no new fur, just the satisfaction of being able to skin these cats alive. It\u2019s gruesome in its cruelty but I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t consider myself a violent person but for Marty and Trisha I\u2019d like to make an exception. I\u2019d like to take away the words and the fancy language of the cats, to make the purrs turn into shivers of death, straight from a horror novel.\nI wake up with a smile on face for the first time.\nBoth cats are on my chest. Marty raises up one of his paws and I can see the claws coming out. He brings it down and punctures my right eye.\nTrisha does the same to my left.\nI am immediately blind and screaming, and I rise up, not even noticing as the cats jump from my chest and I run screaming into the walls. There are canvases everywhere, leaning and hanging on the walls, littering the floor for me to blindly trip over them. I must have spent hundreds of dollars on useless art supplies so I could paint the same thing over and over again.\nTwo kittens. Two sleeping kittens that a person would find cute at first glance, but after going through a few of my paintings would eventually grow bored. Dozens and dozens of paintings.\nNone of which I will ever see again.\nThere is only one way to skin a cat, but no way to skin two kittens.\nThere are no kittens better than these, none that I will ever see.\n\u2022\n\u00a9 2003 Simon Owens, all rights reserved","source":null,"source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/3a0q7VyAjoIcXJFc+gXvvLRgSvk.json"}

This is a pure trip. Just two bloods commingling. Any impurities will stop Atlas from getting inside you.\u201d\nStewart didn\u2019t answer. He was too distracted by all the naked couples. The attic floor was covered with bodies, lying belly to swollen belly on bedbug-blackened box springs. Their arms were thrust out above their heads, ears resting on their biceps; they clasped hands like lovers, each couple\u2019s circulatory systems knitted into a single bloodstream.\nStewart felt his arms itch where the needles would be inserted, anticipation and fear churning into a sour mix in his gut. But Tina was ready, as she always was for things like this. She\u2019d dragged him here, telling him they had to do this now, before they outlawed consanguination just like they\u2019d outlawed LSD.\nShe stared up at Ryan with adoration as he strung the wiring above them with efficient motions. Her breath came in excited hitches.\nThough his girlfriend was dry-humping Ryan with her eyes, Stewart took satisfaction in the way Ryan refused to look back. Ryan had wanted to take her to Atlas, but Tina had insisted her boyfriend should be her first time. And Stewart had gone along with it \u2014 because if he didn\u2019t, Ryan would.\nOnce you\u2019d exchanged the most vital bodily fluid, Stewart thought, sex was almost an afterthought. That must be why the consanguinated fucked so much. But Tina kept insisting this wasn\u2019t about sex \u2014 it was about hooking into a greater consciousness.\nStewart couldn\u2019t bear to watch Tina watching Ryan, so instead Stewart turned away to watch the other veiners. Plastic tubes sprouted from the arteries at the crooks of their elbows, in the hollows of their necks, at the backs of their legs, the tubes arcing up above them to rest on wire hangers. The corkscrew tubes, threaded with crimson, looked like some bizarre moonshiner\u2019s still.\nThe tubes twitched with every heartbeat, ferrying blood between the bodies. Thick needles rooted in desiccated flesh. Erratic bursts of staticky whalesong-sounds blared down from speakers bungee-corded to the ceiling. Some made love slowly, thrusting their hips in time to the beat. Almost all the women were in the early stages of pregnancy. But most, girl or boy, just lay naked and insensate with ecstasy.\nStewart found it hard to look away. Before Tina had taken his virginity in Roeville Cemetery, he\u2019d never seen a naked person in the flesh, let alone a room of them. Each couple\u2019s skin was mottled with hives; bruises pooled across their backs with each breath, darkening into blue-black splotches.\nLight glimmered in the depths of those splotches. Streaming nebulae floated into view, glowing in translucent neon.\nStewart pulled away. Tina gasped, reaching out to touch the wonderment, but Ryan stopped her with a tolerant smile.\nStewart knew Atlas made you trip, but \u2014 you had to get hooked up first, didn\u2019t you? He had no experience with hallucinations. He shook his head, yet the sight remained: the veiners had patches of outer space drifting across their backs , flecked with stars, like lights viewed through deep ocean waves\n\u201cI said,\u201d Ryan repeated, directing all his irritation at Stewart, \u201cDid you take any drugs before you came here?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never even done pot.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Cleanliness is vital. Give me your cell phones.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if there\u2019s an emergency?\u201d\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t any. Not while you\u2019re here.\u201d\nStupid control freak, Stewart thought, reaching under the mattress to hand over his cell phone. He\u2019d stashed his, hoping Ryan wouldn\u2019t notice. Tina had, predictably, trusted in Ryan, as she trusted in everyone, and left hers in her pocket.\nRyan had been dealing pot out of the back of the Jiffy Lube not long before his rebirth as Greensdale\u2019s local lord of blood. Now, Ryan had abandoned his Nirvana jean jacket for a sleeveless white shirt that highlighted his sanguine marks \u2014 the crusted hole punched into his neck, the plastic valve of his arterial line neatly gauze-bandaged around his left arm. He\u2019d chopped off his mullet and replaced it with an ascetic\u2019s buzzcut to highlight his new-found spirituality. Stewart wondered how long that would last.\n\u201cI\u2019ll give it back when you\u2019re done.\u201d Ryan placed the phone into a locked metal box. \u201cAnd I apologize for the vulgarity, my friends, but there is the issue of compensation.\u201d\n\u201cTake it. It\u2019s all there.\u201d Stewart gestured toward his pants heaped in the corner. And it was all there; his summer job\u2019s savings. His first semester in college would now be ramen noodles and Wonder Bread.\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cI want you to hand it to me. As a token of willingness on your spiritual journey.\u201d\nStewart swallowed a groan as he fished his wallet out but his irritation vanished once he saw Tina\u2019s smile. She focused all her affection on him; even in this filthy, abandoned mansion, it was still a thrill to see her naked.\nRyan counted it out, then shoved the bills into his pocket. \u201cI take cost only,\u201d he said. \u201cMy goal is to knit the world together. If I could hook the President into the Chinese head of state, we\u2019d have world peace within a week. Would that I could give this to you both as a gift \u2014 but alas, hooking up\u2019s spendy these days now that they\u2019ve restricted sales of medical equipment. Do you know what lancets are going for on eBay now?\n\u201cNo matter. Lie down like the others: bellies touching, arm out where I can put in the shunt.\u201d\nAs he pressed his skin against hers, Stewart was embarrassed to find his erect penis pressing against Tina\u2019s belly. Even here, he still wanted her. He was so terrified of the day she\u2019d leave him that his whole body ached to get inside her every chance he got.\nYet while he felt humiliated, getting a boner in front of Ryan, Tina got off on it, riding the excitement of the coming trip. She ground her hips against him.\nA calloused hand pulled her away. \u201cNone of that,\u201d Ryan barked, tugging a seatbelt strap over Stewart\u2019s arm, pulling him tight to the mattress.\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?!\u201d Stewart cried, struggling \u2014 but Ryan trapped his legs swiftly, fastening buckles to clasps drilled in the floor.\n\u201cYou might hurt yourself if you move, chum.\u201d He bound Tina to the mattress. \u201cThese are arteries we\u2019re dealing with; you freak out, start yanking tubes, you might bleed to death. You can breed after you\u2019ve learned how to star-surf. But the first time in? Everyone\u2019s strapped.\u201d\nYou\u2019re just jealous because we\u2019re doing it together, Stewart thought, wriggling, but he was held fast. Tina had just enough play in her bonds to take his free hand in hers. Stewart strained at the bonds for real, ready to tell Ryan exactly what he thought, but Tina shushed him.\n\u201cThis is for us,\u201d Tina reassured him. \u201cFor us. Let it happen, Stewart.\u201d And she craned her neck as far as the restraints would allow to kiss him. Ryan hauled dripping tubing and needles out of a bucket full of bleach, then ripped open a blood-bag with his teeth.\n\u201cWait,\u201d Stewart said, feeling the panic start to take. \u201dShouldn\u2019t you see if we\u2019re compatible blood types?\u201d\n\u201cThat stuff\u2019s overhyped. A little Benadryl gets A into B, no problems.\u201d He shoved a pink pill into their mouths. Then he flicked the moisture off a tube, wrapped his lips around one end, dropped the other end into the blood-bag, which leaked all over the floor. He sucked bright plasma up to the top, putting his thumb over the tip to keep it from slipping back down, then clamped it at both ends. Blood dribbled from his mouth.\n\u201cAlso, as long as we\u2019re debunking Hollywood legends,\u201d he said, \u201cYou need a lot of air in your system to kill you. A couple of cc\u2019s bubbling inside you? No sweat. What they don\u2019t tell you, however, is the first arterial stick hurts like a bitch. The walls of the arteries are wrapped in muscle. You gotta go deep to hit an artery.\u201d\nHe wiped a bleach-covered rag across Stewart\u2019s arm, then took out a huge needle and a spool of thin wire. Ryan knelt down to look Stewart in the eye.\n\u201cA lot of guys cry when I stick it in,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no shame in it.\u201d\n\u201cJust do it,\u201d Stewart said, gritting his teeth. And after the pain subsided, he noted the blood that had squirted from his arm had joined a hundred other dried blood-sprays on the ceiling. He pointed this out to Tina as she screamed, too.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe three wounds pulsed like new organs, obscenely sensitive. He could feel the thin twinge as the wire coathangers swayed above them, the almost imperceptible movement like a yank at the back of his hair. He felt the heat of hives swelling around the needle tips as his body fought the contaminants. Every millimeter of irritated flesh around the needles made the needle\u2019s foreignness apparent to Stewart, marking a precise outline of what had been done to him.\nAnd he felt the strange coldness of his girlfriend\u2019s blood flowing into him; each push down the tube swelled his neck, flooded his veins full of her.\nWhy had he ever thought they were compatible?\nTina kept her eyes closed, squeezing his hand tight; each squeeze traveled up his arm to jitter the needles. Her quickened heartbeat felt like fingers drumming on his skin. He held his breath, trying to slow his heart, but with every heartbeat she let out a choked moan, helpless to fend him off.\nHe wanted to reassure her everything would be all right, but their veins carried the truth: they were unsuitable, out of sync. They always had been, ever since he\u2019d been just another shy AV kid setting up lights for the Greensdale High production of Bye Bye Birdie.\nAnd now they were going to pay the price. This would be the ultimate breakup, a slow death by torture.\nWhy had she pulled him down from the rafters? She was the star, beautiful and popular, the most artistic girl in the whole school. He wanted to ask her what about him had caught her eye, especially when all the jocks kept asking her out, but she always laughed it off. \u201cYou\u2019re such a dear,\u201d she said.\nShe didn\u2019t understand: without a reason for her staying, he\u2019d always wonder when she might leave.\nSo he never complained when she treated him like a fix-up project, whisking him off to foreign films and poetry slams and shadowy alcoves in cemeteries because she saw something in him that needed to be filled up with experience.\nHe\u2019d liked that. He\u2019d liked being hers. Until now.\nNow all their differences were made physical: his heartbeat was like him, slow and stolid, resistant to change. And hers was flighty and erratic, unable to settle into a healthy rhythm. Their bodies were battling each other. He could taste her terror on his tongue.\nThat atonal music blared in his ear, unpredictable squawks and silences.\nThe only thing that kept Stewart from yanking his shunts out was, as Ryan had predicted, the straps. They bound him tight. He would have howled for freedom, but it would have pissed off Tina, and he knew Ryan would not let them out anyway.\nIt would be like this until Sunday evening. Thirty hours from now. He\u2019d even lied to his Mom and Dad, told them he\u2019d headed up to Sacamore for the weekend to attend a Broadway play. There would be no rescues, just he and Tina slowly destroying each other.\nThirty hours. Thirty hours to die at a madman\u2019s hands.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cThis music you hear is Tachycardia.\u201d He spoke in hushed tones, as though he was giving them a beautiful gift. \u201cMusicians attempting to emulate Atlas\u2019s voice.\u201d\nStewart wished they\u2019d turn it off. It didn\u2019t sound like music, but some inorganic machine struggling vainly towards life.\nRyan waved up at the speakers. \u201cThat is the finest sound system I could afford \u2014 the beauty of Tachycardia\u2019s orchestrations is that mere humans cannot hear eighty percent of it. These speakers broadcast ultrasonic sounds and subsonic bass that we register only on a cellular level. But the speakers sound them nonetheless.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Stewart croaked. The needle scraped against his larynx.\nRyan chuckled, shaking his head. Tina also chuckled, the first vocalization she\u2019d made since they had been strapped in, and Stewart felt a jealous pang. Even now, Ryan was breaking their bond, sliding in between them at the moment of death. He wondered whether Tina could feel his hatred pounding inside her brain.\n\u201cTo remind us of how very small we are, of course.\u201d He had a father\u2019s indulgence of Stewart\u2019s ignorance, which rankled him, but then Ryan added: \u201cYou\u2019ll understand once you feel Him in your veins.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s Him?\u201d Stewart\u2019s throat gummed up the words.\n\u201cAtlas, naturally. Did you forget?\u201d\nStewart had forgotten. Then again, he\u2019d only come to stop Tina from consanguinating with Ryan. All her talk of hooking into some mythical beast was just Tina being mystical again \u2014 the way she warded away ghosts by refusing to speak Macbeth\u2019s name in the theater or smudged burnt sage on her wrists for strength before a performance.\nThis far in, though, he wondered who was crazy.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d said Ryan, hugging him tightly. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cLook at me,\u201d she insisted. \u201cLook at me.\u201d\nStewart had no other choice; Ryan had, naturally, placed him to face the window, putting his back to the other consanguinated and leaving him isolated. Tina could, if she wanted, lift up her head to look over Stewart\u2019s face and see what everyone else was doing. He couldn\u2019t. Moving his neck would just drive the needle in deeper.\nShe reached over with her free hand and interlaced her fingers with his.\n\u201cTogether,\u201d she said. Her eyes had never seemed so beautiful.\nHe lost himself in her, and as he matched her breathing, their heartbeats began to circle each other like boxers \u2014 not together, not yet, but at least aware of each other.\nRyan wondered what it was like for the pregnant couples, their babies\u2019 heartbeats tossed about like a shell in the surf. It didn\u2019t matter. He and Tina were consanguinated now.\nNow they shared blood, Stewart understood that being bonded meant learning new habits; it was like learning to walk with four legs instead of two. Being together was not enough. They would have to learn how to die as one.\nBecause this was still killing them.\nHis mouth was dry. His body itched like an anthill. He looked at Tina\u2019s face, trying to see if she had black bruises filled with stars, but she had nothing but red welts and he wasn\u2019t sure whether he had seen that anyway.\nHad Ryan drugged them? He could have. Stewart hadn\u2019t seen what went into that bucket. But he\u2019d seen things before that.\nCould it be an aerosol LSD? Such things existed, right?\nTina shivered in goose-pimpling spasms, reacting to something he had pumped into her.\nI\u2019m sorry, he mouthed, his tongue so parched it stuck to the roof of his mouth.\n\u201cDon\u2019t apologize,\u201d she told him. \u201cIt\u2019s you. Your essence.\u201d\nHow could he ever have wanted Ryan to share this with her? This glorious unraveling? The enlightenment of bare survival, left with only one human to live with? There was no romance in this, no more than there was romance in clinging to a board after a shipwreck, but romance was not the same as intimacy. This experience was them, and only them.\nHe didn\u2019t wonder why she\u2019d chosen him, now. Those thoughts were useless, luxuries of a better time.\nHis world had narrowed to Tina. Her world had narrowed to him. If they died before Sunday, at least they had that.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cEveryone hates the bedbugs at first,\u201d Ryan said. \u201dBut you\u2019ll love them, once you\u2019ve ridden Atlas.\u201d\nStewart found that hard to believe. They scuttled underneath his ribs. He couldn\u2019t feel them feasting, but he felt the sores breaking open as they dropped off.\nRyan brushed his hand across Stewart\u2019s back. Stewart heard the soft patter of carapaces falling to the floor.\n\u201cWe keep them for two reasons,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cFirst off, they go through what you\u2019re going through. Do you know how they breed?\u201d\n\u201cNuh.\u201d Stewart s tongue felt like cardboard.\n\u201cThe females have no vaginas. The males stab the females with hypodermic genitalia, ejaculating into their body cavity.\u201d He pushed his index finger through the closed fingers of his fist, miming the action. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? They, too, achieve life through their wounds.\u201d\nRyan was hushed with wonder. Tina cooed in appreciation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beauty that exists nowhere else. But that\u2019s not why we tolerate them.\u201d\n\u201cWhuh then?\u201d Stewart asked.\n\u201cBecause they\u2019re life, of course,\u201d said Ryan.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHe swallowed back envy. His girlfriend wanted Ryan; hell, he wanted Ryan. He didn\u2019t want to need the bastard, but the Gatorade\u2019s smell was life itself. How long had it been since he\u2019d had water? Two days? Three?\nHe was dependent on this Jiffy Lube madman for survival. He suppressed a surge of obscene gratitude, furious.\nStewart could hear nothing but the sloshing as Ryan walked the plastic cooler around to each couple, then moist slurping sounds as Ryan fed them. There were whispers, back slaps, attaboys.\nThen Ryan stood behind him. For a moment, Stewart thought Ryan would stand there just long enough to give him hope, then drag the Gatorade away.\nInstead, Ryan knelt down to give him a shoulder massage.\nStewart cringed, terrified Ryan would jitter the needle in his neck, but Ryan\u2019s hands were trained; he knew just where to touch. Stewart felt like a plant being tended in some exquisite garden.\n\u201cAh, Stewart,\u201d Ryan whispered. \u201dWho knew I\u2019d still find you here?\u201d\nStewart wondered where else he could have gone. Ryan unspooled a tube, placed it between Stewart\u2019s lips. Stewart sucked hard. A trickle of sweet fluid coated his throat.\nIt was the most delicious moisture ever.\n\u201cI was certain you\u2019d back out,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI told Tina, he\u2019s just another unenlightened bag of flesh; he\u2019ll leave, or start screaming in the bonds the second I get him in. He\u2019ll tell the newspapers how horrible we all are, all without ever riding Atlas. But she told me, no, he\u2019s got depth, he just needs a chance. And you\u2019ve stayed, my friend. You proved me wrong. And soon, you will ride.\u201d\nHe plucked the tube out.\n\u201cNot too much.\u201d Ryan pressed Stewart\u2019s head down. \u201dDon\u2019t want you to throw up. Just enough to keep you alive long enough to entice Him. He\u2019ll come.\u201d\nHe moved the tube over to Tina, who still muttered the same word repeatedly. And as Ryan fed her, Stewart realized what she was saying:\nAtlas. Atlas. Atlas.\n\u201cShe wants wisdom so badly,\u201d Ryan murmured, ruffling her hair. \u201cAnd as she rides Atlas, she\u2019ll drag you beyond the edge of the universe. You\u2019re a lucky man, Stewart, to have a woman who sees so much.\u201d\nIn a past time, that might have made Stewart feel insignificant. But here, with their bodies so interlocked for this journey, it felt like the purest truth Stewart had ever heard.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nTheir heartbeats had, finally, synced up \u2014 but they did not beat together. Tina\u2019s heart had developed an erratic, stomping pattern that would have killed her if it had beaten alone. But like a dancing partner, Stewart\u2019s heartbeat had adopted a fluttering counter-beat, a syncopated cadence that pushed when Tina pulled.\nIt was a music they created with their own bodies, so elaborate it took hours to fathom, a progression uniquely suited to carry blood through two people. A perfect art.\nStewart kept forgetting the straps were there. He tried to pull her chest against his, to bring her heart closer to his, and was continually surprised to feel restraint. He supposed this was delirium, but he didn\u2019t care; they were together, strapped in for survival.\nHis body wept with sores; his eyelids stuck together. But he didn\u2019t need to see Tina; he felt her, and her presence within him made his own presence starkly apparent.\nExcept.\nExcept there was something else within them.\nHe wouldn\u2019t have been aware of it, hours ago. But now that he felt his own body so clearly, felt the fragile ecosystem of himself breaking down, he felt the faintest tip of something invading them from the inside. They had conjoined their own circulatory systems to become one entity, working in unison \u2014 and now they had stabilized, reaching a form of critical mass, something else reached out to intertwine with them.\nHe opened his eyes, stickily; lightless pools blossomed across Tina\u2019s cheeks.\n\u201cAtlas,\u201d Tina said, rapturous, then coughed herself insensate.\nThe Gatorade, Stewart thought, he drugged the Gatorade. But he didn\u2019t believe that. This feeling was anchored in flesh.\nHer heartbeat shifted, making room for the third. So did Stewart\u2019s. It grew inside them, a shadow on an X-ray. And when Atlas\u2019 first pulse thrummed through them hours later it was like giving birth, a huge beast squeezing through them, shoving their organs against their ribs.\nTina flung back her head and screamed, as did Stewart, and he realized everyone else in the room was howling as Atlas\u2019 pulse swept them away from their bodies, out of the room, into the depths of space.\nHe couldn\u2019t time it, Stewart thought, Ryan couldn\u2019t time us all together \u2014\nHe was torn from his eyes.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThis was the space between stars.\nHe flexed his hands and felt nothing; there was not a breath of air, not a mote of dust, not a droplet of fluid. He hurtled through emptiness, on the way to more emptiness. Distant smudges of diffuse illumination \u2014 galaxies? \u2014 whirled around him.\nThat was fine. This was just a bad trip, was all. Stewart had read about those. It was awful, this surety that he\u2019d be here for decades, flying from nothing to nothing. But eventually he\u2019d wake up next to Tina.\nStewart counted to a hundred.\nHe counted to a thousand.\nThen he counted to sixty thousand, four hundred, and fifty-three before he felt the seams of his sanity starting to stretch.\nYou couldn\u2019t count to sixty thousand and not wake up, couldn\u2019t you? Had Sunday night passed? Must have. Maybe the whole week had passed.\nMaybe he was dead.\nHe tried to scream, tried to wake up wake up wake up, but his muscles were stiff as frozen hamburger. His eyes, flecked with snowflakes, remained fixed upon the murky star-blurs that whirled around him.\nWas this what happened to all good little boys who strapped themselves in for Atlas? Did they all die? Or did they go insane, drawing inside their heads like a turtle inside its shell?\nHe tried to listen to his heartbeat, to feel the sync with Tina \u2014 but time had died within him, and his chest had been hollowed to hold its corpse. His body was as silent as a gravestone.\nWhat a gift my whole world was, he thought. So much earth and wind and water. A wealth of existence, and he\u2019d squandered it all. Now he was caught between whirling light and dead blackness and though he kept counting, the numbers never ran out.\nA truth crept inside him: there was no Tina, not really. Compared to this nothingness, Tina was a discarded fraction, a rounding error \u2014 just like those smudges. Each star in that distant galaxy was a grain of sand floating in a sea, and he was a smaller grain drifting in that water hoping to touch the sand, but it was better to think the sand was an illusion, matter was an illusion, life was an illusion.\nThe truth was the void. Everything shrank to nothing before that.\nHe counted more, and by the time he reached a hundred thousand he forgot Tina\u2019s kisses. Five hundred thousand repetitions scooped out his memories of sunlight. A million vacuumed away his name. Ten million, and just before Stewart\u2019s mind popped like an air-stuffed vein, he noticed the shine behind the stars.\nIt was no more than a faint shimmer. But his cracked lips mouthed the name: Atlas.\nIt was not aware of him, no more than Stewart would have been aware of a single blood cell. Yet it was alive, and he was engulfed within it.\nThank you thank you thank you, Stewart thought, feeling something near him after endless revolutions, flooding him with remembrance \u2014 and as he beamed waves of worship at Atlas he zoomed closer, except that couldn\u2019t be happening but oh God he was melting into the light, hooking into its lustrous consciousness\nAnd he was Atlas.\nIts body\u2019s hazy caverns were continually torn apart by the gravitational well of stars that passed through it, scattershot with a trillion self-repairing wounds. It rode the stars out of some long-ebbing inertia, absorbing the dead nebulae and burst stars and shattered planets into its body, more of a pulsating gas than a creature.\nIt had no conscious thought, no intellect \u2014 but Stewart was seized with triumph nonetheless. It was enough for life to exist, spread so far against such a darkness.\nHe settled into its body\u2019s aeon-slow pulse. Its organs retreated from each other with the inevitability of tectonic plates, forming puckered, encircling ridges. Atlas was swelling, engulfing \u2014\n\u2014 dividing.\nIt\u2019s winning, Stewart thought in a paroxysm of joy, seeing the beauty of reproduction, the fierce fight to fill the universe with consciousness. It would scavenge enough mass to split apart, and then there would be two beasts to fight the darkness.\nHe slid down the glimmering trails of Atlas\u2019 sensory organs, sifting through blank seas to find his way back to Tina. He saw the planets \u2014 specks of rock, fearfully clustered together for warmth around a guttering match. Everything Stewart knew was a thin film on a dust mote. The galaxy did not hold life; it held emptiness, loneliness, so much that if he had been able to see it all it would have filled his brain like cold sea water rolling into a drowning man\u2019s lungs.\nBut here, bobbing fitfully in a sea of coincidental forces, was a sliver of life. It wasn\u2019t Tina who was amazing \u2014 it was the fact that she could create more Tinas, that we could expand and devour like Atlas, a single atom doubling within the void, and doubling, and doubling, and doubling\u2026\nHe carried the truth of existence inside him, a glacial coldness. But that terrible absence made this world so magnificent. Tears streamed from his eyes as Ryan hugged him tight, called him brother.\nStewart pressed his face against Ryan\u2019s shoulder and smelled his million scents; the universe was nothing but gaps, but here was another human being, so precious. So close.\nHe never wanted to be separated from anyone again.\nTina, shivering, crawled over to join him.\n\u201cDid you see?\u201d she asked, beaming with delight. \u201cDid you see what we need to do?\u201d\nHe nodded, so grateful for the gift she\u2019d given him. She kissed him, and the fetid breath on her lips was the growth of organic matter, everything between and inside them a miracle made new. Soon they would make love, all of them, determined to be like Atlas.\nOne by one, the other consanguinated made their way to their new brethren in the corner and hugged them, exulting in the feel of soft skin underneath their hands, ready to copulate and breed and fill that void. This was all the understanding that existed.\nThis flesh. This blood.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue22\/3lbe22_story3.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":">They were naked, now, on a dirty mattress.

While waiting for the others, I had time to think about the unlikelihood of our success. If only we could understand more fully what moves us, we might spare ourselves and others some suffering. Yet then again, wisdom might only ever be in endurance. Someday there will be a being of greater or more consistent wisdom, one with an open design. Humans are closed and rigid, and though the light pours in, we are grown to allow only so much of it inside. We have knowledge, but in the future, there will be a creature more open than us, as open as the Earth, and they will truly understand.\nThe year was turning downward and would soon reach the bottom and turn up again, with or without us. A forest, now there was a being with an open mind. We carry one inside our heads, always rerooting itself, but physically closed to others, and I think that\u2019s the difference. Bodies must touch for understanding. Under the limbs, I started a fire and unpacked my knapsack. Three hours left, and I cooked potato cakes on the coals. It seemed so inane, so ordinary, that I could hardly eat. But what else was there to do? My appetite dwindled, and I waited, a half-eaten cake on my tin plate.\nThe other two arrived together. I knew where they came from, but little more about them. Antonov, from the Cabinet, and Limpak, a photographer and accomplished spelunker from somewhere out east. Antonov was a handsome man, but bitter around the eyes, bundled up twice his girth against the cold. Limpak, dark and mousey, had the audacity to arrive with tiny brass bells dangling from the hem of his jacket. They approached the fire, chuckling.\n\u201cGood evening,\u201d Antonov said. \u201cSome last meal.\u201d\nLimpak snorted, and I tried to smile. At least they were in high spirits.\nThe greeting was cold and awkward. I do not shake hands. I embrace friends and even casual acquaintances, but shaking hands feels somehow fraudulent, and Antonov struck me as the sort who might use the grasp as a test of willpower or confidence. We shared a greeting and exchanged names, and \u201cquickly now,\u201d we compared information on the bells. Antonov had a map dug up from a friend of an associate who once worked in one of the facilities like the one we sought. He was said they all shared a similar blueprint. Limpak had climbing gear, what looked like a mess of cord, buckles, and hooks. None of us knew where to begin.\nI poured dirt on the fire and offered them the remaining potato cakes. Antonov refused, but Limpak put one in his mouth all at once. He stood with his mouth full, staring at us as if we were merely camping and the only decision to make was where to pitch our tent.\n\u201cThe clock is ticking,\u201d Antonov said. He produced with a flourish his Cabinet-issued pocket watch, pretentiously ornate. \u201cLess than three hours now.\u201d\nI looked at Limpak, he swallowed and shook his head, and I looked back to Antonov. \u201cWe have to go down,\u201d I said. \u201cThrough the water. They told me we could enter through any of the swamps around here, but I\u2019m not sure he wasn\u2019t guessing.\u201d\nLimpak walked a few meters ahead of me, and Antonov a few behind. The wetlands sucked at our boots, and one of mine nearly came free. I tightened the laces and buckle. Limpak began to sing a folk song about the reasons we get up in the morning.\nHe finished and said, \u201cAnd for you, Mr. Antonov, where is your heart? Why do you wake?\u201d\n\u201cRevenge,\u201d he said, seriously at first, then he laughed. and Antonov joined him.\nLimpak stopped and waited for me to catch up. He looked at me with his lopsided smile. \u201cAnd you?\u201d\n\u201cI want to see what happens next.\u201d\nLimpak nodded, impressed or in agreement. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to find out, isn\u2019t there? No peeking. You just have to wait.\u201d\nWe marched on, looking for the entrance to the depths.\nHe was right. Clairvoyance is not possible. Nothing travels faster than the arrow of time, which crosses the magic length of God\u2019s body, and this is the reason I wake every morning and rise from bed: to see how the arrow flies, and if it might one day strike its target.\nGod is with those who do not have a worldview. Antonov would have followed the unbending logic of his law-abiding cosmos into darkness. He would have blinded us to the entrance, or at least the one we took.\nThe stairway in the swamp was covered only with our preconceptions.\n\u201cIt is here,\u201d I said with certainty. I crouched down and put my fingertips to a cold stone. Tiny black mites crawled around searching for leaf mold or refuge. The bells would shake them to pieces too. \u201cLook.\u201d\nThey looked to where I pointed but could not see the stone nor the steps, nor the opening at first. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d they asked. Antonov was the last to see it, but he didn\u2019t let us know that.\nOnce they saw the first stone step, then the stairway became real.\nWhat if we had walked by it? Is this why we were chosen? Why I was chosen?\n\u201cWe have to go down here?\u201d Limpak said, his little bells ringing as he crouched beside me. \u201cThis looks like the entrance to a witch\u2019s house.\u201d Already he had begun to move his hand to the seven sacred windows of the flesh, not eyes and mouth, but the points aligned with the phases of the Moon. Antonov scoffed, but when Limpak\u2019s fingers touched each window in his flesh, they sang, for him, like struck glass.\nI became glad for his company when he found the post and the rope nearby. The ancient algaed iron post anchored in the swamp, wrapped with the gnarled head of a rope thicker than my neck. The taut rope extended from the post straight down into the earth, disappearing into a depth we could not imagine.\nAntonov tugged at the rope, maybe we could take it with us. But it held fast. Limpak's bolt cutters couldn't fit around the bulk of it.\n\u201cSo much for shortcuts,\u201d Limpak said.\nWe started down the stairs and turned on our headlamps. Swamp water trickled down the steps and dripped onto our heads from the heavily eroded ceiling. Antonov counted the steps. \u201cSixty. Sixty-one. Sixty-two.\u201d The stairway turned to the right once, and then again to the left. Bugs colonized my scalp. Limpak wrung out water from his little brown cap. A half-meter-long centipede slipped over my boot, and I could smell it in the musty air, I could hear the movement of its legs. Later, at the bottom of the stairs (\u201cTwo-hundred-six\u201d) we saw many more. Antonov caught one and bagged it, chasing its life with a pill of toxic gas. The centipede bit through the bag and escaped.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I said at the bottom. I was constantly urging them onward, for they either grew weaker or more apprehensive the closer we came to our destination. \u201cFaster,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t slip. Come on.\u201d\nThe corridor ahead was all stone and black wires crossing the path at all heights. Limpak\u2019s foot tangled in them as soon as he took a step, and Antonov cut him free.\n\u201cShould we begin cutting the cords now?\u201d he asked, the points of his cutters black and gleaming moist in our headlamps. \u201cThese might hold the bells some way along the line. They might be part of it.\u201d He began snipping the wires, almost delicately, as if he were pruning an ivy.\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be rich,\u201d Limpak said, \u201cif this was all that needed to be done? A little trim. And we could return to the surface and not gone any further after all.\u201d He chuckled and brought his camera level with my face. The flash went off. I forgot to blink, and mercury suns hung above the wires. \u201cWe could return home and be happy. As happy as we were before anyway.\u201d He laughed again, and Antonov squeezed his shoulder as he caught up to us.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I said.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDown here below the swamp, we were closer to the primordial silence than I have ever been. The drippings of the swamp ceased. We could no longer hear birdsong or the sky tearing of planes. Even our footsteps fell hushed, muffled by a carpet of mushrooms. The spores glowed green gold in the light of our headlamps, and we tried not to cough. We breathed slowly and without sound, so as not to wake the silence into creation.\nBut Limpak tripped and his camera tumbled from his hands. It crashed into the wall of the corridor and broke in two, each piece breaking the calm with its own clamor. Limpak cursed, rushed ahead, and then he was gone.\nWe found neither the camera nor Limpak nor his little brown cap, only two holes in the floor about an arm\u2019s length apart, their edges perfectly carved. Our light didn\u2019t reach to the bottom of either. Antonov bent over and called into the pit, and I almost told him to shut up. Echoes answered him, and then a long whine that may have belonged to an animal as easily as some engine or generator. When it faded, we were left with the fact of Limpak\u2019s sudden uncreation.\n\u201cWhat a coincidence,\u201d Antonov said.\nI sighed and began touching the seven sacred windows, as many as I could remember, in memory of Limpak. I got to five before Antonov tossed something into the hole on the right. He then rummaged in his backpack.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like me because I\u2019m a Cabinet man,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t dislike you. Not because of a little difference in theory.\u201d\nThe Cabinet of Nihilists, weaving meaning from meaninglessness, proving yet ignoring their own self-constructed absurdity. He was right, and though they did good work sometimes, they went too far. They fetishized abstraction. They cut life into pieces until they could no longer see the whole. They abused semantics. In short, they were always missing the point.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I nodded at the machine in his hands.\n\u201cNothing.\u201d He put it away in his backpack and sniffed. \u201cI think Limpak found us a shortcut.\u201d\n\u201cHe could still be alive,\u201d I said. \u201cWater at the bottom. Anything.\u201d\nAntonov nodded once, very slowly.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cOne hour, two minutes,\u201d Antonov announced.\nWe walked on bare stone now, or perhaps a floor that had once been tiled, since worn over centuries. I could still see a few bits of mortar, now chalk dry and scattered. Ahead I saw water.\n\u201cDid they tell you why they gave us so little time?\u201d Antonov asked.\n\u201cThey gave us all the time they could.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good enough for you? I\u2019m\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWatch your step. Those are deep puddles.\u201d\n\u201cNo they\u2019re not.\u201d And then he was up to his waist in water, cursing. \u201cMakes no sense. The floor. Water can\u2019t pool here.\u201d He began muttering, calculating.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to get wet anyway,\u201d I said, pointing ahead, where water covered the width of the corridor. The surface twinkled in the light of my headlamp, and something floated there, a kind of fungus or lily, and then more ahead, dozens of them. We climbed into the water, slightly warm and clouded. It reached my chest in most places; Antonov was in up to his neck.\n\u201cWhy do you think they chose us?\u201d he said. \u201cOut of everyone? Did they tell you that much?\u201d\nI felt a softness with my boot and stepped around it. \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be a brilliant scientist?\u201d\n\u201cWell. Okay. But you? Limpak?\u201d\nI sneezed. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Limpak was a professional photographer. He shot the Weregild Wars. The image of the girl dwarfed next to the throne of conches, staring up? On the beach? That was him. His people probably paid for him to be here.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. They can work a deal.\u201d Antonov slipped and dunked under for a moment, the available light suddenly halved. He sputtered and coughed. \u201cAnd you. You\u2019re the campanologist. The last one, they say.\u201d\n\u201cNot the last,\u201d I said. I hate exaggerations. \u201cThey never needed me before. They gave my trade to machines, and I don\u2019t begrudge them, only their masters. It\u2019s been a long time since I founded a bell. Or tuned one.\u201d\nOr rang one at all. When I was a boy, every bell was made of fire. No ceiling, no steeple or belfry could contain the ringing. I felt myself fly off with the sound and vibrate across the sky, beyond it even, into the stars. Watching my father and mother work. Watching the first bell being born. I wanted to be melted down myself and poured into a mold so that I might ring one day. I got as close to them as I could until they were no longer of any use. My parents were working at a dead art. Silence returned to the workshop.\n\u201cAnyone could have gotten this far,\u201d I said. \u201cAnyone can stumble around in the dark and slice a rope when they see one. Dismantle a bell housing.\u201d\nI don\u2019t know what Antonov would have said had we not then entered a large chamber where the water level dropped to my navel. I had the feeling he didn\u2019t believe me, that he didn\u2019t believe just anyone could have made it this far. Or maybe I didn\u2019t believe it. Six unlit chandeliers in Old Pangaian style hung from the ceiling, and shaggy streamers of moss hung from their scrolls and arms, and a small fire-eyed marsupial hung from the moss, its body no bigger than my fist.\nStanding there, I felt nostalgia where before I had felt only a bone-deep urgency. Nostalgia is not a sensation to hurry through. It\u2019s a place to linger.\n\u201cTwo doors,\u201d Antonov said. \u201cThe water is leaking out. Maybe there\u2019s a tide, but it might be automated. Let me look around.\u201d He began untangling some instruments from his backpack. I saw the Cabinet\u2019s insignia on the back of his coat.\n\u201cHurry,\u201d I said, but what I really wanted was to remain there and sink into the nostalgia. It was warm and filling, and strange thoughts began to rise. There is a book in the traditional culture of my people that tells a story about an innocent whale who ended up in the belly of a man, even though he did no wrong. The parable is meant to teach us about perspective: every act of suffering and destruction is simultaneously an instance of nourishment and creation. But since the story is told from the perspective of the whale, most readers gather the wrong lesson: that bad things happen even to good people. Anyone can figure that out. They miss the untold story, but all the holy books of our people are living books and are capable of change.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Antonov said, \u201cHey!\u201d He shook my shoulder, and I felt a shiver down my arm. For once I was glad to have him there. I had gotten lost. We contain multitudes. I am one and many, and there is no urge or sensation I experience that is not me. There\u2019s very little outside that isn\u2019t part of myself as well: all the strange things I have done and seen. We are stardust, yes, but we are starlight too.\n\u201cHere,\u201d Antonov said, pulling me closer to one of the doors. He had a strip of paper in his hand, a readout from one of his devices. \u201cWe\u2019ll go through here.\u201d\nHe had measured humidity or pressure, I didn\u2019t quite catch it, but I trusted his judgement, and we went right, through two additional doors, and into another corridor. Our boots sank into sand. I could smell cinnamon, maybe cloves. Farther on, I felt the floor begin to decline. Gradually at first, and then more noticeably, the passage tipped forward. Soon we were jogging. The sand tumbled before us. It felt as if the entire place were in motion and not just the two of us, as if we were inside a giant hourglass.\n\u201cTime!\u201d I asked, almost out of breath. We were finally going as fast as I liked.\n\u201cForty-five minutes,\u201d Antonov said.\nThe sand slid beneath us and we fell into a cavernous space that yawned beyond the reach of our lights.\nSometime later we landed on dry ground. We stood, surprisingly unharmed. Antonov lit a flare that briefly lit the honeycombed ceiling that housed thousands of bats. Occasionally, one dropped into a quick flight like a black rag blown by the wind and then clung to the distant cave ceiling among its people.\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Antonov said.\nThe damaged heap on the floor was difficult to discern even in the light of our headlamps. Until we found his face. Limpak\u2019s limbs were contorted and bone had torn through his pant leg. Antonov searched him. I heard the crunch as he stepped on a piece of Limpak\u2019s camera.\n\u201cThere\u2019s enough sand here,\u201d I said. \u201cWe could bury him.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no time. Ah.\u201d Antonov held up a piece of cloth or paper in his light. \u201cIt\u2019s not right. There\u2019s water damage?\u201d He seemed distracted.\n\u201cWe could bury him.\u201d\nAntonov approached me, showing me the paper. Limpak had borrowed his map. \u201cIt\u2019s not sad, really,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you think about it.\u201d He pointed to the body. \u201cThere\u2019s barely such a thing as life anyway. Limpak was just a lot of stuff animated because it happened to be arranged a certain way. He only thought he was alive. He only thought he had thoughts and feelings. Let\u2019s not get sentimental now. He\u2019s just stopped working.\u201d\nWe used different words to mean the same thing, and drew different conclusions. We are both lesser and greater than most people believe. We are not the center of all things, but we are large enough to contain it. Being a self at all is miracle enough to me, proof of an exception to all ordinary laws, but I didn\u2019t want to argue. I wanted to continue. \u201cCome on. We don\u2019t have time. You were right about that. Look.\u201d\nTwo wells stood in the center of the room, their blue gray bricks contrasting with the white sand. One nearly overflowed with water while the other was seemingly empty. We studied them a minute. I dipped my hand into the water and wondered how many microscopic creatures were cupped in my palm. Life is held in such delicate yet robust suspension between all layers: between the inside, the outside, between time and the sum of life\u2019s events, between matter and belief. Being is a dance on many floors.\n\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Antonov asked.\n\u201cThat we take a lesson from Limpak and take a shortcut.\u201d The diameter of the empty well was the right size for a person to shimmy down, back to one wall, feet to the other. Antonov considered it for a moment and dropped a stone down the well. We heard a faint impact. He lit a flare and we watched as the little sun tumbled into the darkness and disappeared.\n\u201cI think it must turn part way down,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not a well at all, but part of some kind of delivery system. Maybe there was a ladder at one point. Why don\u2019t we swim down that one?\u201d\nI swore with a little too much passion behind it. I think Antonov was already becoming uncomfortable in my presence. \u201cThere\u2019s no time to deliberate.\u201d\nThe bats flew and talked above our heads as we situated ourselves inside the empty well. Antonov decided to go first. We wore our backpacks on our chests, and I drove a few spikes from Limpak\u2019s equipment into the soles of my boots. We tried to rig up his climbing gear to save us from a fall, but neither of us knew the first thing about it. We didn\u2019t have time to learn.\nThe bricks were damp, but not slick, and the mortar was rough enough to give us tiny footholds all the way down. I was sweating under my coat, but the extra layer protected my back from being sliced open by the uneven surface.\nWe shimmied down. Antonov moved deliberately, and after a few minutes I wanted to kick his feet off the bricks and send him tumbling down, wiping out all the white mushrooms that crossed the well\u2019s interior like cobwebs. Another part of me felt pity for him. I knew he had been chosen for this because he was expendable. He was brilliant, but his pet theories were out of fashion, and even if I disagreed with him I still raged against those who were afraid of dissent. I almost wanted him to make some discovery here that might whiten the faces of the Cabinet.\n\u201cAntonov,\u201d I said.\nHe looked up. \u201cYeah?\u201d Beneath the fatigue and fear, I saw he was handsome, calm, inquisitive. In another permutation of life we might have been friends, or even more than that. But in that claustrophobic well, with death below us\u2014or at least a painful fall\u2014I felt more intimate with him than I imagined ever being in another life.\n\u201cCan you go faster? Just a little?\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d And he did.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cTime?\u201d\n\u201cForty minutes.\u201d\nWe dropped into a wet, warm chamber full of ropes, cords, and pulleys, but none of it looked immediately familiar, and there were no wheels or levers that might have had the power to ring the sorts of bells I expected to find. Antonov brought out his cutters again, and a pulley dropped like an anchor very close to my foot.\n\u201cEnough,\u201d I said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t it.\u201d\nHe was visibly irritated by then. He doubted me. He felt he should be in charge. I led him into a corridor with another ceiling higher than our light could reach. Ropes hung from the darkness.\n\u201cIf they hang from above,\u201d Antonov said, \u201ccould it be we\u2019ve gone below the bells now?\u201d He was checking his map.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how it works. There\u2019s should be a short rope attached to the wheel and the whole\u2014\u201d but he wasn\u2019t listening.\n\u201cA door!\u201d\n\u201cCome on!\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a door right here on the map, and this goes back up. Look at these symbols. We went too far.\u201d\n\u201cNot nearly far enough. What\u2019s the time?\u201d\n\u201cThirty-five minutes.\u201d\n\u201cYour watch is off. It could be any moment now.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not broken. This is the door.\u201d He was examining the wall where the door should have been, trying to find a seam.\n\u201cI\u2019m going this way,\u201d and I went on without him. I was almost relieved. But a few minutes later I heard him jogging to catch up, his backpack rattling. \u201cWe can\u2019t split up,\u201d he said. My heart felt suddenly heavy and soft.\n\u201cHold on!\u201d I held him back.\nOur feet perched on the edge of the ground and open darkness. Hundreds of sturdy bell-ringing ropes hung suspended between an invisible ceiling and an invisible floor. They seemed to stand, straight and taut and perfect, as if enchanted by the music of a flute. I heard the murmured song of water below. Antonov lit and dropped another flare, and we watched it bleed light all the way to the bottom, where it showed us the flowing river in a rose and garnet glow, before it extinguished. The ropes descended into the water.\nI heard a distant chiming.\n\u201cDown,\u201d I said. \u201cNow.\u201d\nI threw my coat and it broke the silence of that gulf like a bat in flight. I pulled on fresh gloves and took to the ropes. I wondered if Antonov had ever climbed before. He was clumsy and slow, and as I watched him I was back in school, a test of my fitness. The teacher held down the free end of the rope with his foot. My grip was weak. I tried over and over, but slipped off. Climb the rope, not my leg, he had said, frustrated with the pudgy weak little boy before him.\nLater, I climbed to the bell chamber of St. Ourania\u2019s and touched my forehead to the Jade Bell of Reconciliation.\n\u201cWho sent you?\u201d Antonov asked from above, a little too loudly, as if he had to repeat himself.\n\u201cWhat do you mean? The same as hired you.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but who? What was their name? What did they look like? Did you recognize them?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201dI said. \u201cThey knew where to find me. I wasn\u2019t hiding. It was no one important. Just a messenger.\u201d\nI thought the truth, that I could not remember, would only slow us down when we were so close to the end. The memory was hazy, like a sunbeam below water. Someone came for me in my little house by the sea. They hadn\u2019t knocked, I remembered that. They must have told me where to be, and when. That was all.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019re almost out of time.\u201d\nThe water at the bottom was ankle deep and warm as bathwater. Antonov dangled somewhere above, cursing. He dropped his backpack, I caught it and set it down gently in the water. Most of the ropes ended here, bound to shackles in the floor, but one went farther down through a hole large enough for me to squeeze through. I became the sensation of standing above the abyss. Our goal was on the other side of the floor, down through the hole. I got to my knees and stared into the water.\nAnd I saw Him, Father of the Bells, the one for whom I had learned the art. The dance of life goes beyond good and evil. In its endless playing, it creates a role and fills it in one ecstatic moment, rewriting the grammar of our bodies. Every cell dances to the music above and the music below and it will continue so long as it is different and so long as there is time and it will end only when every permutation of life has been lived.\nI looked down into the abyss, I looked up into the abyss, and followed with my mind the course of that single rope, from the iron post we had seen aboveground to its terminus somewhere below. I sat down and slid my legs in the water. \u201cAntonov! Hurry!\u201d\nHe was right behind me, panting. He looked haggard and wretched. A leech had attached itself to his neck and lay there like a birthmark. The bells would shake it to pieces.\nI pointed down.\nAntonov began assembling his oxygen tank and breather. \u201cThere\u2019s no time,\u201d I said and knocked it from his hand.\nHe stood slowly and backed away, holding one hand behind his back. \u201cWho sent you? Who?!\u201d\nIt was the first time I had heard him raise his voice. I thought the stress of the journey had finally gotten the best of him. I shook my head. \u201cQuit it, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\u201cNo one sent you,\u201d he said. He had my backpack. I must have left it lying around. He was holding it open. \u201cWhere are your tools? How will you dismantle the housings or take the clappers down?\u201d He thrust his fist into the opening and pulled out a clump of moss. \u201cI know why you\u2019re here.\u201d\nI turned away from him, intent on the mission. Then something struck me in the side of the head, tearing my ear and blinding me for a moment with my own starry interior. I wanted to dive, but he was dragging me and reaching into his own backpack, probably for a weapon. I smelled smoke. I grew faint, almost unconscious, and I saw suddenly the green distance between all the parts of myself, vast and empty yet near, inconsequential, and if you had looked into my body, if you had been able to see into my cells, you might have seen words written on their walls in the language of time, the time of my death, and it was not now.\nWhen I came to, Antonov was slumped forward, his face underwater, gazing into the dark hole. But he released no air bubbles, and the only movement was that of his left hand bobbing on the water\u2019s surface.\nI checked his watch: eleven minutes.\nThen I dove past him into the abyss.\nI no longer needed my headlamp to see. I no longer needed oxygen to breathe. The bubbles were luminous and nourishing. The leviathan my Father danced in the green and gold and blue water, threading among ribbons of weed. I could see the flowers multiplying, as if ready to inherit the earth. His great scales sung against the current.\nAt last the tower came into my view, the campanile, filled with the engine of ringing: the wheels, ropes, and levers. I entered with joy.\nTwelve bells hung in the deep. I rang the full peal.\nI rang all 479,001,600 permutations of the bells, not one repeated; truth is essential, to repeat a sequence would render the ringing false. I was everywhere at once. Flesh confounds cause and effect. The peal rang true out of the depths and across the land, and cats caterwauled, hounds howled, deer bolted into the forest, birds shot into the sky, engines failed, ships groaned, doors opened, cities shook, and the people dropped what they were doing and stood, for once, still and silent.\nThe sound of a bell is the sound of striking emptiness. We ring the bells not against the void, but against the filling of the world, against completeness and the end. We ring the bells to make room for more life. And sometimes I ring them just to hear the sound they make, the clang and clamor that burned into me as a child, the ringing arrow I can ride into the miracle of the sky and down again into day after day.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue30\/3lbe30_story5.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"We had only three hours to reach the bells of the deep before they rang.

Some of the rooms were less musty than the others, but they had cracks at the edges of the windows and got drafty when the cool night air rolled in from the gulf. My father had dropped me off at my grandma\u2019s place out in the sticks and didn\u2019t want to tell me why, but I knew. I was being hidden from my mother and her new boyfriend who was always shouting at me. And she let him shout and boss me around and told me to mind him and goddamn if I was going to do that. Dad was a drunk but he never raised his voice, and Grandma kept him on a close leash when she was around. When I needed to be somewhere where Mom\u2019s people couldn\u2019t find me, Grandma kept me out at her old house where she used to run a shipping firm. Dad drove off and was gone for two days this time. He came back stinking and slept it off on Grandma\u2019s front living room couch, under the bay window. When he woke up, he grabbed my stuff and threw it in the trunk of the old pickup.\nGrandma came out in slippers and a robe.\n\u2014It\u2019s over?\n\u2014Yes, ma\u2019am.\n\u2014Good. Never liked that woman anyhow. You taking Wind home today?\n\u2014I\u2019m off another four. I thought we might go to the bay.\n\u2014Watch for salt gators. They eat dogs. She ain\u2019t much bigger. You got a rifle in the truck?\n\u2014Yes, ma\u2019am.\n\u2014Well, don\u2019t hit the girl if you shoot a gator. Get close, right on top of the head, and aim down. She even awake?\nI was watching from the upstairs window. I could hear everything.\n\u2014She ain\u2019t down yet, but she was awake when I went up. Got time for breakfast, I reckon.\n\u2014I reckon you got money to drink, you can buy your own damn breakfast. You need to be sober with her. You around the girl, no drinking.\n\u2014I know, Mom. Jesus.\n\u2014It\u2019s never over. Never. They come swooping in and smell it on you\u2026\n\u2014Ma, shit. You need to sober up, too.\n\u2014Don\u2019t you tell me shit, boy. Doctor don\u2019t let me do nothing fun no more and you know it. You show up here all day drunk and still stink of booze. Now you want to feed Wind to the salt gators?\nIt\u2019s not true. I knew my grandmother had been drinking. She had been sipping real slow all night, so it wouldn\u2019t set off the medication alarm on her wrist and she wouldn\u2019t need to take the liver shot. She had shown me how to give her that shot, just in case she was out of it. I had to pull up her shirt, and look at her belly button, and hold my hand out to get as far from the belly button as my fingers, while still finding soft tissue. Then, I\u2019d stab her with the needle and push the button, and the emergency pen would do the rest. I had been walking around the house, counting the pens in the rooms. I had watched her drinking, and I had been thinking about what I was going to have to do next. I was going to have to be ready, or I\u2019d be all alone out in the oaks and huisache scrub, and I didn\u2019t know how to use the oven, yet. I didn\u2019t know how to make anything but chips and salsa and cereal. No telling when Dad came back. I was lying awake, listening for his truck, hoping he\u2019d be back tonight so he could give her the shot if she drank too much. He didn\u2019t know that, though, but I bet he kind of knew. He had to kind of suspect, a little. He knew his mother.\n\u2014Shoot, Mama. I got days and days off leftover because the bitch didn\u2019t even show. She didn\u2019t even show up to fight for our babygirl in court. Saved us days of bills. I got more time, now. And I drank a bit last night trying to figure it all out. I did. I\u2019m done with it now. Wind was safe with you. Shoot, woman. Driving me up the damn elevator.\n\u2014Well, you keep your head clear with her. She needs you to be the dad you tell the courts that you are.\n\u2014Leastways, I showed up. Anyway, like you was sober when I was a sprout.\nShe threw her slippers at him, one at a time. He let them come. He didn\u2019t bother ducking. He just ignored her and stomped into the house for the kitchen. He got out some leftover potatoes and soy sausages. He threw them in the microwave in two bowls, one for each of us.\nI was in the kitchen, then. He saw me, and he smiled to light up the whole world at me. His teeth were yellow like the sun, and his skin was so dark, like the night sky.\n\u2014Good morning, sprout. You ready to go to the ocean?\n\u2014Where have you been, Dad? Grandma says you\u2019re in trouble.\n\u2014I was with your mom for a bit, and her new fella. We were talking about what we are going to do with you. You\u2019re staying with me and Grandma, now. For good. You like that?\n\u2014Where is Mom staying?\n\u2014With her new man. They\u2019re going to be living on the moon. That one city up there, up in the sky. We talked about that. I was off at the courthouse so the judge could decide whether you stayed here with me, or went up with her. Go out at night and look up and wave to her. She\u2019ll be looking down, I know. They got jobs up there, and everything, pay better than mine. She\u2019ll be sending us some money, too, for food and clothes and stuff. I reckon we can call them on a pad when the Moon\u2019s close enough. Let you talk to your mom, then, if you wanna.\n\u2014She coming back for Thanksgiving?\n\u2014You can ask her. Don\u2019t be disappointed if she can\u2019t. She wanted to take you up there, you know. She isn\u2019t abandoning you. We had a big fight about it. The court decided it was best you stay here with Grandma and me. She fought hard to keep you. We both did. The court decided for me. I\u2019m grateful for that. You know, we all love you very much, Wind. We all do. You are loved by everyone on this earth and the Moon, too.\nGrandma came in with her dirty slippers in her hand like she was going to throw them again. She sat down at the table, and waited for her son to lay something down for her. He put one bowl out for her and one for me. He got some mint tea out for himself. It settles his stomach when he is coming down from drinking. He might put some CBD oil in it, too, if he\u2019s really off. He might have had that before he came to get me out of bed, before Grandma could see. She hated all of it. She hated how he chose to live. I could tell, even then, that he was bad. He said bad words when he thought I couldn\u2019t hear them. He did whatever he wanted when no one was looking. He didn\u2019t do the things a dad was supposed to do, like read me stories or sing me songs or anything like that. He was better than Mom, though. She just yelled all the time.\nWas Mom bad, too? Probably. One time, she grabbed me so hard it bruised my arm. She threw things at my dad when they were still together. They were bad together, everyone knew. They were both bad. So I thought I was probably bad, too. Grandma didn\u2019t let me, though. She said I was going to do better. Every generation has to do better than the last. Time passes, and you can improve yourself. Then, when I have kids, they won\u2019t even know that sometimes I was bad when I was a kid. They\u2019ll think I was always good, and I won\u2019t tell them any better.\nGrandma and I ate real quiet. We didn\u2019t speak, just eat. I listened close, in the silence, and I could hear us chewing through the old potatoes. I could hear every slurp of my father\u2019s tea. When we finished I cleared the plates and Dad nodded at his mom, and she grunted at him.\n\u2014Have fun.\n\u2014You, too.\nI got in the driver\u2019s side door, sat in the driver's seat and took the steering wheel. Dad came out and snorted at me.\n\u2014You driving us, then?\n\u2014I can drive.\n\u2014You know where we\u2019re going?\n\u2014No. I can drive, though. You just tell me where to go.\n\u2014Scoot.\nI waited; my hands pressed into the steering wheel. I wanted to drive. I knew it was wrong, but Grandma had already taught me a little, with one of her old trucks. It passed the time. She said if I was out there with her, alone, I needed to be able to drive a stick and shoot a gun in case something happened. An emergency. She never showed me the gun. She just showed me the needles, and where she kept them in every room. She told me if she had to use one, and not to use that one again until she could get a replacement from the mail robots.\n\u2014Scoot, little sprout. Scoot scoot.\nI huffed and puffed and obeyed my father. I climbed over to the passenger side and buckled in, there. The truck was older than him. It could have been. The passenger seat was more duct tape than pleather, and the AC was busted. My window was stuck open halfway. The driver side rolled up and down. We had to park where the rain couldn\u2019t get in. He drove us straight out and stopped at a charging station for new power cells and breakfast burritos. He got me one, too, but I already ate, so I put it in my pocket when he wasn\u2019t looking. I knew he\u2019d be mad if I didn\u2019t eat it. When he got mad, he didn\u2019t shout. He just got real grumpy and quiet. He would tell me to be still and do nothing. I hid the it for later, in case he got mad and forgot to get food for us.\nBack on the road, he asked if staying with him and Grandma was what I wanted.\n\u2014I like Grandma\u2019s place, Dad. It\u2019s way out there. It\u2019s fun. The old truck scrapyard is cool.\n\u2014You ain\u2019t supposed to be playing in those old heaps. She won\u2019t be out there long. Not at her age. She\u2019s going to sell what\u2019s left of the property and move into the city with the proceeds. Austin, I think. Or Fredericksburg. Depends on the prices. I\u2019ll have to move there, too. So will you. A real home, like what we had before mom left. Grandma tell you about that?\n\u2014No.\n\u2014Well, when she does, sound surprised.\n\u2014I didn\u2019t like our home with Mom.\n\u2014It will be better this time. Promise.\n\u2014Okay.\nWe drove on, and it was real quiet for a while. I think I played with the console on the dash, and started some old game like checkers, or something. I lost at it, playing against the old truck. I never beat the truck.\nThen I got bored and leaned back and watched the road passing. Dad didn\u2019t say anything, either.\nWe stopped to recharge the old cells, and I used the bathroom while we waited. Dad\u2019s card was bad, so he had to pay cash. People always thought that was weird, but cash didn\u2019t show up in divorce proceedings, usually, so he kept as much as he could get from his jobs in cash, and he ran his cards up to the edge when he was out drinking, so they were hardly ever good. We had time, and he bought burritos and kale chips for us, some bottles of water. Dad finally spoke.\n\u2014You ever see a salt gator?\n\u2014No.\n\u2014I have. I sure have. I was lying out on a beach one night, I was just, you know, doing my thing. One of these big ass gators comes up out of the water. It walked past me like it was just some guy going to his car after a day on the beach. No hello, nothing. It walked up to a bit of the dunes and was back in the reeds and sand for the night. You watch out for salt gators.\n\u2014I\u2019ll watch out.\nI took a bite of my burrito. It was too hot.\n\u2014They hunt in the bay. They didn\u2019t used to be so common, but times change. Get worse before they get better.\n\u2014Okay.\n\u2014Maybe they stay out where they aren\u2019t supposed to be and evolve to stick. How\u2019s the burrito?\n\u2014Too hot.\nHe took it and ate it like it was his. Grandma wasn\u2019t there to see. He gave me his kale chips without even talking about it first, like everything was his to give and take, and I guess it was, now. We went back to the truck that was almost done charging.\nBy midday, we were out on the sandbar islands, and it was so hot I couldn\u2019t believe anyone came here without air conditioning. They must have been crazy people.\nWe didn\u2019t have a place. Dad just drove us straight down the side of the beach until the road ended and kept driving on the shifting sands.\nHe pulled to a stop where we were all alone, way out away from anything but sand and sea oats and bugs and heat.\nHe pitched a tent in the bed of the truck, and told me to go on swimming.\nI changed in the cab, into my suit. I walked out to the water, and it was so cold, and there were mosquitos everywhere but the water. I hated it.\n\u2014Go on, Wind.\nAnd I hated it, but I didn\u2019t want to go back, so I went out into the water, and I swam, and I kept swimming straight out. I heard him calling my name, shouting at me, but I was a strong swimmer and I wasn\u2019t afraid of salt gators, and I kept swimming. I wasn\u2019t afraid of anything.\nDad was pissed, now, screaming at me to turn back. I saw boats on the horizon, and the long, long arm of the great gulf sea wall.\nI kept on, ready to let the salt gators take me, or one of the jellyfish that still tangled up the occasional swimmers with stinging pain in these old sandbar shores. I pretended that I was a salt gator. My mother was gone, now, and she was going to a new world, like she said, and I was staying here in the dunes, making do. The salt gator ancestors devoured dinosaurs, until they ate them all, and then they ate river fish until those got too dirty, and now they\u2019ve swept out to sea smaller, leaner, and ready to eat whatever comes next. I was going to be a salt gator, I decided. I was going to shed my skin in the water, come back tough and scary and ready to devour all the dinosaurs, all the dogs, all the world. Let them come for me if they dare, and I\u2019ll bite and kick and eat them all up.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue33\/3lbe33_story5.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"When it was all over and settled, I wasn't even called to court this time.

He\u2019s over-hot, pressed too close to the vent, but it\u2019s hard for him to resist the warmth. His old bones call for it, he says.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been asleep forever,\u201d I tell him, because I am bored and restless and my bones are still strong. I feel that we\u2019ve been in this place for a long time.\nJust as he says, \u201cYou don\u2019t know forever, girl,\u201d the call finally reaches us. A shatteringly low sound that vibrates sediment up from the floor and stings at my nose and eyes. Come, it says. It\u2019s time to move. It\u2019s time to eat.\nAround me, everyone stirs at once. Still limbs unstick themselves.\n\u201cFinally,\u201d my father says, \u201cone of you young things made yourselves useful.\u201d I say nothing to this. We gather ourselves and we go.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nOnce there was a creature like us who lived on the surface of the sea, a bright and beautiful thing. He had warm skin and flat teeth that had never needed to tear hide because the bounties of the world dropped into his mouth almost before he could open it. He\u2019d made a quick million in stocks and now he and his family were able to float along like oil and loose fat, surrounded by the water of the world but apart from it. He\u2019d brought his father and mother along, too, to repay them for all their years of toil.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMy father praises the cousin who found it, and she sways in place and says nothing.\nI\u2019m too young to go out in search of whales, but soon I will not be. I wonder if I should ask my cousin for advice. She looks, right now, like she wouldn\u2019t give it.\n\u201cEat, then,\u201d my father says, and we set to.\nIt\u2019s so strange! It\u2019s been long and longer since I sank my teeth into something other than rock and mud, and to feel the skin break and clots of flesh spread along my tongue brings a rush of warmth to my head. I eat until my jaw tires and still I\u2019m not full.\nWhen I finally wrench my head back, pulling strings of skin from my teeth, my cousin is crouched next to me, watching. She does not eat.\n\u201cHow did you find it?\u201d I say.\nShe is silent for a time. Then she says, \u201cI went mad from hunger. When I saw it settle, I thought at first that I had finally died.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d I say. On my other side, another cousin swats at an ambitious hagfish with the flat of her hand, hissing. Her mouth is full of meat.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cTell me what I can do to help you,\u201d the creature\u2019s father said, and the creature said: nothing, nothing. There\u2019s nothing more in the world than this.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cI see,\u201d I say, though I don\u2019t. I\u2019ve known only my father and my cousins and the warmth of the vents, the press of bodies all around me.\nMy father is restless. It\u2019s nearly time for us to go \u2014 for some to go to the ground and some of the younger cousins to go in search of other whalefalls. Maybe it\u2019s time for me to go. For the first time, I feel a spark of fear.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be all right,\u201d my cousin says. \u201cYou\u2019re fast and strong.\u201d I think she\u2019s lying, perhaps to comfort me, but it\u2019s hard to say.\nMy father pets the back of my skull. \u201cYou\u2019ll do us proud,\u201d he says. \u201cFind a beast big enough to sustain us for years, like I once did. It\u2019s in your blood.\u201d\nThat\u2019s another one of his stories. I\u2019ve heard it many times.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nOne day, the creature\u2019s father confronts him, far away where the creature\u2019s children cannot see. \u201cYou think you\u2019re so much better than me,\u201d the creature\u2019s father says. \u201cLike you had it so hard \u2014 like I was a thing you had to overcome.\u201d\nNo, the creature starts to protest, but by then it\u2019s too late. The creature\u2019s father is pushing him, is shaking him by the shoulders. There\u2019s some expression in his father\u2019s face, but the creature can\u2019t interpret it, because the creature\u2019s foot slips on slick wood and then he is floundering, falling away. He\u2019s falling forever, through the salt sea and into the abyssal dark. Somewhere in his fall, he forgets to breathe air. His heart grows hard and cold.\nNever again, the creature vows.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBefore I go, my father reaches out and squeezes my shoulder. \u201cDo me proud,\u201d he says. \u201cA father\u2019s greatest wish is to see his child surpass him.\u201d\n\u201cI will,\u201d I say, \u201cI\u2019ll find a treasure like no one\u2019s ever seen befor\u2014\u201d but when I look into his eyes they seem cold.\nI wish immediately that I had not said it.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue33\/3lbe33_story6.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"We are deep-water creatures, adapted to live in the crushing cold.

I didn\u2019t want to look up but I could feel her standing there, could see the chipped black polish on her quick-bitten thumbnail from the corner of my eye.\n\u201cThanks.\u201d I met her gaze, seafoam green, the softest thing about her. She pulled her lower lip between her teeth and let it go; there was nothing sexual in the gesture but my cheeks burned anyway. The swell of voices ebbed and flowed around us as students crossed the courtyard. From my usual perch on the dry fountain in the corner I could almost close my eyes and hear the sea, the rise and crash of waves and below them, far below, the faintest whisper of my name\u2014\n\u201cI heard they found his boat.\u201d\nThe dull throb of blood in my cheeks grew hotter. I stood up from the concrete lip but suddenly Liv\u2019s hand was on my arm. It was the first time she\u2019d ever touched me, the first time I\u2019d seen her touch anyone, and the shock cut my breath like drowning. She leaned in close enough that I could see the places her dark eyeliner had clotted on her lashes.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know where it took him? The storm?\u201d\nI pulled my arm away, stumbling backwards with my own momentum; through the ice that filled my lungs I managed, \u201cFuck you.\u201d\n\u201cI can help you!\u201d Liv called as I plunged into an eddy of freshmen.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nYears passed in the sky before my father pointed at a small dark whorl far below, a shadow in the water. Grinning he took my hand and angled bare feet to send us down, down, and the shadow grew clearer, made itself a shape, no rock or seal but a dead man\u2019s swollen head.\nI struggled to yank my arm away as salty rot splashed up into my face, but my father held me fast against his side as he sank his teeth into his own corpse\u2019s cheek. Because I couldn\u2019t watch I stared past him into the water and there, deeper than light\u2014a flash of pale green eyes.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cI could do it for cheap.\u201d\n\u201cDo what.\u201d Again I didn\u2019t want to look at her. Again my head turned against my will, drawn into her cold and breathless orbit as grass tickled the bare skin of my thighs beneath my skirt. Liv kept her mouth thin and solemn but her eyes shone bright.\n\u201cBring him up before he goes too bad.\u201d And then, as if I weren\u2019t already pale as codgut, \u201cYour father.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve always been less of an asshole than some.\u201d\nI turned my face back up to the sky. My throat was thick, vision hazy. \u201cSo buy me a soda.\u201d\n\u201cSure. Although I should warn you, nights will only get worse. Next time you\u2019ll take a bite of him yourself. Pepsi or Coke?\u201d\nThe class bell clanged before I found my words. But I tracked her after school.\nLiv drove a car even older and more battle-scarred than mine. Which was saying something, considering Dad had driven the Volvo all the way from Virginia back in the \u201970s. He\u2019d picked up a smear of every state along the way but Liv\u2019s rust had the grimy, sunbaked perfection of a museum piece. I caught her with one arm exposed, about to pull the door shut and close herself inside; for a second it wasn\u2019t Liv at all but a long, slender spider retreating into a hole in the sand.\n\u201cWait.\u201d\nLiv did, her fingers on the door. She didn\u2019t crane her head to see me, didn\u2019t twist her torso from the car. When I made it to her side she was gazing at her fingernails, or maybe at her hand, turning her palm this way and that. I knew then that she wouldn\u2019t tell me, not for cheap. Not for cheap at all.\n\u201cWhat do you know about my father?\u201d\n\u201cHop in. I\u2019m feeling waffles.\u201d Liv slid her gaze towards mine without lifting her head, a funny shyness to it that was probably as fake as her box-black hair. I couldn\u2019t tell for certain. Nothing had seemed entirely real for weeks. I got in the car.\nWe left the school parking lot in a haze of muted, golden light. The summer days were long enough my mother wouldn\u2019t expect me back for hours and hours, if she had me in her head at all.\nI thought, I should be careful, but Liv\u2019s car smelled like rain. Not sharp, not of salt. It gave me space to close my eyes and let her drive, the silence between us as frail and delicate as her gauzy black sleeve.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cSo,\u201d Liv said when we sat, and slapped her laminated menu onto the table between us. \u201cWhipped cream or no?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to push her, could sense the kind of life that hummed and snapped beneath her skin\u2014how she would be quite capable of causing pain. \u201cBut they make the whipped cream themselves.\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d\nShe flagged a waitress who knew me and ordered waffles with whipped cream and a vanilla milkshake. Two cherries. The waitress put her hand on my shoulder before she left, squeezed once; I had to fight the urge to run outside and flail my arms until I shook her pity off. Liv watched my face, or searched it, thoughts darting across her gaze like minnows in sunny water.\n\u201cWell?\u201d I asked when I couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. For a second I thought she\u2019d put me off again, find another trick to play, but instead Liv\u2019s lips curved into something sharp and narrow. No pity there. Under that smile I could breathe.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s in the dark. Way down. Almost too far to reach.\u201d\n\u201cAre you saying\u2026 is he alive?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Her answer, swift and definitive, didn\u2019t hurt me like I thought it might. But something did change inside my chest, a sort of giving. Cardboard finally crumpling underneath a weight.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand. What am I\u2014the dreams? And what you said.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not alive,\u201d Liv said again. She put her elbows on the table and leaned closer, all angles. The waitress clicked back and swept a platter of waffles down between us, the milkshake. Two cherries. Two straws. \u201cBut,\u201d and Liv took one thick straw between her fingers and bit it lightly with her teeth, eyes on mine. \u201cThere\u2019s a place where he isn\u2019t dead either. That\u2019s where you go at night. That\u2019s where he wants you to stay. But I\u2019ll be honest with you. It\u2019s not him you visit. Or it won\u2019t be, soon enough.\u201d\nShe never offered me the second straw. I wouldn\u2019t have taken it. But that second cherry sat atop the thick, foamy head of her milkshake all the way to the bottom.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nLiv picked up a piece of chicken and inspected it, the sanitary cafeteria light stealing all the green from her eyes and turning them as alien as the fish scales not yet faded from her hands.\nShe said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have a lot of time.\u201d\nI placed the tip of my fork against a chicken finger, stabbed it slowly. Took a bite. Too much breading, not enough meat.\n\u201cMen aren\u2019t so good with tides, you know? I\u2019d give it another day or two. Not more than three.\u201d\nThe coleslaw was awful too, so much mayonnaise I couldn\u2019t taste the vinegar.\n\u201cWe can do it at your house if you want.\u201d\nMy mother on the couch in her underwear, a liter of wine half-drunk at her elbow, unable to stand even if she wanted to?\n\u201cNo. Not my house.\u201d\n\u201cMine, then.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about your parents? Do they know\u2014all this?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. Can you come tonight?\u201d\nI sucked my apple juice, throat still tacky with slaw. Nodded while I drained the box. Liv smiled as my stomach clenched and coiled: all that sugar. She said she\u2019d drive. It was so easy to let her.\nWe left before school ended, cutting out of study hall with the smokers. Liv seemed like the type to smoke but she only led me through their butt-littered shortcut through the woods behind the football field. I trailed my fingers along rough trunks and soft young ferns, trying to feel the plants in a way that would linger past this moment, but those sensations were too difficult to keep. Everything was too difficult to keep except the marks Liv left when her gaze skated across my skin. The memory of flying. The smell of rot and brine.\nWe looped back to the parking lot and took her car north along the coast, past my neighborhood, past the larger marina, all the way up to the cliffs. Something tugged at my chest as we drove, a fishhook pulling me back, but Liv drove faster than the line.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nLiv stood next to me, our toes inches from the edge. She seemed horribly delicate against the empty air but her sleeve whipped my forearm like fire coral every time the wind clawed away from the rocks.\n\u201cHere,\u201d she said, pulling me back outside myself. In her hand a shard of obsidian caught the light. \u201cYou know how this works?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a cutter.\u201d I\u2019d seen other students eyeing my arms in the weeks after the storm. Curious. Expectant even. But Liv only smiled and pressed the shard into my hand.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t hurt for long.\u201d\nThe chunk of black glass weighed down my palm, warm from her fingers, its dorsal edge so keen the final centimeter glowed a muddy yellow: my own skin showing through from underneath. Something coiled within me, a kind of recognition.\n\u201cIf you do this with me,\u201d Liv said, \u201cyou won\u2019t be the same.\u201d A gull shrieked, four more answered.\n\u201cBut he\u2019ll be back? He\u2019ll be safe?\u201d\nA nod.\n\u201cSay it out loud.\u201d My vision blurred around her face, a wave of vertigo that sent me swaying towards the cliff. For the first time I grabbed her, the obsidian edge just missing her arm. Liv didn\u2019t flinch and suddenly I wanted her to, the wanting hot and tight inside my belly and that pain was good, almost perfect. \u201cSwear to me!\u201d\n\u201cYour father back and safe, your mother like you\u2019ve dreamed her, and all this yours to keep. Or I swear I\u2019ll jump off this cliff tomorrow.\u201d With every word she spoke my vision cleared, stabilized, narrowed in around the shapes her pale lips made as she promised me. Past her the gulls were fighting in a blur of wings and noise. Liv took my wrist in both her hands, cradled my palm like a fragile and valuable thing.\n\u201cNow,\u201d she whispered, and pressed her mouth against my knuckles where they curved around the glass. Then she pushed my arm up until that keen edge kissed my throat below my ear. \u201cYour turn. You know what I need you to say before we begin?\u201d\nAnd with my chest so full of churning life, the open air before us impossibly large, I did.\nI told her, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI tried to think of what we\u2019d done, how I\u2019d gotten home, but it wasn\u2019t there. My mind had been filleted, everything after that windy cliff plucked out.\nIn the shower pinpricks marched along my spine, across my chest. I looked down to find faint pockmarks on my skin: itchy crescents in strange patterns on my shoulders, my forearms, one fragile swath beneath my breasts. Fear, cold and sweet as rain, collected in the divots on my belly. Water stung my throat but a scar had already formed beneath my jaw, a single white line like a solitary gill.\nDownstairs I found my mother flipping pancakes with two butter knives. One earring, sea glass set in silver, dangled by her jugular. The other ear was bare. When I spoke, I heard my own voice as if across a long and empty room.\n\u201cI need to stay home today. I think I\u2019m sick.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t look sick.\u201d\nExcept she didn\u2019t turn to see. She sounded normal, sober, but then I watched my mother try to lift a pancake with the butter knives. She dropped it on the floor, scrabbled for another without a second glance. My knees turned queasy-weak; I blinked and there were no butter knives, no pancake on the floor. I poured myself into a chair and scratched my arms, the webs between my fingers.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not the law around here.\u201d My mother turned and pointed over my head with a normal spatula. \u201cAsk your father!\u201d\nHers was the distant voice now, muted by the water in my ears. Seafoam eyes swam in the gleaming silver of our teapot. The rest of our kitchen went splotchy, unfamiliar, like a watercolor of a place you almost recognize.\nThe bargain took, Liv said inside my head. Cold fingers brushed against my thighs. Don\u2019t worry, cold lips on my cheek. My promise stands. I\u2019ll help you get used to the dark.\nFootsteps slapped against the linoleum at my back. I tried to turn but the room dissolved into a thick and briny fog; all around me the sea swelled up, crashed down, birthed and killed and birthed again.

So, like other privileged girls at other privileged schools we took a trip one year to the great art museum in the Pahl, uptree from the ritzy shops of Upper Marbol.\nThe cable that had run directly from Taenil Heights to The Pahl was already shut down in an early sign of our city\u2019s decline. So we had to walk downtree to Mnessil, on the twisting stairways, to catch a cable car across. Crumbling manors gave way to smaller homes, to tight-packed shops with apartments above them, but the sharp metal spikes of the railings didn\u2019t change. How those nuns watched us, their little chicks, as we marched from the station through the oil-covered cable yard and into a car. I remember noticing the thick rust on the cables as we climbed in and wondering if the cable would snap. It was idle curiosity, maybe even desire. Not fear.\nThe air filled with black smoke and the smell of burning oil as we pulled away from our tree and across the open air toward the Pahl. The bass roar and punctuating shrieks of the car made it hard to talk, but most of the other students tried anyway. I did not. I pictured our car lying below in the waters of Beyond, smashed liked the limbs of Fallen Crown. I tried to imagine what position my body would end up in down there, beneath the shallow water.\nThe cable car took us directly to the front of the art museum. Houses spread around the tree beside the cable station, buildings much like those in Taenil Heights only larger and kept in better condition. They were old, though \u2014 each one could have been a museum in any of the other neighborhoods; here they housed the useless ranks of minor ministers.\nThe actual museum stood out from the trunk, curving around out of sight of the branch where we disembarked. Its fa\u00e7ade was towering, ancient and decayed. It stood right in the groin of a branch and the trunk, but the front extended well out onto the branch with a simple rectangular structure that bored us even before we had seen the first piece of what our teachers considered \u201cart.\u201d Several of my classmates managed to slip off into the shadows of the other houses, waiting to go downtree to Upper Marbol and its quaint shops and dangerous boys. But the nuns caught on before many could escape. They ushered us inside.\nMost of the art there was old, passive, decaying. Maybe not literally rotten \u2014 though my mind seems to remember a distinct smell of moldering wood, an odor I would expect in Ironwood or Stump, not in the Pahl \u2014 but artistically, philosophically as stagnant as the waters around Fallen Crown.\nNot that I would have said any such thing at the time, but even as a teenager I knew I didn\u2019t like them. I was looking for something more. So while my classmates disappeared down side hallways to kiss each other or strangers, I wandered the endless halls of paintings.\nSoon I was deep below-trunk, into passages few people walked, though I saw a couple of selichi, their pencil-thin bodies bending around the corner ahead of me. When I turned the corner, they were nowhere in sight. Instead my eyes focused on a single painting that alone occupied the left-hand wall.\nFour figures stood on a narrow branch, three conversing with each other and the fourth, with its back to the viewer, seeming to look off into the distance. But these figures were not people \u2014 not humans, not selichi, not even ratites \u2014 though they had human heads. Their bodies were nothing more than frames made of metal. Oil glistened at their shoulders and pelvic joints, a drip from one forming a black pool in the wood at their feet, and rust tarnished their limbs.\nThe three appeared so deep in conversation that they failed to notice a creature climbing among their limbs. The creature reminded me of a squirrel, but far too small to be the kind of domestic squirrel that the ministers of Droyess ride about their neighborhood. And yet it didn\u2019t quite resemble the smaller wild squirrels either. Maybe it was a construct as well, and its fur hid clockwork parts.\nIt seemed to me, though that the creature was a danger to those constructs, that this was its importance among them. It showed their fragility there on the branch, the frailty of their rusted metal parts.\nBut after all, it was the constructs themselves that most struck the teenage me. There was so much more to the painting, but my eyes always came back to those constructs, and later they were all I could recall.\nThey were exactly the way I saw everyone around me, with their oblivious heads and mechanical bodies. Every one of my classmates blindingly did whatever was expected of them \u2014 if not by the adults, then by whatever persona they had adopted \u2014 and all teachers, my parents, every adult I knew did just the same. They rusted, their lives leaked away, and they knew nothing.\nBut even more, I knew it was me. I was falling also into their mechanical pattern of life, the me I knew dying slowly, turning into a construct like these. I looked again at the title. It didn\u2019t look to me like they foresaw anything, but I did. It was not too late for me to do something about it.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI survived on what little I could steal, selling it for Iron Twigs or simply bartering it directly for food.\nBut now I\u2019d learned of a miner who came into some money and moved not far downtree from where I\u2019d grown up. I never knew where the money came from and never cared, but I decided to pay his house a visit.\nI made my way to the only cable car station in Fallen Crown, where citizens gather every day hoping to escape. The officials stood at the head of the line, questioning each of us. I slipped in behind a tall ratite with the build of a dominant male of their species. He looked at me with his beady eyes, then turned his beak back forward.\nThe line dragged as the day warmed and we stewed in each others\u2019 stinks. The officials rejected far more than they accepted, letting through those few with legitimate proof of work outside and a handful of others \u2014 for no reason any of us waiting could ever determine. But every day the gamblers gathered hoping it would be their turn.\nFinally the ratite in front of me stepped forward to the waiting official and I took a deep breath to free myself from the tang of ratite feathers. That was a mistake. If I had expected clean air, I was disappointed. The stink of Fallen Crown sparked a coughing fit that only ended when I stepped up to the young official who had just dismissed my ratite friend. The birdman shot me an angry look as he walked away, as if my coughing had prejudiced the official against him.\nThe young official smiled when I stepped up, not a pretty smile in that disproportioned face, but I smiled back. We knew each other. More than once he had stayed in whatever house or bed I called mine when his duties kept him in Fallen Crown overnight. But he was being watched by a pompous minor minister, so we pretended I was getting through for legitimate business.\nThe minister looked me over, his eyes lingering well below my face. But he said nothing as I walked by him and into a waiting cable car.\nWhen the car was full, it pulled away with a rusty screech. The cable \u2014 just as now, the only one out of Fallen Crown \u2014 went directly to Ironwood, which made for an easy route to Mnessis, just uptree from there. I walked the climbing streets as one neighborhood shifted into another.\nIn Mnessis I waited until dark.\nDid I worry about being observed? No. Unless you go to Droyess or the Pahl, the police don\u2019t even notice one more lost person on the branches, even today. So much has changed, but not that.\nThe miner\u2019s house was large, nice by miner standards. Although larger dwellings lined the thick limbs through there, the lowest on the tree, he had chosen the prestige of a house built against the actual trunk, which suited my plans. Like most buildings built into any of the four trunks of Boskrea, it had its decaying corner. I simply had to find where the wood had rotted sufficiently and break through, a quiet enough job in most parts of Boskrea.\nBut when I stepped through the hole I\u2019d made into a darkened hallway, there it was, the painting.\nIn the light of my handful of glowing fungus, I studied the painting that had turned me from a respectable doom to the life I now led.\nWhat struck me first was how little the figures now seemed. In ten years they had grown in my mind to encompass most of the canvas, but now I saw how they only filled a small piece of the whole, even if that piece lay near the center.\nThe light of my fungus could not reveal any color, but I saw the shapes on the painting. The constructs stood on a branch, a thin one, so that from the perspective of the painting I could see the bottom of the branch as well. Far below I thought I could see the stagnant waters that surround Boskrea. No branches filled that vast emptiness between the one they stood on and Beyond. But as I followed the branch over to the left where houses stood out from the trunk, I noticed something I hadn\u2019t seen in the museum. The branch ended before the trunk.\nIt was as if Scolyard were telling me that the only thing that kept them from plunging to their deaths was their own obliviousness. This I realized was their doom, not the inconsequential animal that played within their rusted parts. In the light of the fungus, the break in the branch was especially obvious, and I had the distinct impression that the painting was trying to tell me something. Some meaning lay there.\nToo late, I realized the truth. My doom also came upon me in my obliviousness as the miner tackled me and held me down until the police arrived.\nBoskrean prisons are not kind to a fallen girl from Fallen Crown. I spent years forgotten by what passes for a justice system in tunnels deep inside the trunk of downtree Ironwood. They were years of distant lights, sporadic food, and things I choose to forget. The occasional release so we could sweat over some manual task, turning great wheels or pulling loaded platforms up from below. Who knows, I might be there still if not for Pieter Wit.\nYes, the Pieter Wit. The outlaw artist himself freed me. Stole me, you might say. It was for nothing special in me that he did it. He was wandering through the tunnels, a forged key in one hand, and wearing a rain-soaked overcoat that reached down to his shoes. Maybe he\u2019d ducked into the tunnels to dry out. Maybe he was looking for something specific to add to his art, though what he might expect to find down there, I don\u2019t know. Whatever the case, like his art, I was simply something he found \u2026 and stole. And stolen, I became one of his group of helpers and apprentices.\nIn my first job for Pieter, we helped him erect one of his sculptures. We all arrived separately over the afternoon and evening in Upper Marbol, each of us carrying some small item Pieter had earlier stolen. I had in my pocket an ornamental knife from a selichi temple to their god Crait. It made me nervous, on edge, to carry something so clearly stolen that close to the selichi community of Marbol.\nI wandered from shop to shop always looking over my shoulder. The sharp spears of the shop awnings constantly brought to mind the sharp tips of selichi weapons. The afternoon dragged by, and darkness brought me no relief. I kept expecting a selichi priest to step out of the narrow shadows of dead lampposts and grab me.\nI was walking cautiously down a dark side street when I got the sense that someone was near. I whipped around and saw nothing. I turned back and sped toward the main route where some of the streetlamps were still working.\nThe feeling grew. I stopped suddenly, but no sound came to me except my own echoes and the sounds, farther off, of Upper Marbol night life \u2014 music in the upscale clubs and the shouts of people high on expensive mushrooms.\nI started walking again, this time slowly, looking carefully into every shadowed doorway. Suddenly and silently a figure appeared beside me.\nI stifled a scream. Instead it was Pieter\u2019s voice that broke the silence. \u201cWell done. Most don\u2019t even suspect someone is there.\u201d\nHe said nothing more but walked soundlessly beside me to the square where we had all planned to meet.\nThe others were already there, and Pieter immediately began to create his sculpture from the objects each of us had smuggled in.\nTo watch him work was always a treat, a bit of magic. He would set all the items out before him and carefully select one at a time to create a surreal statue of nothing. Don\u2019t ask what he used to bind the pieces together \u2014 he never let anyone know that mystery. And no, I have no idea where he might be hiding today or what his next work will be.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAmong the stately houses of Droyess beside what by then were the last living branches and green leaves in all of Boskrea, is Nothpy & Vandeker\u2019s, the great art house where the city\u2019s twelve Major Ministers purchase their art. The house would often get their hands on Pieter\u2019s installations and auction them off to ministers\u2019 chambers or banks\u2019 lobbies. Pieter never got a twig from the sale, but he never minded. When Pieter heard that they planned to sell one of his early works that had broken as two pieces, each as \u201cauthentic Pieter Wit,\u201d though, he decided to stop them.\nWe slipped into Droyess traveling uptree from the emptiness of Scarltry. It\u2019s strange to move up the trunk and through the branches where there are no houses, no buildings at all and never have been. Only herds of giant, domesticated squirrels and flocks of birds. Nowhere else in all of Boskrea is like that, so desolate. And this is what makes Droyess difficult to sneak into. Whereas the other neighborhoods each blend into the next, Droyess is alone, almost a city to itself. It shares its tree only with the wilds of Scarltry, and far downtree the neighborhood Wray, which is hardly more than a cable car station and a couple of houses clumped together for the Scarltry farmers and herders.\nBut Pieter could move anywhere, and the two of us with him seemed blessed by his shadow. Some things I won\u2019t tell about Pieter, some secrets he would want kept. There\u2019s nothing arcane, though, in what he does. We moved from shadow to shadow, deliberately though not slowly. At the edge of the neighborhood, he led us over a garden wall, through the shadows of sculpted lichen, and into the branches of Droyess.\nA bright light shone on the entrance to the auction house, but the light was steady, and the shadows plentiful. We slipped inside without alerting anyone.\nPieter found the pieces of his sculpture right away and laid it before him. Then slowly he moved about the building, stealing random items from shelves along with several small sculptures and paintings from other artists. Returning to his earlier work, Pieter began to assemble a new sculpture, one that wouldn\u2019t break \u2026 nor likely fit back out the door.\nWhile he worked, I wandered. And there, in one corner among the lesser works the auction house hoped to sell was the painting. My heart raced. The last time I had seen it I had been arrested. Surely it was an omen, a warning of my doom.\nThis time I did not spend long minutes studying the painting. I fled. One image had burned itself into my mind though, one impression as I crept back to the wilds of Scarltry, this time without Pieter\u2019s shadow. As I ran I saw the buildings of Droyess become the buildings of the painting, not logically arranged but surreal. Where the branch failed to touch the tree, crooked buildings sprang out like crystals, each one proportionally correct on its own, but pushing out from the trunk in strange ways.\nThe buildings ran all the way up the left side of the canvas, crowded close together. The perspective didn\u2019t fit with the rest of the picture, but the shift was subtle. That slight sense of being off-kilter was what burned in my mind then. As if the whole of Boskrea were preparing to shift toward me, to come after me. In short, my doom.\nI was convinced as I stumbled down the branch streets into the squirrel lands that Pieter Wit was doomed, that he would soon be arrested and destroyed. This time, I told myself, the painting had warned me off.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI could easily have returned then to the dregs of Boskrea, but I had learned some things in my years with Pieter, and I put these to use. Through Pieter I had come to understand art, at least his kind of art. I couldn\u2019t create it myself, but I got it, you know?\nI moved to the area just below jagged peaks of Stump \u2014 Tam Sledge the locals still call that part of Stump, the name it had before Fallen Crown fell. It\u2019s a crowded neighborhood though most of the people work outside of Stump. I opened a small gallery there, a gallery of real art \u2014 active, dynamic and controversial. I shocked my comfortable neighbors, but many snuck back later when they thought no one was looking.\nNot that I made tons of Iron Twigs or anything, you understand. There may be thousands of people living in Tam Sledge, half a million or more in Stump, but the taste for good art is still rare. I scratched by.\nAnd so, you\u2019re thinking, Scolyard\u2019s painting came one day into my gallery? No. I had nothing to do with such passive art, no paintings of any kind. Some sculptures I sold, those that seemed to speak on their own, to enter a conversation with my customers. Mostly I looked for art that would change, art that would dissolve and decay over time and become something new.\nNo, I have no idea what ever happened to \u201cThe Constructs Foresee Their Doom,\u201d or even if it ever left Nothpy & Vandeker\u2019s. Maybe it\u2019s still collecting dust in Droyess. But I did see it one last time, this time in a vision, beside the waters of Beyond.\nI had owned my shop for a couple of decades when I heard of a new painter, a new type of painting that wasn\u2019t so dead. Rumors spread about new dyes, or new ways to mix old ones, and about this painter \u2014 whose name the stories always left out \u2014 who did amazing things with the paint. Somehow, it was said, over time his paints would fade, nothing special about that except that this painter manipulated the different ways different paints will fade so that eventually the painting becomes something entirely new. Two reds that looked the same at first might each fade into a different shade, one that matched what had once been a brown, and one that remained a dull red. A portrait of a minister, in the first rumor I\u2019d heard, metamorphosed over a year\u2019s time into a landscape painting of the mists out over Beyond with the edge of one tree on the side, none of which had been visible in the original painting.\nThe rumors grew, as they will, and stories spread that other paintings continued shifting, not just once but continually over time. This was a painting I could accept in my shop; this was real art.\nI decided to seek it out.\nIt took time, connections I had never lost from my days in Fallen Crown. Eventually I tracked down the rumors to a clan of ratite dyers living beside the waters of Beyond in the lowest parts of Stump.\nI walked downtree through Stump into the gnarled paths of what had once been called Cron, a predominantly ratite community. The lower part of any of the trees is difficult to maneuver, and Stump maybe more than any others. The houses cling precariously out from the trunk with twisted pathways running down and around without any clear logic. There could be no doubt that I was a stranger there.\nBut I had lived in Fallen Crown, and even some three decades later I had no fear of any place. People looked at me from the porches \u2014 humans, ratites, a few selichi \u2014 and I looked back and kept walking.\nI smelled the dyers long before I saw them. They made various blues and purples, and the process involved rotting shellfish. I climbed down a jutting root and found them gathered around stinking vats of dye. Small boats carried other ratites out into the brackish water where I could see them diving and returning to the surface. Beyond the coracles was nothing but water \u2014 Fallen Crown and the other trees lay out of sight around the other sides of Stump. I had little time to study the sights. The dyers quickly moved to intercept me.\nIt was then, before I could explain myself, that I saw the vision. Out above the waters of Beyond I saw Scolyard\u2019s painting. Again I saw the four constructs in the center, the small creature wreaking havoc among their parts. Again I saw the branch that did not reach the trunk yet seemed to hang in the air effortlessly. And again I saw the buildings of our city shifted out of perspective and pushing out from the tree. But all these details faded into, or rather were consumed by the background, a poisonous green meant to be the waters of Beyond.\nAnd here beside the actual waters I saw that the color was accurate. The water dotted with small boats was exactly the poisonous color I could see in my vision, and it seemed to grow, to reach out and try to swallow me. I could feel myself falling into that green, drawn down into the painting itself.\nI came to with a splash. It was not the waters themselves I had fallen into but a dyer\u2019s vat. To this day I have no idea how I made it past the dyers or what exactly brought me down to the vats. The dyers pulled me out with their wing-like arms and pushed me violently away from their business. They yelled at me in their high-pitched voices, but I did not listen. I was still picturing the poisonous green of my doom.\nTime has passed. I went back to my gallery without the new, dynamic painting. And the rumors died soon after.\nNow I\u2019m dying. The doctors say it\u2019s a disease, maybe something I picked up so long ago in Fallen Crown, maybe a sickness from the prison tunnels of Ironwood. But I know the truth. It is no disease but a poison, a poison from the dyes perhaps but more importantly \u2014 even if less true \u2014 a poison of Scolyard\u2019s painting, a poison of Beyond, a poison of my city.\nMy doom. Boskrea\u2019s doom. They are the same.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue23\/3lbe23_story3.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"The most significant relationship of my life -- and I've led a long and strange one, a life poisoned and infected by my beloved, decaying, doomed city -- was with a man I never met.

She slipped on her bathrobe, the tattered plaid with the upchuck stains from Whitley, and peered out of the window.\nThey always migrated in pairs, lumbering through the bare cornfields, outlined against the stars. In bed, Jarrod would sigh and turn over and stop snoring for a while. It wasn\u2019t his fault; he couldn\u2019t sense them. Neither could the dogs. All the better.\nBut as her hair silvered and wrinkles webbed the corners of her eyes, they migrated more and more often. Six or seven times a year. Then ten or eleven. She tried to untangle her dreams. Visions from deep in the earth, simpler joys and deeper sorrows, rising through the soil into sunlight. Her bare feet sensed the rocks, the dirt, the family tree.\nOne night, the light came on in Whitley\u2019s bedroom, warning her of his sprouting mind. She went to find him by the open window.\n\u201cYou must not speak to them,\u201d she said, as he stared out at the huge moving shapes.\n\u201cWhat are they?\u201d\nRachel folded her arms around herself. \u201cYou can feel it, right?\u201d\nHe rubbed his shoulder. \u201cThey\u2019re a\u2014a part of the Earth?\u201d\nShe turned him away from the window.\n\u201cWhy are they so big?\u201d\n\u201cGo back to bed. We\u2019ll talk more in the morning.\u201d\nBut she didn\u2019t bring it up in the morning. She narrowed her eyes at him over their oatmeal, and he left to feed the pigs and the chickens. He liked the chickens, he\u2019d even named all of them\u2014hilarious, since they\u2019d soon eat them.\nThe less he knew, the better. She\u2019d existed so long alone before finding him, before harvesting him, a pebble in the night. Her little brother. If she told him too much, what if he couldn\u2019t stop wondering?\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nShe cried and said, \u201cYes, yes of course.\u201d He\u2019d figured it out at some point, it seemed.\nWhitley had taken to rubbing at his knees, as if he sensed the age in them and wondered at their elasticity. Maybe he\u2019d cottoned on after the fifteenth dog had died. Well, good thing she\u2019d never let him play with any kids or taken him into town. She\u2019d had enough trouble convincing the locals that she just looked very much like her mother. Her grandmother before that. And so on. A kid that age? They\u2019d run her out in no time.\nAfter Jarrod\u2019s funeral, she drove to town to buy essentials. She wanted apples to make a pie. A pie sounded nice, with some nice rough soil, maybe a deep vein of silver.\nDid Jarrod sense anything, buried in the richness of the earth? Or would he just decompose, isolated from the roots of the world? Ugh. Seeing death did this to her every time.\nThe giants rose in front of her. They lumbered through their neighbor Seamus\u2019s yet-to-be planted bean fields. They\u2019d never come in the day before.\nRachel pressed hard on the gas pedal and did not look, trying not to give away that she could see them. Their forms had solidified, no longer outlines against the sky, but living faces, like Mount Rushmore\u2014only more definition\u2014had stood even taller and gone on a jaunt. They turned their heads and watched her car pass. Maybe they would think was a strange beetle.\nShe got her pie ingredients with shaking hands and drove home as fast as she could. They were no longer in the neighbor\u2019s field, they had walked on\u2014\nNo. They were at her farm, leaning over the house.\nShe\u2019d watched them for so many years alone. But they could see Whitley now, and find him, even as she\u2019d tried to hide him. Idiot!\nShe stamped the gas pedal. Fishtailed into the gravel drive.\nWhitley, her smiling baby brother who named the chickens, who never complained. He must have daydreamed while doing chores. They only ever came when she couldn\u2019t sleep. They visited the wandering minds.\n\u201cWhitley!\u201d She shouted. He turned.\nThe giants turned, too.\n\u201cCome here. Get away from the house.\u201d\n\u201cThey go in pairs,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t they, Mom?\u201d The chickens milled around him, pecking at the dirt. He didn\u2019t notice. \u201cThey go in pairs, because they\u2019re lonely.\u201d\nRachel swallowed. \u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014that\u2019s not important. What\u2019s important is that you listen to me. Get off the ground.\u201d\nHe stepped towards her. The two giants swiveled their immense heads back and forth. One of them made a noise like a huge mill stone at work, trying to make words. She shuddered. Whitley rubbed at his shoulder, then his form shifted, his legs growing, pushing him higher, and his arms lengthening, and his neck elongating, and his chest expanding, and\u2014\nShe screamed and rushed to her brother\u2014his body no longer little. She couldn\u2019t lose him; she couldn\u2019t live on Earth without Whitley. She couldn\u2019t live alone again. Not again!\nThe half-dreams came clearer to her now. Her own body shifted and molted in response. Her skin grew, her organs, her bones all increased, just like she had always known would happen if she got too close to them. She shouted in protest, shouted in the language of stone, in that rattling grind of something once buried deep in the Earth, made of the Earth.\n\u201cIt is good to see you, children,\u201d her father said, \u201cSee you as you as you truly are.\u201d\n\u201cWe planted you both so very long ago!\u201d her mother said. \u201cWe have wandered the surface, waiting for you both to come of age. Now we have much to do.\u201d\nThe bigness of her form felt right, like being able to take a full breath, her feet connected to the deepness and solidity of Earth. Shaken loose of humanity. Now she had her family.\nWhat had she been so afraid of?","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue33\/3lbe33_story1.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"Sometimes in the night, when the dogs stopped barking at the cars along Route 40, the house ceased settling, and the wind came to a rest in the branches of the old maple by the farmhouse, Rachel sensed them.","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/SsfrveLWz6Ik7IyP-8CuR+iK5j8.json"}

The little mermaid\u2019s father was a king, she says. If he had not been netted and brought to shore, then he would still be King. The little mermaid doesn\u2019t think it matters much. Remembering doesn\u2019t make the cold waters warmer or shine light upon the depths.\nGrandmother never has a story to tell about the little mermaid\u2019s mother. She sits tall and proud on a throne of ancient lava pillows, surrounded by drifting marine snow. Twelve dead oysters still cling to her fish\u2019s tail, their meat rotted away from between crushed shells. She wears bone-hook earrings and a tiara of smooth, polished coral.\nThe little mermaid sits just below the throne, where the luminous inhabitants of the desert sea flit near and away, hunting in the ocean\u2019s refuse. She listens to her grandmother\u2019s stories of crystal waters and brilliant blue skies. She tries to imagine so much light, but all her mind conjures is the faint green glow of her gnarled and hungry neighbors.\nThe mermaid sleeps curled in the curve of an abandoned ship\u2019s anchor. She dreams of hot sunlight and foam flecked waves. She dreams of the cries of gulls and the creatures that cling tight to dry land like her grandmother does to the ocean floor.\nThe years drag by and she keeps her grandmother company through the creeping madness of age, until the old woman howls curses into the vastness of the sea. Perhaps Grandmother\u2019s three hundred years end there in the abyss, and the little mermaid is alone.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cMommy, why did the mermaid dance on knives?\u201d She has been reading the book of fairy tales you gave her for her fifth birthday, and only now do you think that perhaps you should have waited until she was a bit older.\nYou cannot think of an answer even though you know you should. Finally you say, \u201cBecause she loved the Prince.\u201d It\u2019s true in a way. Love is so often a function of how much you are willing to give up.\nLater, she plays in the yard and you watch out the window while you clean. The neighborhood children are not home and you wonder if you ought to call her friends\u2019 mothers. It isn\u2019t good for her to be alone so much.\nShe is dancing on the gravel, even though she stops every few steps and jumps into the cool grass of the front yard. You notice that it needs mowing. She steps back into the gravel and turns a pirouette, even though the rocks dig into the skin of her pretty little feet.\n\u201cChristina, what are you doing?\u201d\nShe puts her hands over her head and says, \u201cI\u2019m the little mermaid, mommy. I\u2019m dancing so I can be a princess.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nShe comes to the collapsed hulk of a ship. Those who owned it are long since eaten, and all that is left is porcelain, creaking wood and iron. The current still plays with tattered remnants of rope, with rusting bulkheads that fall in on themselves.\nShe swims to a door that is broken and stuck ajar. Her hands come away covered in rust like swirling blood. Half-covered in sand, she finds a porcelain doll\u2019s head, skull-like. She floats through staterooms and half-collapsed engines, turning over pieces of iron and broken shards of ceramic. The sea tastes bitter, thickly laden with metals.\nGrandmother told her stories about ships, of course, but she never said how big they were. The mermaid is frightened. Perhaps she swims back home to tell her grandmother what she has found, back over a fortnight of ocean, echoing with the far away sounds of life.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nYou haven\u2019t wanted to wear a bathing suit since Christina was born, so can you really blame him for wanting someone he can go to the beach with? He is so often away because you are too much for him. You cling, like free-floating kelp.\nHe is tired when he comes in the door. His suitcase is a black wheeled thing with a red ribbon tied around the handle, an attempt to differentiate it from the others.\nChristina is already in bed. You did not want her around when you spoke to him for the first time in weeks. \u201cHow was your trip?\u201d You have nothing to tell him about your daughter, his daughter, except that he has missed her birthday. You are sure that he already knows that, and you are not in the mood for an argument.\n\u201cGood,\u201d he says. He rummages in the fridge until he finds the leftovers from dinner. Cold steamed vegetables, salad and some rice pilaf that you made yourself. You could tell him exactly how many calories were in each and every cup of it.\n\u201cThis is it?\u201d He tosses the plastic container into the microwave. His metabolism is slowing and he is getting what he affectionately refers to as a beer belly. For an instant you see the prince you met on the beach in California, but only while he is turned away from you. You can almost imagine his back in a wetsuit instead of the pigeon-gray sport coat. He still eats like a prince.\nYou would apologize, but the words catch in your throat in the same way that, \u201cI love you,\u201d has been catching there for the past year.\nHe doesn\u2019t ask about Christina. You wonder if he is still thinking about the girls on the other coast. You wonder how old they are. You slip into living room and turn the flat screen on. Christina was watching nature shows earlier. Something about the coral reefs is playing, and the screen fills with murky blue and dancing fish. You turn to a sitcom and pretend that the laugh tracks are your own.\n\u201cI was thinking we could have chicken tomorrow,\u201d you say.\n\u201cWould you believe me if I told you that my department is still number one in sales for the company?\u201d he asks. He sits next to you on the couch, balances his dinner on his knee, puts an arm around you, turns the channel to a dirt bike race.\n\u201cYes,\u201d you say. \u201cI think that we should send Christina to a day camp next summer, where she can be around other kids.\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter how high they set the bar,\u201d he says. \u201cThe department will always pass with flying colors.\u201d\nYou don\u2019t say anything else, but you watch the dirt bikes circle the track. You think of knives made of stone and realize then that you are going to leave him.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nShe bobs there, alone in the moonlight. She sees boats pass far away in the shipping lanes, and overhead she hears the thrum of motors. This confuses her, as she always thought that motors and ships existed only on the water\u2019s surface. Grandmother never told her about planes or birds, because air was as foreign a concept as sunlight.\nThe mermaid submerges for a while, deciding to return when the sun has dawned and the shore will be more than a jagged silhouette of glowing lights.\nWhen she comes to the surface at morning, she finds that she is not alone and for a single fleeting moment she thinks that she has found mermen. She ducks her head and sees legs, and that they are holding tight to floating boards.\nHumans. Men.\nThey laugh and joke, their voices barely carrying over the sound of the waves crashing into sand. Dangerous, yes. She thinks of stories of men with nets and hooks and the will to capture her father. But she has come so many leagues since those stories, and men are far less scary to her eyes than sharks with their many rows of teeth or dolphins with their playful homicidal bent.\nThe mermaid smiles and swims near to them. She treads water with her arms, and her smile does not waver. These men are unarmed. These men are in her realm. She is very close before she can make out their words over the waves. She stays low in the water, and her black hair floats around her like weeds, obscuring what lies beneath.\n\u201cDid you swim all the way out here?\u201d he asks. His eyes are blue like the sky overhead. Striking, oddly beautiful. Beaded water drips down his face from wet hair, and for a moment, the mermaid can imagine that he is fish beneath the water.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she says, and the mermaid laughs at the idea that she may have come from the shore.\nHe opens his mouth to say something else, but his friend punches him in the arm. \u201cHey, Brendan. You\u2019ll miss the waves.\u201d\nAnd soon enough the moment breaks, as he heaves himself out of the water and onto the board. Instead of fins, he has two legs, and the mermaid is rolled in the turbulence of an early breaking wave. When she surfaces, he is gone to where she cannot follow.\nShe considers waiting when she sees him fall from the board. And what point would there be in that? She would only risk that he see her lack of legs.\nThe mermaid submerges, and swims down and away from shore. She could forget him, but she does not. Every time she closes her eyes, she sees his face, and every time she looks off into the distance, she thinks of the color of his eyes.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAnd when you leave, what will you have then?\nYou put the hairbrush down.\nHe comes in and wraps his arms around you from behind. \u201cSometimes when I\u2019m gone, I miss you so much that I feel like I\u2019m drowning,\u201d he whispers. \u201cAnd when we\u2019re together, you lead me out to sea again.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cGrandmother,\u201d the mermaid says. She curls in the sand and sea dust by her grandmother\u2019s tail, the twelve dead oysters, and the ship\u2019s anchor that once served her as a bed. \u201cGrandmother, I wish a favor.\u201d\nGrandmother laughs. \u201cA favor? Two legs and an eternity away from the sea is but a favor now? I shouldn\u2019t be surprised, your sisters all made the same mistake. They never returned to the sea, and never will.\u201d\nThe mermaid bows her head against the cold stone lava and waits. After some time, Grandmother\u2019 s tail drifts over her, stiff fin and oyster shells alternating smooth and rough over the little mermaid\u2019s back.\nGrandmother says, \u201cI cannot keep you from the land, child, as much as I wish I could. Pull yourself onto the earth when there is no light from sun or moon and you will have your wish and your prince.\u201d\nThe mermaid does not look up for a long time, and when she does, Grandmother gives her a narrow, jagged stone knife. \u201cBut take this, for the day will come when he has broken your heart. On that day, you will die and become nothing, for nothing can live without a heart. You have but to pierce him as he has done to you. Let his blood fall over your feet, and when you return to the sea, you will once more be as you are now.\u201d\nAt first, the mermaid can\u2019t believe that Grandmother would let her go. She looks up at the stone knife and at Grandmother\u2019s face. Joy numbs her and she trembles so much that she can barely take the knife. She knows that she will not need it.\nThe swim back to the shore where she met her prince feels short this time, as though there is no distance at all. A hook has been set into her heart, and she is pulled to land with no effort of her own.\nPerhaps she loves him and he her loves back until they both die of old age in the home where they raised their children.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBut all the same, when he comes home from the office, there are days when all you can think about is him in the arms of another woman.\nYou are loading clothes into washer when he comes home and stands between the laundry room and the kitchen. You would say, \u201cHello,\u201d but you choose not to. Instead, you load the clothes more slowly, so that you can avoid looking up. He owns your words.\n\u201cWho is he?\u201d\nA sock has fallen, you bend a little further and pick it up before the words fully register. In it goes, reunited with the load of underwear and towels. Meanwhile, your mind races over what he could possibly think, standing there. That you have the same tendencies as he does. That it would be anything other than just and fair if you slept around on him as he sleeps around on you.\n\u201cHe?\u201d You stand and brush the wrinkles out of your capris without thinking. \u201cHe who?\u201d\n\u201cHe whoever,\u201d he says. \u201cThe one you\u2019re with. The reason you\u2019re so distant. Don\u2019t play dumb.\u201d\nYou try to think of ways to tell him that the one you\u2019re with, the reason you\u2019re so distant, is him. But at the same time, you think that there probably isn\u2019t a way to say that without sounding cute. You\u2019re not trying to be clever, you\u2019re trying to tell the truth. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to tell the difference.\n\u201cI\u2019m not with anybody else,\u201d you say. And suddenly you think that you don\u2019t have any concrete evidence that he\u2019s sleeping around on you again. You only have the conviction that if he\u2019s done it before, he\u2019ll do it again. And what if you were being unfair? How would you tell Christina?\nThe future stretches in front of you in the silence between your words and his. You imagine looking for somewhere to stay. You imagine the prolonged divorce, the custody battle. You think about lying to Christina about why you left, because you will never stop wondering if this was a failure of your own ability to love more rather than his ability to love less.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t leave me,\u201d he says. \u201cI need you. We\u2019re meant to be together.\u201d He sounds so hurt when he says it that you feel for him.\nYou think of Christina, dancing on gravel as though she were stepping on knives.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d you say, but you\u2019re not sure who you\u2019re saying it to.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nUntil the day her prince does not come home, not that night or the next morning.\nWhen he does, it is nearly dusk. He doesn\u2019t smell of the salt sea. He smells of flowers, lavender. It is a flower that doesn\u2019t grow in the garden in front of his home, and a scent that the mermaid has never worn. She knows where he has been, though she cannot say what it is exactly that is so damning.\nThe mermaid kisses her prince to welcome him home, and she asks, so innocent, what flower it is that he smells of.\nAnd there is anger, sudden and hot, like a crack in the bottom of the sea. How dare she accuse him? After everything--everything--how dare she hurt him like this?\n\u201cWhat have I done to you?\u201d she asks. \u201cHow have I failed you? What have I done wrong?\u201d\nAnd at this opening, he tells her, in detail. With his words he paints a portrait so different than what the mermaid sees every day in her mirror that she at first cannot believe. But he is so vehement. He is so sure, and the mermaid begins to think that she must have been mistaken. She must be wrong about him, about her, about everything and so she apologizes once, twice, three times before he stops. He wraps his arms around her and promises-- never again--as long as she helps him.\nWhen he has gone to sleep, so early, alone, she sits at the little white wire table on the pool deck. The last slanting rays of the setting sun paint the back garden shades of red and orange. She discovers that mermaids can cry.\nShe weeps until the light in the garden shifts from sun-red to the white-blue of the moon. It is never cold where they live, but she shivers in the darkness anyway, turning her reality over in her head. She thinks that her heart is breaking, and that, as her grandmother said, it will kill her. She stands and walks over the still-warm pool deck to the house, to plush aquamarine carpets and carefully placed furniture, cleaned meticulously by his hired maid.\nThe stone knife is cold and rough under her fingertips.\nThe mermaid takes the knife from its case. She holds it before her, pointing out and down as she crosses the hard linoleum of the kitchen, her feet making soft thuds. She creeps into his room, timing the creak of the door hinges with his snores.\nHe sleeps on his back and she thinks about tracing her fingers down his cheek and kissing his neck.\nShe stands over her prince for what feels like hours in the darkness, listening to him breathe. Every time she makes her decision, every time her fingers tighten on the handle of the stone knife, she finds herself unable to move. There is such a memory of her hair wet on the pillow. Of his hands, rough from the surfboard. Of the year\u2019s thousand kisses, one each for morning, noon, and night. The baby kicks, and she wonders how a human child would fare if born to a woman remade half-fish.\nThe mermaid walks to the shore, even if every step feels as though she balances on the edges of blades. She throws the stone knife as far as she can, and she doesn\u2019t see where it lands. Perhaps she can still live with a broken heart.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nOne evening, you come home to a dark house. The blinds are not drawn and the windows gape like the open mouths of undersea caves. You assume the house is empty until you draw near enough to hear the soft sounds of a little girl crying, and then your hands tremble with adrenaline as you flip through your keys, fingers slipping too often.\n\u201cChristina?\u201d You leave the door open behind you, because you are not stupid and this situation has the same fear-sharp feeling that water gets when sharks circle near and hungry.\nShe cries louder, and you flick the entryway light on.\nChristina stands in the kitchen, bare feet grass-stained on the white-and-blue tiles. The kitchen drawers are all pulled out and every knife in the house is scattered over the floor.\nYou go to her, your feet placed in all the spaces between. You pick her up and she grabs tight to the shoulders of your dark green blouse.\nAnd Brendan?\nYou find your prince in the office room. He blinks and squints when the lights come on. He holds a knife to his neck. It is ridiculous in a way that would make you laugh if terror wasn\u2019t flooding up your spine. You wonder how long he sat there, waiting. Five minutes? An hour?\n\u201cI can\u2019t live without you,\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t do this to me.\u201d As if he knows about the stone knife you threw away.\nChristina has balled her hands into fists, and you balance her on one hip to reach for the door handle. She won\u2019t stop crying. Your throat is tight and you can\u2019t say a word as you pull the door closed and tiptoe backward down the hall.\nThe last you see of him are his eyes, blue and dark and unforgiving as the sea.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue26\/3lbe26_story6.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"The littlest mermaid has no mother.

Sweat poured down Cecilia\u2019s stomach as she dropped her skirt, a tangle of red lace, but it was too late and hands pressed in to touch her naked skin. Sam grabbed Cecilia by the waist, hoisted her over his shoulder, and marched out of Sin-\u00e9\u2019s, away from the leering crowd. Heat radiated from his body, but she pushed it away, kept his pulse apart from hers. Outside, he set her down, but kept hold of her hand, squeezing so hard that she squealed and tried to untangle from him.\n\u201cNot this time,\u201d he said, and dragged her down through the broken streets of Shandon and up into the hills, where the walls climbed even higher. Cecilia ignored him and didn\u2019t speak, let the night act as her barrier. Her free hand fluttered through the air.\nShe listened for the Bells of Shandon, hoping someone might climb the tower of Saint Anne\u2019s Church and play the song, but only the lapping of the River Lee answered. She\u2019d never sit in the pews and hear the service \u2014 Mum would forbid it. Mum forced them to walk three kilometers across Cork City to sit through Catholic Sunday service at Saint Finbarre\u2019s, where older women glared down their noses at Cecilia. Even now, after Sinead O\u2019Connor and her bald head and all her talk about the Pope.\n\u201cI saved you, Sam,\u201d Cecilia said, laughing, her voice a bell. \u201cMy body saved you.\u201d She ran her hand through her long brown hair, trailed her fingers along her torso. She fingered the lace of her skirt before gliding her hand on the air again. Sam didn\u2019t speak, only jerked her forward.\nWhen they got to their door, Sam stopped, shook her by the shoulders, and forced her to look at him.\n\u201cI gave you all the chances, little sister. At eighteen, you got no more sense in your head than when you were a baby. Mum\u2019ll do what she always said. You know, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nCecilia gazed at her brother, his chalky face pinched with red.\n\u201cYou want to get me because I stopped you. Because you can\u2019t have it. But don\u2019t let on, right? I can\u2019t help it. You know it, Sam.\u201d\nSam didn\u2019t answer, only stood with his hands clenched around her shoulders, before he sighed and steered her inside.\nInside the cluttered structure with peeling walls and threadbare carpet, their mum sat in an armchair, hands at work on an afghan. Sam shoved Cecilia into the chair next to her, but the woman only shook her gray head and remained focused on her knitting needles. Cecilia cast her eyes down, away from the sharp ends of her mother\u2019s instruments.\n\u201cShe\u2019s playing the Sheela again, Mum,\u201d Sam said, fists clenched at his side. \u201cShowed her sticky out in public. Got the devil in \u2019er.\u201d A vein trembled in the middle of his forehead.\n\u201cHe\u2019s tossed up bout nothing, honest, Mum. Mad bout something else.\u201d Cecilia smiled, but Sam shook his head and stomped out of the room.\nMum tsked, her knuckles white as she curled her fingers around the knitting needles. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we unravel the things we make. I\u2019ve had enough of your trouble, girl. Tomorrow we take you to work. You\u2019ll be rid of those demons quick.\u201d\n\u201cMum, it\u2019s not so wrong as all that. He was in a fight cause they didn\u2019t let him on the team. I didn\u2019t want him to get pummeled.\u201d Cecilia smoothed her hands against her skirt. Despite the cool air in the room, sweat rolled in rivers down her body.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a place for girls like you, don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know.\u201d Her mum took a small, etched stone from her dress pocket and clicked her needle against it.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t stick me in a convent, Mum. They\u2019ve done with all that these days,\u201d Cecilia said, eyes on the stone. Beneath her skirt her body quivered. She blew a puff of air through her lips.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a place, girl, remember that.\u201d Her mum traced a tiny pattern out on the smooth grey surface and waved Cecilia from the room. Cecilia glanced back at the stone, shining red in the dank lamplight. Part of her world fell into darkness, the stone the only element of color left.\nAfter Sam came back, shut her up in her room, and locked the door, Cecilia paced for several minutes before stripping and climbing into bed. The sheets scratched her skin. When the house slouched into sleep, she brought her fingers down, curled around her pubic hair, and began to caress her soft flesh. She imagined her mother\u2019s stone as her own, twisting into the shape she dreamed of so often. The sheela with her vulva open. Protector, safe keeper.\nCecilia curved her fingers further, hunting for comfort. She was careful to stay silent, as careful as every night, but the rhythm of her fingers floored her, and a soft moan slipped out. Footsteps creaked outside her door. She ripped her fingers away, pulled the covers over her chest and froze, breath heavy, hot.\nMetal clinked against metal as the key turned and the door opened. Cecilia could make out the stone, glowing red, the engraved figure swaying to and fro as her mum began to speak.\n\u201cHush this child, wash this child, clean thy sins from me.\u201d\n\u201cMum?\u201d Cecilia asked, a hot breeze blowing against her, singeing her skin. Her mum continued chanting.\nThe air boiled against Cecilia\u2019s arms, but she clung to the sheet. When her mother finished the chant, the red stone cast a glow across the room and onto Cecilia.\n\u201cMy girl, you weren\u2019t made for this world. You\u2019ll learn not to show yourself,\u201d were the last words Cecilia heard before her bedroom, the hallway, the red stone, and her mum all disappeared.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nShe couldn\u2019t breathe. She knew what this place was. But thirty years before, it had closed down, and a fire had devoured its insides. Cecilia had walked out here once with mum, when she was seven years old. Purple foxgloves had edged out from the stone walls, creeping through rock. In a recess at the bottom of a hill had sat the burnt out husk of The Good Shepherd Convent. Behind the charred brick, her mum took her to a site \u2014 dug up fresh earth, a mass grave where the Sisters had flung their dead, a burial of women whose names remained unknown. Their wrongs unknown. Sinners, all, mum had said.\n\u201cThe Magdalene Laundries. Those women all won their rewards. I got myself there but Uncle got me out after a few days. Don\u2019t I know they tried to teach me straight. You best be a good girl, Cecilia.\u201d Mum had laughed, dug her fingernails into Cecilia\u2019s palm, and told her to stay out of trouble. But Cecilia hadn\u2019t.\nHer arms shook. She clenched her hand into a fist. Above her, the sky looked the same as any other sky. She pinched herself, then bit her cheek and tasted the metallic tinge of blood. A stab of pain. This couldn\u2019t be. She couldn\u2019t really be in a laundry. Not a magdalene.\nFrom the building a Sister marched toward her. Cecelia swiveled and dashed toward the gate, burrs impaling her bare feet. As she stumbled and fell, the shouts of the nuns closed in. She scrambled up, but by that time, the groundskeeper grabbed and wrestled her back.\n\u201cGet her to the dorms,\u201d a woman said, her voice coarse and heavy. Cecilia fought the groundskeeper, who gripped her so tight she couldn\u2019t breathe. He reeked of old tobacco and rotting leaves. When she couldn\u2019t get free, she squirmed, trying to hide her breasts and genitals, but he\u2019d locked her into place, one rough, dirt-caked hand fastened on her breast, the other squeezing her behind. So it was that every person in the yard saw her nakedness and made their own plans for her flesh.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cWe don\u2019t like it when our daughters turn to the sin of the flesh, Catherine,\u201d the Sister lectured.\n\u201cMy name is Cecilia.\u201d She tried to stand, but the Sister shoved her back into the chair, which nearly toppled backward.\n\u201cYour name is Catherine. You\u2019re in the home of our Lord God and you will obey, if you want to be clean. In our house, you will always wash. Wash until you\u2019re clean, Catherine, and then you might find your way home.\u201d Sister Benedict smiled and then flicked a finger toward Cecilia. \u201cTake her to her bath, Sister Mary,\u201d she said, and another Sister hauled Cecilia away.\nThey turned a hose on her in the shower, the icy water pelting her back, tearing at her flesh. She faced the wall, and when she refused to turn around, someone grabbed her by the arm and forced her. The water skewered her chest and then her vagina, a knifing pain stripping her of any other feeling. When they finished, she dripped dry, shivering.\n\u201cCome along, Catherine,\u201d Sister Mary said. The woman smiled, a twisted, brown-toothed smile, and ran her finger along a black rubber belt she held at her side.\nCecilia stumbled, her hands across her breasts, as the Sister marched her through the smothering halls of the convent. They wound through the laundry rooms, where the other inmates worked. Tubs lined the walls and more were clustered into the middle of a cavernous room, with mounds of linen over half Cecilia\u2019s height. The air burned, the scent of raw flesh hanging.\nWomen, knots of them, all dressed the same in a shapeless brown sack of a dress and a pinafore over it, huddled around the tubs, turning wash cranks, feeding sheets through the presses. Many of them hand scrubbed enormous sheets, and when they stopped, a Sister always stepped up and smashed a rubber belt at the girl. Some of the women wore their hair in tight buns. Others\u2019 hair had been shorn so close to their skulls that razor scars snaked across their scalps.\nCecilia hugged herself tighter. These women all bore that same, long-suffering glazed look. It was not God they sought at all, but death, quick, a cloud of steam that would drown them and remove their torment.\n\u201cYou, fetch this one her uniform,\u201d the Sister barked. A girl no more than fourteen slipped out of the heated room and came back, a pile of brown in her arms. Sister Mary grabbed it and led Cecilia downstairs past walls papered with giant poppies, their petals like wings stuck fluttering in time. They walked into a dormitory of sagging cots. Sister Mary pointed to one near the corner and forced Cecilia to sit.\nThe Sister extracted a long brown strip from the pile and, snapping it between her fingers, walked up to Cecilia, pressed it against her breast and began to wrap it around her chest. The fabric rolled and rolled until Cecilia thought she couldn\u2019t breathe. She wrenched away from the woman and ran, slipping through the cots, banging her shins against metal which clattered against the concrete ground. The Sister dropped the strip and pulled a long rod from her belt, and when Cecilia glanced behind for a window, a door \u2014 any way out \u2014 the nun caught her with a whip of leather that cracked across her face and down her back.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cThere now, get up. There\u2019ll be no more of your nasty bumps,\u201d Mary said, lips curled in a crooked, upside down gash.\nBut Cecilia couldn\u2019t stand without falling onto her knees. Any breath came as a burn, her lungs unable to pull in air without the deep slicing sensation of a razor. When she looked down, her breasts, which had been full and supple, were now flat, insignificant. Her chest ached from the pressure, but when she tried to speak, the Sister slapped her with a belt.\n\u201cOnly one way to leech yourself clean, Catherine.\u201d She threw one of the brown shapeless sacks at Cecilia. Hot pricks of pain swelling behind her eyes, Cecilia pulled the garment over her head, ribs nearly cracking from the effort. It hung heavy, pulling her toward the ground.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cYoung woman, you\u2019ll need to be made of stronger stuff to make it here,\u201d Sister Mary said, and shoved Cecilia back up the stairs, into the laundry room.\n\u201cTime for quiet reflection, Catherine,\u201d she said. \u201cYou clean the linens, you repent of your wrongs. Eyes ahead.\u201d She planted Cecilia at a washtub and told her to work with her hands. The piles of linens closed in, allowing Cecilia only one foot of space. Another woman stood on the other side of the pile from Cecilia, head down. As Cecilia fumbled with the sheets, the water in the basin scalding her, she thought of her mother in the ironing room.\nHer own Mum, spitting her into a place like this. Heat pressed against her face and sweat poured out of her, drenching the binding on her chest, the ugly brown sack, and the pinafore. She reached to pull it off, but the girl next to her hissed.\n\u201cDon\u2019t do it. They\u2019ll put you in the dark room if you do,\u201d she said, her voice a shaky, already breaking string. Heat washed against Cecilia\u2019s face. She thought of her old life, gone now. The way she\u2019d played with the men in the pubs, the way she could pull anyone to her with just a glance. But not here. Never here. The girl next to her was shapeless, like she was, now.\n\u201cLeast it\u2019d get me out of laundry duty.\u201d Her skin puckered up, already blistering in the hot water.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d the girl whispered. \u201cThey\u2019ll lash you, parade you out in your knickers, let the groundskeeper into your room. You don\u2019t know.\u201d\nCecilia returned to scrubbing, her body sticky, unyielding to the heat.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nPerhaps she\u2019d imagined her mum pressing out the wrinkles of some too clean thing, pressing them out forever. That first night she went to sleep believing she\u2019d imagined her mum, believed she\u2019d imagined all of this, that it was only a bad dream.\nBut the next morning she awoke to a windowless dormitory with rows of girls abandoned to God and the chosen flock who performed his commands. They worked Cecilia ten hours a day, six days a week, until her skin crumbled from her hands in long red flakes. The laundry came out nearly white except for spots of red she tried to cover when she passed the sheets along for rinsing. Sometimes she succeeded, and others, she\u2019d receive a lashing.\nEach night the sharp cot springs dug into her shoulders. She longed for her bed, the pubs, the sweet musk of stout on a man\u2019s breath, the raging crowds of hurlers and footballers sloshing their beers over each other. The way she\u2019d sway to the sounds of her people. Despite her discomfort, she felt blood pumping through her genitals again, the first time she\u2019d felt it all day, and though she was tired, she let her fingers linger down toward her vagina.\nHer dressing gown was too long to pull up without anyone noticing, so she played her hand over her garments, letting her pulse build, her fingers pressing. She thought of the ocean surrounding Cork, and the whole wide world beyond that and longed for it all. The pulse and swell of an ocean inside her, the waves cresting, sweeping whole cities up between her thighs. She lifted her pelvis, cot squeaking. Her vagina opened and moaned for the sheela to pull the swells into her, to wrap the world into herself, she the maker, swirling men, forests, the greatest of buildings, all of it into her aching, moaning, wide, wide body.\nHer cot slid and scraped against the floor, and squeaked a little, a little more, and more, growing as she grew, and suddenly a Sister was there, ripping back the sheets and grabbing at Cecilia\u2019s hand and forcing her from the bed and down the hall.\nThey ripped her clothes from her body, their voices calm. Sister Benedict beat her with the black rubber belt, commanding her to recite Hail Marys, but Cecilia couldn\u2019t remember them when the lashes swept across her back, through her nerves, and deep into her bones. The Hail Marys disappeared, replaced by the chant her mum had whispered before sending Cecilia off to this hell. When Sister Benedict cut off all her hair and sliced the razor against her scalp, the only words Cecilia could remember were clean, clean, clean.\nWhat made matters worse were her dreams. The more pain Cecilia felt in waking life, the more vivid the dreams became. The Sheela paraded through them, naked, open to the world, taking in everyone and everything, swallowing Cecilia\u2019s old home and old life and holding them safe for her return. In some of the dreams, Cecilia lay down with the Sheela, and they swelled into each other, until, finally, Cecilia broke free and through the gates, back to her Mum, who would hold her and tell her she was sorry.\nThe Sheela bound itself to her, whispered her secrets into Cecilia\u2019s ear, and Cecilia would wake, tears on her face, hand on her vagina, fingers trying to release her from harm, but she would pull her hand away as soon as she was conscious and dry her face. As long as she didn\u2019t move too rapidly or jerk in her cot, the Sisters wouldn\u2019t drag her from her bed. But still, she stopped masturbating, no matter how much she yearned for that simple touch.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t touch it, I were you,\u201d the girl said, and raised her head. It was her mum. Cecilia balked, but grabbed the stone anyway. She cradled it in her palm. But when she opened it, coldness swept through her. It wasn\u2019t the same stone her mum had used to cast her into this darkness, but her mum had touched it, had breathed life into it. The rock spat a needling stab of ice into her palm.\n\u201cLooking for something else? Told you not to touch it,\u201d her mum shook her head.\n\u201cWhat do you know about what I shouldn\u2019t touch? I\u2019m Catherine.\u201d Cecilia couldn\u2019t let the stone go. Instead, she slid it into her boot, casting around for the Sisters. A few of them stood near, but they hadn\u2019t seen.\nHer Mum shrugged. \u201cDoris,\u201d she said, though Cecilia knew well her name was Edna.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll find that rock,\u201d Mum said, hands digging at the grass.\n\u201cThey find everything,\u201d Cecilia said.\n\u201cNot all. You probably don\u2019t got the brains to slip anything past them. Looks like you like their attention. Shaved head and all. What did you do? Ride some boy out behind church? Pretend you\u2019re a cuttie after someone caught you out?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve only been myself. But my mum didn\u2019t bother to look at who it is I am,\u201d Cecilia said. Inside her boot, the stone cut against her ankle. Gnawing at her skin, trying to hollow her out. An instrument of her mother\u2019s.\nHer mum glared, her smooth skin free of wrinkles, hair free of grey, a honeyed chestnut that would cascade in waves if it wasn\u2019t tied into a taut bun. Still, something hard inside her, burrowing through her insides, trying to cement her organs into stone.\n\u201cShe probably saw you just fine. You don\u2019t get here without a reason.\u201d\nCecilia coughed a hard laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t have room to talk.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t want to ask what her mum had done for her family to abandon her. Part of her wanted to smash her across the nose, but something stopped her. Maybe it was the curl of hair fluttering across Mum\u2019s forehead, or the way her fingers fidgeted with the earth.\n\u201cMy reason is my own. I wanted it. I asked for it. Lot of good it\u2019ll do me. Soon as my uncle found me out, he petitioned to bring me back. They\u2019ll be here tomorrow. Can\u2019t cut twisted sin out this way. Not like they\u2019ll do you. Maybe you\u2019ll have a chance. Me, I\u2019ll be dirty always. Devil got his hooks in too deep.\u201d\n\u201cOnly dirt you got is what they shove all over you.\u201d She stretched her fingers toward her mom\u2019s hand but stopped.\n\u201cI\u2019ll bet you want to believe that. No blame on yourself.\u201d Her mum stood and pointed her finger at Cecilia. \u201cYou put that rock back. You don\u2019t, you\u2019ll see what more sin you bring on yourself. Warning you, girl.\u201d\nCecilia\u2019s throat tightened, like her mum\u2019s touch had stolen her breath. As she stood, the hair on her neck and scalp prickled in the wind.\n\u201cYou\u2019re knackered. What do you know about my sin? I got reasons. I need a way out just like you.\u201d\n\u201cFine. Sleep with that stone for a while and see just how far you go.\u201d She marched away, not bothering to look back. Cecilia trudged back toward the convent, eyes on her mum. The stone banged around in her boot.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nFor days she kept watch for her mum, finally spying her pressing linens. Cecilia trailed behind her back to a second dormitory set near her own.\nOne morning, Cecilia spied her shoving something into a bed in the middle of the damp room. She ducked back and joined the others for breakfast, sweating through her duties for the rest of the day. They led them back to their dormitories after another potato and water dinner, and Cecilia wiggled into a line of girls headed into the other dormitory. Her mum wasn\u2019t there yet. Cecilia looked around, went to the cot, and sat down. It creaked like her own. She lay down, lifted her hand above her head and fished around in the fabric. Girls filed in and one of them kicked at her leg.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t your bunk. Move it before I call Sister Mary.\u201d Cecilia looked at the girl, whose head was shaved and scarred like her own. She sat up and walked toward her own quarters.\nIn her palm, she cradled a second stone, grey, carved with a winding spiral. For the first time in months, something bubbled inside her, lifting her up from the binding of the Sisters and the words they used to trap her.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIf she did make it back, her family\u2019s blood would burn her through. But if she didn\u2019t get out, her insides would collapse. She would wither into threads that would dissolve in the soap and lye of the burning laundries. The stone had to carry her from this place \u2018as soon as she could learn to use it. She would have to wait, to etch herself into it properly, to get the words right. To pull herself back into her time. To pull herself back to her family.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAs she lay on her cot, she reached through the tear and pulled out the two stones. On the one she\u2019d taken from her mum, a black figure flaked red before her. On her own, the figure was almost complete. She scraped her finger against it, filling out the edges, until the etching became her sheela-na-gig. Something in her stomach flip-flopped as she placed the stone on her tongue. It tasted not of dirt, of filth, but clean, of the warm, red wine saltiness of her vagina. She swallowed and heat flowed, an electric charge she\u2019d thought they\u2019d stolen.\nShe rose, walked through the dormitory to the adjoining dining hall with its sagging wooden tables and splintered benches, took up Sister Benedict\u2019s seat, and bashed it through the window. The room seemed to shrink. She gazed out from the broken space onto the still green lawn, barely a breeze rustling the reaching green trees, before walking back into the recesses of the building. Her feet swelled beneath her and smashed through the creaking steps, up the garish poppy staircase toward the laundry.\nThe room spread out before her, silent, a rare cold pressing into her skin. She lifted the dry detergent, shook a little onto her palm, then dropped it to the ground. She grabbed up buckets and poured soap over the tubs, over the floor, dashed it against the wall, and shook out piles of sheets so they\u2019d lay smothered by the detergents. She ripped her dress from her head and tossed it into the mess, then lifted a match she\u2019d snatched from the dining room out of the binding on her breasts, flicked it against her arm and let it loose. As the fire rippled up, Cecilia ripped the binding and her underwear from her body and tossed them into the blaze. Flames rose, reaching for her, but she stepped away, marched out of the building and watched the heat build as waves rose within her body, and she stretched up, up, up into the air.\nThe sheela-na-gig poured through her, burning through her lungs and into her loins. Cecilia grew, her body a mass uncontrolled by the Sisters, the Good Shepherd, her family, her city, her country. Her organs swelled as she reached down and let her hands rove over her body, fully free. Fire licked the top of the convent and Cecilia smiled and blew on the flames to watch them dance. Then she turned her back to the building and marched.\nAs she wrapped her fingers around her mum\u2019s stone, she muttered the words to bring herself back into her own world. A bolt of red shook the sky and then the wind howled her away from the flames, away from the stench of soap and steam. And then before her lay a crumbling ruin, her past dead even as she bled and grew from its lacerations.\nAs the curving, pulsing walls of her vagina sang, she gave birth to the being inside her \u2014 neither woman nor man, not the penitent they hoped she would be. The tidal force of her change swept through the yard, swirling the sins of the Good Shepherd up into her swelling, ever widening cave. The blackened, crushed stone walls that never cleaned and never healed. Swallowed inside. She marched.\nShe was the sheela, and the sheela was she. As she glided naked through the night, her genitals expanded and engulfed the city, a rippling mass that belonged to her. She wrenched Saint Finbarre\u2019s Cathedral up from its roots and pulled it inside her soft flesh. She, the protector, the exhibitionist who offered shelter in exchange for your body. Who destroyed and gave life. Cecilia stretched wider, higher, taking in the River Lee, its lapping waves children of the ocean, the quays, the crowds on the sports fields beating each other without mercy, the fumes of puttering trucks trying to escape, the cracked walls and houses that bent into the hills. The city came into her. An ocean creeping across land, soaking the leftover world with wine, sweet wine of the body, that dripped, without remorse, with faith that the pulse, the urge, the swell of her vagina offered the only salvation.\nAs she swept through Shandon, she rang the bells at Saint Anne\u2019s to let her mother know she was coming.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue25\/3lbe25_story4.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"Gerald Michael Leary flat out fainted when Cecilia Murphy lifted up her skirt and showed him her naked flesh.

The bench was stationed outside the hair salon, and on it I awaited the calling of my name and the simple displeasure of a haircut. The bench was a part of a circle of four benches facing each other and right now one person occupied each bench. We were all trapped. Trapped in the awkward silences that make up most of the world.\nSitting no more than twenty feet apart from each other, our bodies shifted and our eyes darted from place to place, every so often briefly connecting. The woman to my right was bored, as witnessed by her dull eyes and frequent sighs. Next to her sat an empty wheelchair which belonged to her elderly grandmother who was in the salon.\nDirectly in front of me sat a smug, college-age man who, for reasons that escaped me, had his sweat shirt on inside out, the tag jutting out like a growth on his neck whenever he swiveled his head. And directly to my left sat a seemingly pleasant, plain-faced mother waiting for her son to finish his haircut.\nI crossed my legs and leaned back hard against the bench looking ostensibly straight ahead, but my focus was to the left of the college man. I watched an attractive young woman and her even more attractive mother walk into the large clothing store sitting next to the hair salon.\nWe four strangers, connected by stolen glances, were all fighting the same battle of whether to speak or stay silent. We sat back, we sat forward, crossed our legs, shuffled our feet, lay our hands across our laps, then stretched them across the backs of the benches. I could feel the stretched silence form around us into a bubble. Our eyes bounced from one another and then to the fortunate ones outside our cell. College Boy stared at two passing girls, pleading with his eyes for their help. Granddaughter looked anxiously into the hair salon to see if her grandmother was finished yet. Mother stared at me, then the floor, and back to me again until I briefly met her gaze and then the floor regained her focus.\nThe bubble tightened, sealing around us. The strain showed most on the bored woman. Her face was suddenly taut, mouth closed so tightly she seemed to be in pain. Her eyes burst up from the floor, bouncing from College Boy to me, to the mother, and all around the mall. Searching for help, for anyone. Her hands unfolded from her lap, imploring. Her mind flashed out to me. I could hear her voice screaming in desperate wails. \u201cSay something, talk to me, please!\u201d The pressure inside the bubble was too great. I was pinned to my seat like an insect to paraffin. My mouth would not open, half formed words ebbed and flowed in my throat. The woman\u2019s eyes, teary and puffed, looked to the mother for solace, but the mother was already crying on her own, shoulders sagging from the unbearable weight depressed onto us.\nI looked across to see College Boy\u00eds attempts at flagging attention from anyone outside the bubble. But the shoppers passed by him and us, completely unaware of our suffering. If we could only speak to one another.\nMy hands covered my ears, trying to block out the silence as it built to a roar, smooth and raw with power. Thoughts from each of the other three pierced my mind. Bored Woman screamed, \u201cTalk to me!\u201d over and over in a voice weakened by fear. College Boy released a string of expletives, clawing at the bubble with his mind. Mother mewed quietly like a child.\nMy own mind was fighting to open my mouth to speak. I knew now that if just one word was spoken, the bubble would die. But the silence continued to hold us. I couldn\u2019t concentrate with the five voices ricocheting about my brain. Then there were no more words, just a deep bellow. For whatever reason, we turned toward College Boy.\nHis mind melted, streaking out his nostrils in a clear, thick liquid. His body shook out of control, arms and legs flailing. I jerked when his last thought hit my mind. \u201cThe world is mine,\u201d he shouted fiercely, then repeated it in a voice of final plea. \u201cThe world is mine.\u201d\nThe bubble opened behind him, reshaped itself quickly around his body, and ate him. The bench sat empty. I could see beyond it into the clothing store. No one looked our way, no one cocked a head as though they may have heard something. College Boy was gone. The bubble undulated.\nI stopped trying to communicate with Mother and Granddaughter. It took everything I had to keep the silence at bay. It worked at my mind, taking away things I needed. For an instant I couldn\u2019t breathe.\nSuddenly, I couldn\u2019t think of even the simplest thing. My eyes darted all over the mall. I tried to remember where I was. I took a breath and felt again the constriction on my whole body, a giant plastic wrap. The tug of war swept back and forth in my mind until I felt a release of pressure. The silence had shifted its attention to Granddaughter.\nHer body was still, lying rigidly on the seat of the bench. Her feet were being erased. Inch by inch she was disappearing before my eyes. Then I saw the slit in the bubble. Like a zipper being closed, it moved up the length of Granddaughter\u2019s body, taking her away. In desperation I tried again to shout to her. I tried mentally to reach her; but she had closed down.\nBefore Granddaughter had completely disappeared, I turned to Mother. She was doing no better. Still crying softly, her hands were clenched tightly in her lap. Trying to reach out to her, my mind met hers and exchanged thoughts in a jumble of information. I told her to hang on, to keep fighting. I told her the silence wasn\u2019t going to take me. I had always liked being alone, not talking to anyone, thinking through ideas. I knew silence well.\nSlowly I sensed that Mother, too, was going to win her fight. She wasn\u2019t as closed down as I thought. In fact, she wasn\u2019t scared. Though married and mother of a teenage son, she was often alone. She didn\u2019t like the silence, didn\u2019t seek it out, didn\u2019t look forward to it but wore it like an old sweater. She was crying because it was all too familiar.\nWe sat separately, our minds locked together. The bubble tightened its grip. We let go, mother and I. Let the silence in, freed it to spread in our minds. It settled over us, sending tendrils out from the center, feeling for weakness. But I welcomed it, talked to it, lay down in it like a field of wildflowers, stared at it like the stars on a clear night. Mother continued to cry but let the silence in to make itself at home.\nI don\u2019t know how long we sat, eyes closed, on the benches in the middle of the busy shopping mall. Mother gently pressed her hand to mine and I woke from the relaxed coma. She lingered in front of me a moment, already backing away. Before her son and turned with his fresh haircut to see what was the hold up. Softly I said goodbye, and she smiled.\nMy name was probably called soon after, but I was not there to hear it. Instead I left the bench and strolled around the mall. I walked close to groups of people who were conversing and eventually settled at a table in the food court. For once I wanted to be surrounded by voices and noise in all its chaos. For once I wanted to avoid the silence.\n\u2022\n\u00a9 1999 Christopher Hivner, all rights reserved","source":null,"source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/H5-4T+B+G13jWr5U1j3T4BEFHGA.json"}

Duncan","hostname":"3lobedmag.com","date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000","categories":"","tags":"","id":null,"license":null,"comments":null,"text":"0: An Inception;\nThe find was like a bad film\u2019s version of archaeology. She brushed a little dirt aside and found the outline of a door. It even opened for her, like a dream, and so she got to see a little of what waited: shelves carved into stone, bound manuscripts that looked old but not decayed to nothing, a grey stone stairway twisting down.\nHer heart was in her throat and her arm reached out without command. The dusty ruin pulled her, called for her to run her un-gloved fingers over the dusty wall and draw a line across the faded, peeling painting she could just make out in her headlamp\u2019s glow. But she was a good student, conscientious. She called for a professor, and she was bundled out of the way at once, included only at the edges of the photo-ops, though they made sure she was recorded as discoverer; just of the place, not anything inside it. She tried not to be hurt.\nRussian professors led the actual work of exploration, inventory, and preservation of course; Tamara wasn\u2019t even a document specialist, but she would at least get thesis material out of blundering onto a five-hundred-year-old urban legend, and a reputation for luck. There were enough superstitious professors that it would be a real help finding her next job. She reminded herself of that each time the Russian news filled with another smiling face of a professor too popular and too busy to deal with her anymore.\n1. A Calamity Foreseen\nThe second door opens almost like the first, a chink appearing, swinging open, ushering her without resistance into an impossible discovery\u2014but this time she is sure it was not there before she found it. This space of wall was scanned countless times before she returned, it was cleaned spotless, and X-rayed.\nThis time she does not refuse the tugging impulse, the prickling excitement. This time she tastes uncanny in the air and lets herself surrender. She does not think that this will end with lectures over proper technique.\nSo here she is, in a stone well that curves down shallow stairs in a wide spiral. The walls are carved with shelves and cubbyholes that hold books, scrolls, sheafs, or single parchments. The books remain in this archive, and it is clean.\nTamara takes a few steps in, and the walls begin to be painted, full of dark-eyed saints and brightly dressed kings, tenth century imitations of the Byzantine, she guesses. Moving without concern for something so impossible, she reaches for a manuscript. Greek. And another. Is that Arabic?\nIs that her arm? Her clothes are different than they were. Her sleeves are wide and heavy, they feel like vestments designed to slip on over ordinary clothes. The harsh lamp she carried in is a white candle now, burning with the scent of forgotten honey.\nAnother step, and she knows just where she is standing. A different Tamara occupies this flesh with her, explaining, overlaying, almost pushing out the one who entered here so tentative. She recalls the story of these books and walls as any scholar of the second House of Wisdom must. How the wisest scholars\u2014staid ulama and mystical star-questioners of many splendored Baghdad\u2014saw the calamity approaching, collected portents of the bright day when the Tigris would run red with blood and black with murdered ink.\nThey had seen no escape for the white palaces and the great treasures of the caliph, but words can travel light, and they had sent copies and carefully preserved originals on the long journey north and west to the far borders of Kievan Rus, to a place where the petty rulers of the place already kept a little store of old books from the Greek, and here they had begged sanctuary for the memories they carried, delved into the earth and stone for safety from the fire and trampling hooves that might come after.\nTamara walks farther down, and knows without opening them how the calligraphy of these later manuscripts has changed, Cyrillic altering toward the style of the Abbasids. On the walls, icons geometrize. Their eyes are diamonds, their halos single curves of a great tessellation, picked out only by the accent of gold leaf.\nTamara remembers how the second House of Wisdom had become a place of truce, where Christians and Muslims, Jews and Yazidis, and followers of Akbar\u2019s God-religion would meet and share their scholarship in peace, where Sunni and Naziri Hashashin would come and search, the one beside the other, digging old texts for arguments to blast each other down with when they went back home.\nJust as her other is full of self-satisfaction at the value of this place, the scholarly lighthouse to the world, the downward spiral constricts and Tamara\u2019s memory cuts off. It seems a fall of rock must block her way. When she tries to go down, she stops and recoils as if she touched something jagged and stiff, but certainly the walls and ceiling are unbroken when she looks ahead. There is more history unspooling forward, winding down, but she cannot proceed, in body or in memory.\nShe feels attenuated, as if the passage that is wide before her has constricted in her mind to a capillary too tight for air. The her that can be here is growing farther from the her that is. Without that calming overlay, she is claustrophobic, panicking; she returns quickly up the stairs, back to what she was before.\nThe door is not again behind her, as soon as she is out. The memory remains; unspeakable, impossible, and true.\n2. By Faith Alone\nThe her that is here has no reason for upset and steps down unhesitating.\nThis library is whitewashed, unadorned, and here her clothes are shapeless and concealing. The books are unadorned as well, undyed covers with their titles in black. The bindings are of the body and deserve no regard. Only the truths held inside are of the soul and worthy of attention.\nThe manner of the other Tamara here clamps down on her emotion, stilling panic, dulling excitement at discovery. It is correct here to be dour, to be self controlled. If she is of the elect, she will not be frivolous.\nTamara remembers the true history where icons were abolished, and even when the decadent imperial court backslid, Moscow stayed true and had no images, no gold upon the font or colored glass to replace God in simple understanding. Here Christ was poor and without comeliness, and so his church remained.\nShe remembers and swells with joy and faith to think how that virtue made a place of safety and of welcome for the escapees and remnants of dozen heresies purged from the gaudy mother church, for Bogomils and Fraticelli, Cathars, and Lollards, down to Hus himself, who came to Moscow and preached on faith and scripture alone instead of going to be executed at a council of the church.\nShe remembers how some pilgrim had brought poems of that Valentinian the fathers of the church hated above all, and in the debates held above the Moscow library over translation, over the body of Christ, works and faith, marriage and abstinence, the oldest questions of the church, of Christ the God and Jesus the man, of the soul\u2019s God and the cruel demiurge, had been renewed, and in the library of the tsars, any who wished might search in countless copies of the word of God for those secret keys and purifying knowings in the soul that would speed them to heaven and out of the fallen world where their body died.\nIt is not far after Hus\u2019 own texts that the stair narrows too tight for Tamara here, the history escapes her mind, drifts far from the path that could have created her, a child of Soviet defectors born in New York, educated in Philadelphia\u2019s suburbs. She still wants, still wants to fill herself with knowledge of this other past that could have been.\nThe last shelf she can reach swings open, a false door into the bookshop she had meant to visit on the subway. No one seems interested in noticing that she arrived from somewhere strange, and the store has no false bookshelves or revolving walls, of course. She misses the radiance of faith at once; the her that lived there had it in abundance, but ordinary Tamara is sure enough to stop herself from tearing at the walls and shelves that she would only find her way into an institution if she tried too hard for the library.\n3. He Heard a Tale of Alexander\nShe finds the fourth library when her step up turns into down and she stumbles on to a wide stair that could never have been dug under Moscow. The ten-times life size portrait that welcomes her is Peter, greater than he ever was, and where would he have delved but under his great city?\nThe shelves that unfold here are ornate past any limit of taste, adorned with golden laurels, quills, cherubs, and unrolled pages in gilded plaster and pink marble. This is no single helix drilling in the earth. It branches and ramifies, and there are more books than Tamara has ever imagined.\nShe is too overwhelmed by the luxury to be afraid; she is too familiar now with this strange dislocation to be surprised. She goes through the halls like an art lover who has never before heard of a museum, baffled and delighted and hungry for more than she can swallow.\nThere are manuscripts from Rome before it fell, and the work of scholars just inventing science as the library was founded, and barbarously printed single sheets organized by which illicit printing press in Amersterdam or London vomited them out to move the mob.\nThere is a barcode tattooed on her hand, and she feels the tiny and familiar weight of tracking chips in each article of clothing that she wears, and she understands that the furious hunger she has felt is not only her own.\nShe remembers how the world found its course; how Peter, greatest of the tsars, heard tales of Alexandria and how its library held a copy of each book in the world. He had ruled more than Alexander already, how could he be outdone by Alexander\u2019s relic?\nShe remembers how he ordered vaults constructed, and copies made, and every written thing in the world gathered there, and how the knowledge had become wealth, and the wealth power, and the power a hungry need.\nDown these dividing branches are the accounts, the stories compelled out of Cossacks, Kazars, Roma, poor colonized Aleutians, and every people the inquirers could gather and force to spill their secret tales out on the waiting pages of the grand library\u2019s scribes. Here was the heart of an empire built on understanding, built on every stolen secret they could find\nAnd here she walks still pinned beneath its telephoto gaze. She cannot open the steel doors into the modern wings of this unending maze of data, but both Tamaras know what waits behind them, the endless logs of surveillance and biometrics that define the progress of each life under the all-seeing tsars. There are no marks on these doors, but it is not hard to imagine the futile fingernail scratches that mark doors farther in as her excitement curdles into ever-present dread, familiar to the her that lives here.\nWhen up and down agree again with where she was, Tamara is conscious of so many cameras, so many in every room of the library, on every corner of the campus. She never thought of them as sinister before this.\nIt is getting harder to dissociate these waking dreams of places she cannot return to from her ordinary life. They are so fascinating she is never sure she wants to.\n4. A Sunless Century\nHer uncertainty does not stop her fingers tracing the path idly, or keep her eyes from twisting after fingertips to look at one more iteration of familiar stone and shallow winding steps down into darkness. It is thrilling in a way she did not expect to find that she has not lost this secret by leaving the path that led her to it. She has more to escape now, more dullness and disappointment to replace with the wonder of a library unfolding.\nThis version of the library is ordinary, as much as they can be. The first landings are adorned with icons, the shelves filled with old Greek texts copied by Moscow scribes. Some later books follow as she goes deeper, but this library is no grand center of the world.\nTamara is herself here, clothes and hair and bones unaltered, emotion undirected, and as the strange understanding that each archive and its history allows her blooms, she understands why. This history has no place for her, no version she could alter into.\nAs she goes down, the ornamentation of new diggings ends, and the stone is all bare. Tamara remembers how the sky darkened, and they called it the year without a summer.\nLater, they called it the beginning.\nOn the bare walls, paper books give way again to vellum, and those to clay, and those to rough, warmth-grasping passages strewn with bones, broken and sucked for every drop they had. Tamara picks one up and feels the teethmarks with her fingertips to make sure. She drops it with a little hollow sound that whips her like a gunshot.\nThat one cold year had multiplied and darkened beyond imagination as a hundred islands were born in fire and steam and choking smoke, and then America had ended, fire swallowing the West and vomiting smoke so thick the sun was lost for years, and winter did not end.\nFor a time, people had found warm places and tried to live and to remember the bright world, and later they did not. They ate all that was left. And at the end, the darkness under the earth was no blacker than the sunless night under the ruined sky. Tamara is very glad that nothing overlays her here. She can already imagine far too much of the despair the black sky brought.\nThere is no part of this branch Tamara cannot explore, and none she wants to linger in, and she is hungry as she climbs back to her sunlit life.\n5. A Branch Below the Root\nOne look into the shell and her wholeness is pulled into the twist and black of it and she is in the library.\nShe knows this place but it is nothing like the place she knew before. These walls are white and cut in flowing shapes like the caress of waves. They shimmer nacreous. There are no books or pages to be seen, but on the floor in front of her, Tamara sees a something: a bone to begin with. It might have been a pelvis, but now it is a mad string diagram of interlocking helices that twist through curves and intersections that do not seem to meet the demands of regular geometry.\nTamara touches it and understands. It is unlike remembering. It fascinates her, exhilarating beyond measure, but the feeling is distant; the bone is touching her at the same level of metabolism she uses for emotion, crossing her own signals as she is informed.\nThis is a map of the maze she has been walking through for seven years without a wall to follow. Understanding of this place that she has seen only a corner of intrudes into her mind, flowing up nerves as she feels the strands and branches of the scrimshawed bone. This is how time branches, and an infinitesimal fraction of its branches have this spiraling archive of the Moscow tsars as a pivot point important enough to be found through its turnings.\nOnly so much she can describe in words, because she has been trying for years to understand her own experience with a mind that thinks in words. A mind so not-like the one that made this map, this place, this world.\nTamara can wrap no words around the things that fill the slowly digging spiral in this place of knowledge made by a people whose mothers\u2019 grandest mothers never learned to speak, who must think mind-to-mind, by shape instead of tripping tongue.\nTamara is changing toward them now. Here she is as here is, like the bone-builders, clever fingered, un-tongued, unbothered by the bird-twit words that try to pin the world artlessly. She feels how that speechless sculptor came here from the makingplace, tastes where her ego is stitched to one time and one space and how to sever it.\nShe does not return to somewhere she departed this time. She can find the doors to every iteration now, and her finger-bones know how to open them.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue33\/3lbe33_story3.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"Tamara found the lost library of the Moscow tsars by luck or destiny.

The slurping of marrow, the fluid dripping from her jaws, the varied noise of her digestion. The bitch\u2019s snout was buried in disinterred remains. Albert froze, no longer struggling, seeking to delay the moment he came to her attention.\nThat silk could bind so tight.\nA charnel house in the familiar church yard. The stench of decomposition and the dripping remnants took him back to the Western Front. Only his eyes moved, darting from horror to horror. What was happening?\nThe thing was globular in the moonlight. Heavy breasted. Round haunches curving to a woman\u2019s thighs that soon became dog\u2019s legs.\nOr a jackal\u2019s.\nHe tried to control his shivering in the warm night. She would turn and see him. Otherwise, why would they have tied him and left him here?\n2.\nSoaked. The stained grains on the surface would blow away, to be lost amongst billions of others. But the gallons that soaked through, blood wending its way like water through gravel, heading for a parched destination.\nRoss recognized the shallowness of what he had once thought had been at his core, his desire for the exotic. When faced with the truly foreign, he had run, and was still fleeing, leaving names and identities behind like confetti floating on the wind.\nAfterward, his overwhelming sense had been of clockwork, a mechanical tableau played out. Instead of brass, the mechanism was rock, driven by energies greater than the forces of desert winds and scorching sky. When the images returned late at night, they stretched beyond the cave, gears turning the ancient rocks of the planets and asteroids as they spun in slowly decaying orbits around the sun.\n3.\nHis captor evaded the bare foot easily, snaring it in silk and tying it to the post. \u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? Will you shoot me?\u201d\nThe man shook his head. It was covered, the head garb trailing down over his shoulder. Not a turban, but Albert did not know the word for it.\n\u201cIf you try,\u201d the man began, producing a serrated dagger from the folds of his robe, \u201cI will cut you.\u201d Matter of fact. \u201cNot tie you. Slice through the tendon above one heel. Maybe both. It will be a long time to heal. You will never walk easily again.\u201d\n\u201cI am to live through this?\u201d\nThe man sought the right words. \u201cThis is the appropriate attitude to bring to the endeavour. Fatalism creates the wrong atmosphere.\u201d\nBeneath the afternoon sun, Albert was chilled.\n4.\nAwake, unbitten and unsavaged. Eyes adjusted in the murk, wondering where he was. He marvelled that he had slept. The ground shook and the rumbling echoed in the hollow of his chest. He knew why he had woken.\nOceans the size of a duchy persisted below Arabia. Ancient water remained from the sea that had left behind the mollusc shells he had seen on rock exposed after centuries beneath dunes. His imagination preferred a massive watery expanse with subterranean storms and huge eternally dark waves, though he knew the sea was trapped within shale and stone like oil. Even so, rivers travelled where rock had failed and pressure had forced the water out, and he guessed the rumble was the stream that fed the sheltered pond that had drawn him here.\nRoss (though it would be many years and several other identities before he adopted that name) shuffled along, further away from the entrance. A strange quirk of the local quartz, or chance angling of the rock recess enabled him to see where he was going, despite the entrance being lost from view. The happenstance of a breach in the rock continued downwards, an easy slope leading him on hands and knees where he otherwise would not have bothered going. A litter of stone fragments disguised that the turning floor was smooth. If it had been outside, it would have been a helter skelter, a ha\u2019penny to slide. The burrowing of a great worm exuding acidic slime from its maws as it moved beneath everything. Now, there is an image for Dr. Freud, he thought. Which way did the worm come? Magma forcing its way up, or water wearing its way down?\nHe followed the path further and further down.\n5.\nThey were in the church yard. Surely someone would see. Someone would walk through in the next instant.\n\u201cIs this a joke? This is very serious, what you are doing.\u201d Careful enunciation, so the little foreigner could understand him. He didn\u2019t know where the other one was.\n\u201cOf course it is not a joke. To take and tie up a policeman like this. We would want to have a very good reason to do such a thing.\u201d\n6.\nHow far he was from that cave. Now he breathed in steam and coal dust, not dry desert air, and brushed soot from his serge sleeve, not ash from a thoab. Ross rapped the bench. reading railway station said the sign, and all is right with the world. He brought his knuckles to his mouth, and sucked unwittingly at the fresh cut from this morning.\nThe steak knife had slit through the side of his finger as he\u2019d hacked at his orange, leaving a pouting lip. A scimitar of blood arose, and awareness returned. Ross had surveyed the mess, his search for clues in the archaeology of his breakfast.\nSteam billowed about him, the engine chugging out clouds as the train was readied. All that had passed between then and now. How difficult to return from the war and live what was thought to be a life. Empires had fallen, and here he was, catching trains instead of blowing them up. Sitting on benches instead of crouching behind dunes. Bearing an umbrella instead of a rifle. All will be well, and all manner of things will be well, he recited. Then he glanced at his wristwatch. The face of it squirmed and made no sense, and his stomach sank.\nThe fog that obscured the station around him could not have poured from the steam engine. The humdrum world was gone, the busy people lost to him. The set was struck and the stage stood bare.\nA new cave presented itself, bored through the fog, clouds hiding the sharp edges that would cut through and tear at him. In the distance, a smile bearing the promise of pain. Heisenberg was right, though the professor could offer him no practical assistance. Ross had observed, and in observing had become part of the equation. Now he suffered the unforeseeable consequence of disturbing a mechanism worn delicate.\nThe tunnel telescoped. The distant image resolved. Slim, barely female, the colour of tea with a brief splash of milk. Observed, its spring sprung, the androgyne began to stroll towards him.\nBefore he was lost, Ross acted. He ignored the tendrils of steam, the infinitude of confusion that led to world after possible world. All the men he could have been, all the fates he may yet suffer. One foot in front of the other, just the way his mother had taught young Ned all those years ago. Avoiding the sick-making suggestion that Reading Railway Station was less than real, he strode the distance to the carriage from memory, stepping it out yard after yard, not looking to see whether his feet were hitting the platform, or sinking several inches into it. His own machine drove him on, its clockwork as hidden as that of the orange. He walked, he climbed, he stepped up, he grabbed. There was a lurch, and whether it was the train or the world that shifted, he did not know. He froze, eyes scrunched and head bowed, as though waiting for a sandstorm to pass.\nSolidity ebbed back. The carriage floor grew firm. Ross opened his eyes. The world had returned. The train clattered over a bridge, and he looked down at the Thames.\nHe had left his satchel behind on the platform. The price he paid to flee this time was only his manuscript, a year\u2019s work.\n7.\nThen he was taken from behind. His despair that he was taken so easily, that he was held and could do nothing.\nThey stripped him and his heart galloped. His shame would be exposed, he could not live if it was, could not bear it, but they had left him his drawers. He stood, near naked, while they were robed. Like Bedouin or such, he guessed. Some Arabian Nights affair. Not that he could know for sure, his war had been entirely on the Western Front. When had they changed their clothes?\nHe worried that they would leave him alone here, until someone came upon him. Then he worried that they wouldn\u2019t, and some poor soul would be caught up in whatever nonsense was taking place.\nWhere were the villagers?\n8.\nThere was no geological purity here. Igneous rocks penetrated sedimentary. Great spans of years wore all of it down. The tunnel grew a little, the descent ceased. A sleeve of shale had fallen away, sharding the floor, exposing granite beneath.\nThe roof moved. He thought his vision blurred, then that some creature was above him, or a breeze was blowing ... something. Then he realized. Through the wound in the shale, he saw the source of the earth\u2019s vibration. Ancient rock slowly dragging itself through a mostly hidden expanse. A wheel not quite the same darkness as the roof, bearing markings he could make out but not understand, despite his education.\nIt was close enough that he could have touched the wheel, let the eons drag across his fingertips as it circumscribed its way through rock. Eyes closed, he concentrated on the noise. In the distance, a similar sound, of higher pitch, joined it. Another wheel?\nAnd finally, his attention complete, underneath it all, from just next to his head, he heard a moan.\nHe jumped, of course. Barely there, it emanated from the rippled wall. His eyes were playing tricks, searching for meaning that was not there, like astronomers seeing canals on Mars. It was an illusion of a fossil, a vague resemblance to a visage reduced almost to nothing by deep time.\nWith the merest disturbance of dust, the story failed, as a lid lifted and a rock eye stared out at him.\nNow that he could see one, they were everywhere. Not some bas relief. A foot protruding from rock here. An outline of a torso. Things in the earth that had become exposed.\nHe touched nothing. He went no further. Slowly, then quickly, he retraced his steps, the corkscrew of the tunnel more obvious in his faster ascent. Behind him, a new sound, a whisper. He was sick, as though something obscene had been exposed, and he would not remain here a moment longer.\nHe had climbed down, of course he could climb up. It was an illusion that the tunnel seemed to have narrowed. It was very, very old, and could not change in a few minutes. Only fear suggested the pinprick of light was vanishing. The entrance would still be there, he would not be trapped. Still, he hurried, dragged himself up, leaving skin on stones, a small price to pay. Scurrying, fleeing, and as he reached the entrance to the cavern, the bare trace in the earth, he burst out, breath exploding from him as though he had been underwater for minutes. He exalted in the open space about him. The hottest hours had passed. He wasted no time leaving.\nBehind him, below him, infinitesimally, heads turned. He had observed. In turn, he had been observed.\n9.\nEnough really was enough. Unbidden, a decision formed. He could hold out until mid-autumn. Why bother with another winter\u2019s gloom? A mild day, before it became too bleak. Streaks of cirrus against a still blue sky, the hint of frost to come, crunch of straw beneath his feet. A last look at the turning leaves. He would stumble. Bad leg, you know. War wound. A simple hunting accident, not uncommon at all, even for one adept at handling arms. He could almost pity the farmer who would find him, but after what he had seen, not really.\n10.\n11.\nWhen the twilight dwindled away, it left a blackness penetrated only by stars. He could have been floating in space, and despite the persistent warmth, he shivered at the thought. Then, fooling him (because he thought it was not due for at least a week, and he was not wrong), the full moon rose.\nHe blinked, and when he did something shifted, and in the lunar luminescence, he saw through another\u2019s eyes.\nAlbert gasped. His body sagged. Everything had been a dream, these past twenty years an illusion. He was awake now, and back on the Somme.\nA butcher\u2019s field. A desolation. Bodies buried after earlier onslaughts, disinterred by explosions, their parts scattered and draped, a landscape furnished by the eviscerated. The earth a churned quagmire, the soil a sponge that if pressed, evicted blood. It was over, he had not survived it, he had died and haunted the battlefield, his apparent life the daydream of a wraith. Where was his corpse? Was it the one being fed on over in the corner?\nWhat was that?\n12.\nSufficient to each night are the worries thereof. Days were for the work of hands, and he rubbed them together. This morning was for him and his motorbike.\nThe grumbling beneath, the solidity of road pressing up against the rolling wheels, the security he cherished and loathed. A fraud as much as always, walking about in a borrowed persona, hiding in the world. Ned, T.E., Chapman, Shaw, Ross: all the men he had been. Pick a name, any will do.\nVibrations coursing through him, sun warming, fields alive with green, exhilaration tempts him. A crass approximation of joy stabs his heart, the magic of a summer\u2019s day. He would prefer a world with no magic at all, straightforward Newtonian physics, with cause always preceding effect.\nWhat does a hint of happiness precede? Rounding a bend, she is there, the sudden scorpion spoiling an English attempt at paradise. Surprised, he swerves to miss her but she has already vanished. Her winding path has spiralled outwards, and he has intersected it again.\nShe appears outlined against storm cloud, a foul sky that was not there a moment before, but has always been here, at this place and time. This is how she is for him. Slim, boyish hips. High cheek bones, semitic nose. The promise of everything, wanted or not.\nIt is not cloud. It is darkness pressing through. The wind is not blowing a storm, it is air fleeing the breach of reality, streaking from huge fingers that unfurl and part the sky. At night, he has been constructing a poem to convey it, using images that a mind evolved to survive on an African plain can understand. Formlessness beyond creation. He chooses not to look up. What sense would his mind make of it? Would he picture a distant eye staring down, a djinn peering at a world trapped in a bottle?\nHe is a man. He can make choices. He will not be part of this. He will have no truck with things of the air. Any accidental transgression has been paid for time and again. The blood that has been spilled, the lives lost, the causes betrayed.\nShe is there. The sacrificial slaughter of the battlefield has kept the door open. Is blood required to close it?\nHe will have none of it. He waits. This too will pass. Meanwhile, he sits astride his bike, booted feet firmly planted on bitumen. He is not stupid. He has studied the lore, taken precautions. Lodestone, inscriptions, herbs, incantation. He is not bound.\nAround the corner, puffing as though they ascend the latest turn of a long corkscrew, come two boys on flimsy bicycles. They swerve all over the place. They are oblivious to the androgyne and the torn veil. They know nothing of the howling winds that would bear their small forms away in an instant. They lean into the corner as they turn on the ascent. He is stabbed through at the sight.\nHer smile is canine. Her face is hunger. She is not composed of atoms. If she could be held, if she could be dissected, there would be no space in her but the gut demanding to be filled. She is Freud\u2019s onion, the same all the way through, no mystery to be revealed, only appetite.\nHer shape is that of a curse.\nChoose.\n13.\nShe flowed, a quivering mirage of soil and night, not bound by the complexities of human locomotion. She poured towards him, and for Albert she was milky in the moonlight, and round, oh so round, not like the pinch faced city lasses of recent years. Observing, he determines her for the moment, fixes her shape with his pointless desire. Though he does not want them to, his eyes travel down the marble whiteness of her, the smoothness of the curved belly, and he yearns despite himself, despite his wound, pulls at his bonds while his mind reels, knowing what has gone into that mouth to fill that stomach.\nWhile he pulls, she marvels at the gift that has been presented, and turns to look at the human skull she holds, as though to share the moment with a companion. Albert can see that the skull has been gnawed. He presumes it has been dug from the grave she was worrying at. Her raking nails protrude through the eye holes, and he wonders if he is staring at his own remains, if he is a ghost haunting a battlefield.\nAn animal, he decides, a night creature thrown up by evolution, filling some monstrous niche in the food chain. She surprises him though when she breaks the silence, throwing his theory of a mindless beast into disarray.\n\u201cSon of Eve,\u201d and of course the \u2018s\u2019 is sibilant, dragging on, longer in his mind than on the air. Her face is human. She touches him, and he sees the stain of muck on her fingers as they approach his face, readies himself for the nails to penetrate his skin. He imagines the fingers at play, worrying beneath the flap of his scalp. \u201cAl Bert\u201d, she says, picking his name somehow from the aether, and he shivers at the connection she has made between them. She smiles again, as though at some tremendous play of words, and the slaughterhouse stench rolls out with her breath. She will flow about him and he will be lost. She is made of teeth, every part of her a mouth, he will be consumed, he thinks, when he hears another voice.\n\u201cGhoul.\u201d A simple declaration, a cataloguing statement made from somewhere to his left. She is fast, very fast, and Albert sees seized in her other hand not the skull but the small Arab, her worshipper, the one who left him as sacrifice to this thing.\nThis close to her, he sees the fresh blood on her face, and the thought comes; there are no new dead here. Not in this yard. What rawness has she been eating, that it could still drip fresh down her chin? Time was not right, things were out of joint. The little Arab does not look happy, her fingers are through his robes. Albert sees the black seep at his shoulder and knows it is moon lit blood.\n\u201cSons of Eve,\u201d snake drawn out, \u201cI have you both,\u201d and triumph was there, pleasure at a victory achieved. Though the victory was beyond Albert\u2019s comprehension, there was also a hunger, which Albert understood very well. Her head rose, taking on again a wolfish cast. Her eyes lifted to the impossible moon, glowing green.\nReaching low, her nails scratched at Albert\u2019s groin, dragging across his scar. Momentary confusion, expecting one thing but finding another. She reacts, and it is then that Albert sees a tiny star streak across the yard, a light broken away from the litter of the others in the heavens. She moves, but not quickly enough. She leaps, but the orbit of the star bears into her, tearing into the flesh above her breasts. The meat of her splits and there is a hiss of escape. Only as she falls does Albert hear the bang.\nThe small Arab was down. Despite his wound, he was cutting, hacking at her neck. Albert heard the crack of her skull as her severed head was flung against a tombstone. The man chopped, breaking off her limbs, throwing each to a different corner of the field. There were words of course, a constant muttered litany, but they meant nothing to Albert.\nWith only the torso left, the Arab dug with the point of the knife, the same point that had been in Albert\u2019s mouth just hours before. Albert felt a sympathetic twinge in his cheek. Wiping away gore, the man held up the treasure he had retrieved. As he did, his companion walked across the yard towards them, bearing a long rifle.\n\u201cSee,\u201d said the small man, as though Albert was a fellow enthusiast being shown an interesting specimen. \u201cMeteor iron. Struck down by iron from beyond the earth.\u201d He smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t want to lose that.\u201d Then the knife came toward Albert.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he cried, leaning away, but they held him firm. They cut the silk and caught him, bearing his weight gently.\n\u201cWe owed it to him,\u201d said the small one, speaking English for Albert\u2019s benefit, but the other shook his head, and Albert realized they were speaking not about him, but of another.\n\u201cWe did not, but in honour we could not leave him like this.\u201d\nThe grass was a soft meadow, no sign of the viscera that had littered it moments before. Albert\u2019s naked feet were no longer in danger from splintered bone. \u201cIt is dead,\u201d he said, but it was a question.\n\u201cWhatever \u2018dead\u2019 means to a thing of that order,\u201d the small man shrugged. \u201cIt will feed on him no more.\u201d\nThey bore Albert up before a grave. The moonlight gone, they shone a lamp at the inscription.\nto the dear memory of\nT. E. LAWRENCE\nThis was where he had first seen the creature, but now the grave was undisturbed. Nothing monstrous had dug its way out to emerge from its larder. A vase of marigolds rested there. All still, all quiet.\nAn oppressive weight was lifted from him. Other than the ache in his limbs, all Albert felt was a sense of liberty.\nHe straightened and looked at the Arabs. \u201cWhat happens now?\u201d\nThe taller man turned and walked off, shouldering the rifle. Looking back, he said, \u201cNow? It is up to you.\u201d\nAlbert had been a wind-up toy, borne here on the inevitable track of his one life. Now he was derailed. Possibilities stretched before him, definitions beyond the gelded policeman. Not every path led to that autumn morning in a frosty field.\n14.\nRoss wheels the bike away, gunning the accelerator, as though he flees, as though he has not all these years and many miles been following the path set for him. As though he could not have been plucked from the air or dragged down through sand or vanished from a railway station.\nThe world is distorted at the edges by goggles. It does not bother him. There is the wind in his hair and the rumbling machine beneath him, and in that moment, it is enough. What is a curse, what is fate, other than an inability to jump from one track to another? He has travelled more than enough tracks for any man. All the men he has been.\nThe blackness above him is unobscured by the order we have imposed, no longer papered over with the legends and habits from which we have cobbled together the mundane. It is a place beyond creation and rationality, a place of its own senseless causality, a wilderness of pain and evil refreshment. It is a long night with the Turks.\nFaster faster, Ross accelerates until he reaches the rock that marks the edge of the road, and he is up, he is flying, he has found the path that has no surrounding. He climbs the invisible road. The bike roars and he is tearing, he is rending the air, climbing the wall of it, boring through. The hole in the sky takes human shape, and she \u2014 it \u2014 descends.\nHe leaps his last track. He meets it in the air.\nThe boys hear the noise. There is a flurry. They see the man catapult, turn through the air, a stunted flight without wings. They say it was over in a moment.\nThey did not hear the screams. They did not see his face, torn between terror and desire.\nThey cannot know that the moment stretched more than a thousand years.\nEnough time for the granting of all wishes, known or hidden, consistent or not. The price he paid. The careful filleting that can occur over such a long time, the precise slicing required to lay a delicate mechanism bare.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue25\/3lbe25_story3.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"His shame was exposed, the scar where a shell splinter had torn through his groin and ripped away his manhood.

You\u2019ve forgotten many things, but you remember that. You\u2019d befriended a stray calico, a ragged, skinny thing with a milky eye and gimpy foreleg. You\u2019d fed it greasy breakfast scraps every morning one summer until it fattened, until the summer mornings gave way to September\u2014and your quiet little corner of the world breathed first-frost\u2014and everything withered, as it does, and the stray stopped coming. You\u2019d sat on the gray wooden porch for a full week, with a half-plate of eggs or bacon; or a bowl of milk sweetened from sugared clusters of cereal; sat until the maples dropped their dead leaves, and the wind took them away, as it always does. You were dead, too, as withered as the world. Father shrugged.\nWe all disappear eventually.\nAnd then he did. As we all do. As we all will.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nReif would like a cat, you\u2019re sure. He\u2019s at that age. Without a father, a cat is at least some companionship other than just you. And a cat is more dependable than a father. But with the rations and cost it isn\u2019t feasible to own one. Those who had pets simply abandoned them. You can see the strays on the streets below if you raise the window blinds. They slink along like specters in a world the color of dry clay. Sometimes, if you glance up, you see a hard winter sun, like a tarnished nickel, in a putty sky.\nToday you can hear the government-sanctioned delivery truck below. You lift the blind a few inches, peer down. It\u2019s the refrigerated unit\u2014the national grid has only been back up for a short time\u2014so you may get some meat and cheese. Eggs if you\u2019re lucky. Medicine if luckier. You see the workers unloading the palettes while the guards stand by, vigilant, their steely-black weapons up and ready.\nYou pull the blind halfway, let in some meagre alkaline light. An inky shape in the sky catches your attention, a bird, dark and silent, gliding and disappearing into the gray mist as we all do, as we all will.\nReif is at the small kitchen table, head slightly bent, fists propping his chin, brow furrowed, peering at a book. A history lesson today. His hair is unruly, uncut, barbed and wiry like his father\u2019s. His father. Disappeared\u2014like your father, like a lot of fathers\u2014long before any of this. Before Reif, even. Sometimes, in a dark part of your mind, you think he never existed, that you made him up.\nYou tell Reif about the delivery. He closes his book, fits his mask snugly and goes to the door to wait, even though it\u2019ll be some time before they reach your floor with the allotment. Delivery day is exciting, and he\u2019s always eager to see what we might get. Perhaps there will be soda crackers, and peanut butter. His favorite.\nYou grab last week\u2019s empty totes, then affix your mask and join Reif. Soon, you can hear the delivery persons moving down the hall, knocking on doors. Reif looks up, eyes round and bright like glassy marbles. Not like the long-ago milky-eyed stray. The government allowance means you can stay home. You don\u2019t miss the office. You miss the people. If it weren\u2019t for Reif, you\u2019d be so very lonely. You try to hug him, but he ducks under your outstretched arms and sprints away.\nA sudden knock and you jump. From habit, you peer through the peephole though it is occluded and long past any usefulness. A dim figure on the other side. You unbolt the chain, pull the door halfway open. An arm reaches in, snatches the empty totes and pushes in two full totes. Just two. It was supposed to be two totes per person. Another falsehood. You\u2019ve sent the forms. You\u2019ve followed up. Nothing. Perhaps next delivery.\nReif digs in the totes, pulls out the crackers, skips into the kitchen. He\u2019s your one salvation\u2014a small stone of hope rolling down a mountain, gaining momentum.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cHello,\u201d you say, in a voice unused to speaking.\n\u201cHello,\u201d you hear, and open the door a crack. It\u2019s a woman.\n\u201cI\u2019m across the hall,\u201d says the woman, gesturing over her shoulder. No mask. Her expression inscrutable, eyes bright and round and greeny-copper like old pennies. There\u2019s a noise coming from her apartment, something or someone moving about.\n\u201cYes?\u201d you say, tentative, looking through the crack.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the woman says, \u201cdo you own a screwdriver? The one with the \u2026 I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s called. The X. Or the cross.\u201d\nA screwdriver? You think there\u2019s one in the kitchen drawer, nestled under the spatulas and peelers and rolling pins. \u201cYes. I think so.\u201d\nThe woman smiles, all good cheer, and clasps her hands in front of her. No gloves, either. \u201cCould I borrow it? Please? We\u2019re assembling things today.\u201d\n\u201cJust a moment,\u201d you say, and close the door. You turn to ask Reif to fetch the screwdriver, but he\u2019s gone, so you retrieve it from the clutter of dingy cutlery and bring it to the woman. \u201cHere,\u201d you say, pushing it through the small space you\u2019ve made between door and frame.\nThe woman smiles or grimaces, it\u2019s hard to tell, and plucks the tool from your hand. Her fingers brush yours. \u201cThank you,\u201d she says. \u201cI must have misplaced ours during the move. I\u2019ll return it.\u201d\nYou nod, but realize she probably can\u2019t tell, so you pull the door wider, lean forward. \u201cOkay.\u201d You nod again. \u201cOkay.\u201d And she turns and slips back into her apartment, and as the door opens there\u2019s the brief sound of conversation, as if the television is on. And you briefly envy her.\nIn the kitchen you carefully wash and sanitize your hands. Reif enters and you tousle his wiry curls. His hair is getting long. It grows so fast. You both smile. He pulls the crackers and peanut butter from the cupboard and settles at the small table.\nThe dining room is dark, night leaking into the room like an oil spill. You sit, switch on the small lamp to chase away the darkness. The night will swallow you if you let it.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHe\u2019s on the screen now, interacting with the other students, in their virtual world. And it often feels unreal, like living a digital, spectral life, and you worry for him more. But when he\u2019s done, after he\u2019s eaten his lunch of crackers and broth at the small table, and he\u2019s in his room completing his assigned work, or disappearing into a book, all is quiet, and it\u2019s like he\u2019s not even here.\nAnother knock at the door shakes you from your reverie. You glance up and Reif is gone, the screen black and dead. Disappeared.\nA faint murmur from the hallway. \u201cHello?\u201d\nYou move to the door, mask on, peer through the peephole, sigh, slide the door open on its chain, peek through the crack. It\u2019s the same woman from yesterday. The neighbor. A small smile stitched on her face. You unbolt the chain. The door swings open, creaking on a rusty hinge. You inch forward, a foot on the threshold and it feels like a victory of sorts.\n\u201cI\u2019m your neighbor,\u201d she says, a pale hand gesturing, \u201cfrom across the way.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d More murmurs from her apartment, the door wedged partway open.\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry to be a bother,\u201d she says.\nAgain, you think. A bother again.\n\u201cDo you have scissors?\u201d she asks.\nOf course, you think. Who doesn\u2019t own scissors?\n\u201cYes,\u201d you say. \u201cI do.\u201d\nAn awkward shuffle of her feet, a pained expression. \u201cCould I borrow them? I can\u2019t find mine.\u201d More shuffling. \u201cI\u2019m cutting hair. I\u2019ll wash and return them as soon as I\u2019m done. Promise.\u201d\nBriefly, remembering the screwdriver, you entertain the notion of telling her No. But you relent. \u201cSure,\u201d you say, \u201cI\u2019ll get them.\u201d\nYou turn from the door. Reif is unseen. It\u2019s a wonder how he can disappear in such a small apartment. The scissors aren\u2019t in the kitchen, so you move to the bathroom. Somewhere, a door creaks. Yours, you think. You should have closed it. You find the scissors in the medicine cabinet and return to the front door. Did it swing open more? You look past the woman. Is her door open more? A dark blur of shadow passes in the sliver of light.\n\u201cHere,\u201d you say, handing over the scissors.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\nYou quickly close the door, the unbolted chain swinging like a pendulum timepiece tick, tick. A swirl of gray in your head, a sudden fog. You close your eyes, lean back against the door.\nBreathe. You\u2019re so very tired. This world makes you tired. You stumble toward the bedroom, pull off your mask, fall into the still unmade sheets. Close your eyes. Breathe.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThat strange halfway state, caught in the foggy veil of dreaming and the cusp of consciousness, almost aware that it\u2019s only dream as you struggle to wake in the swirling gray aether, your heart an overwound timepiece, your mind whispering none of this is real, only dream, only trance; it\u2019s not your mother moving down the hallway to your childhood bedroom, carrying a dead cat, to tell you that father is gone\u2026\n\u2026none of this is real\u2026\n\u2026outside your door now, cradling the limp cat in the crook of one arm, raising her free hand to the door to\u2026\nKnock knock! Knock!\nYou stir, blink your eyes open. Gray light spills into the room. You rub your eyes until they squeak. Just a dream, you think. A nightmare.\nKnock knock! Knock knock!\nThe door. Someone is at the door.\nYou roll off the bed and pad to the front door. You\u2019re still wearing yesterday\u2019s clothes. You wonder what time it is. You\u2019re disoriented. You wonder why the apartment is so quiet. You wonder\u2026\nKnock. \u201cAre you there?\u201d\nYou move to look through the peephole but remember it\u2019s useless. You turn to grab your mask from the key-hook but it isn\u2019t there, and you dimly recall shedding it in the bedroom. Reaching up you\u2019re surprised to see the chain unbolted, hanging lifelessly. You blink but the world is still a grim pageant of grays.\nPulling open the door you see a strange woman standing in the hall. She\u2019s holding her arms out, trying to hand you something. Her door is open, and a figure stands in the wedge of hazy light pouring from her apartment.\n\u201cOh, dear,\u201d the woman says. \u201cAre you okay? You look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m \u2026 tired.\u201d You look down at the woman\u2019s hands, at the screwdriver. The scissors.\n\u201cI washed them,\u201d the woman says. Smiling, she looks back at the figure in her doorway. \u201cHe needed a cut. It was getting a bit wild. It grows so fast.\u201d\nYou take a small step forward, one foot on the threshold, and peer around the woman at the boy, his curls freshly shorn, his eyes like marbles.\nThe woman pushes the implements into your hands. You grasp them to your chest.\n\u201cThey grow up so fast,\u201d says the woman. \u201cDon\u2019t they? Even in these strange times. Before you know it, he\u2019ll be gone.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d you mumble. \u201cYes.\u201d You take a step back.\n\u201cAnd if you need any help, just ask.\u201d A plastic half-smile from the woman. \u201cYou can borrow him any time.\u201d\n\u201cI will,\u201d you say, closing and locking the door, and turning back to your small and quiet world.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue36\/3lbe36_story4.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"We all disappear eventually.

The overhead lights are already dim. Everything\u2019s gossamer here, paper lanterns on exposed bulbs to minimize the glare, all the harshness in the world scrubbed away. Shadow is best for the things that live in your belly. Keeps them calm. Not that calm matters for long. If this one is like the others before, it\u2019ll flap its wings, sloughing off your blood like bolts of lace before taking flight into the world. Chances are you\u2019ll never meet it. Chances are it doesn\u2019t want to meet you.\nInside her gold-plated cage, Matilda spins a melody, the crystalline rhythm of her voice a fervent welcome for the new addition. A bluebird, Matilda was the fourth, and after she escaped your body, you captured her in the kitchen and clipped her wings. That\u2019s the only way anything stays with you \u2014 if you shackle it to your side.\nSirens wail in the distance and you wonder what the candy-coated surprise in your viscera will be this round. A dove, a crow, a canary \u2014 you can\u2019t decide as the crescent beak slices through you, and sinuous trails of red map your skin. It\u2019s happening faster than usual, which means you might have to perform the delivery yourself. Something rises in your throat and catches there. You double over and gag a feather into cupped hands. Glistening in your palm, the plumage is pure sapphire, possibly from another bluebird. You hope so. Matilda\u2019s birth was the easiest so far. One twinge and it was over.\nBut a new kind of pain, sharp with metallic edges, sears through you, and you know beyond reason this one\u2019s not a bluebird. It\u2019s something else. Your back arched like an anxious cat on a back alley fencepost, you writhe, and mincing your skin, the bird emerges, one puzzle piece after another. Two speckled eyes, a blue throat, one red wing, one black wing.\nWhen it\u2019s free, the creature stands on your frayed body, its mottled feathers ruffled with bits of flesh. The colors, the shape are like no bird you\u2019ve seen. With eyes like tiger marbles, it turns and examines your face as if it recognizes you, as if it alone knows who you are.\nYour heartbeat quickens like the flicker of first love. You want to run. Your body\u2019s too weak to run. So you close your eyes, and the world fades away.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cBoy or girl?\u201d the party guests asked that day, their flushed cheeks and plastered smiles bearing down on you.\n\u201cI want to keep it a surprise,\u201d you said, but you wished someone would ask you why, so you could tell them of your superstitions\u2014the ones your mother passed on to you, the only inheritance she left behind\u2014and how those superstitions made you certain something was wrong. You never went to the doctor, not for an ultrasound or even a routine checkup, because you knew they\u2019d confirm what you feared.\nBut your friends didn\u2019t ask. You hid in front of them, hid in the open, and they never noticed. Maybe you were always invisible to them, a faded specter among the living, and this was just the first you realized it.\nSo you drank the pink punch so sweet your teeth ached and you opened the foil-wrapped gifts and you thanked everyone for coming. It was what you were supposed to do. Pretending was the only way you could keep yourself from screaming, crying, begging them to set you free from a life no longer your own.\nYour husband tried to make it easier. As a third trimester surprise, he bought you a cottage in the country, a slice of once-verdant land in the middle of a brown forest. Or what was left of a forest. Most of the trees had withered and died, a disease having swept through years ago, but the place possessed a decayed sort of elegance, the frail branches stretched taut overhead like a corps of ballet dancers preparing before a performance.\nThe sky gleaming indigo, your husband smiled and carried you over the threshold as though you were newlyweds. For weeks, everything indeed felt brand-new and shiny like the intricate treasures a magpie collects to construct a nest for its young.\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d you said, a bloated Baba Yaga who didn\u2019t need to eat children for them to end up in your stomach.\nBut the world soon lost its luster. You didn\u2019t realize it at first, only saw faint hints of it brimming around the edges of your life. It was in the way your husband\u2019s gaze darted away from you and your roundness waddling down the hallway and into the kitchen. You weren\u2019t shaping up like a soon-to-be mother should. The proportions were all wrong, and there were other things too. Like in lieu of pickles and ice cream, you craved seeds. Sunflower, flax, pepitas\u2014it didn\u2019t matter. Seeds were all you wanted.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d your husband asked.\nYou confessed your fears to him. He laughed and pulled you into his chest.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be a wonderful mother.\u201d\nThough it was summer and the heat hung in the air like thick billows of chiffon, your skin bristled, and you shivered against him, his luminous skin scented with sweet aftershave and the musk of expensive cologne.\n\u201cBut everybody tells pregnant women they\u2019ll make great mothers,\u201d you said. \u201cIt can\u2019t always be true.\u201d\nAnother laugh. \u201cYou\u2019ll make it true.\u201d\nBut still he wouldn\u2019t look at your belly. After awhile, you wouldn\u2019t look either, not when something rippled beneath the surface or when your morning sickness yielded bits of down instead of stomach acid. You couldn\u2019t confide in your husband again. He was the one who wanted the child, and because he was too good for you, his broad-shouldered body and bright-eyed face the envy of everyone who glimpsed him, you feared another confession would be enough to undo the tenuous matrimonial thread that bound you together. He was all things, and you with your hand-me-down dresses and hair like wilted straw were nothing. But he claimed he loved you anyway, and you wanted to believe it, wanted to give him a child to make sure his love never came unknotted.\nThe labor wasn\u2019t like the Lamaze class said it would be. In the living room beneath lights not yet dimmed, you collapsed to your knees and, and through lips cracked and dried, you called out for your husband, but he was buried in an upstairs room far from you, and your voice was too slight to retrieve him.\nA scream no more than a whisper, and your stomach tore in two. Where there should have been placenta there were tattered muscles and something else escaping. A child. Your child. Eyes bleary, all you saw was a flash of snow-white feathers and then darkness.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nYou murmur your husband\u2019s name but earn no reply. Nothing can salvage him for you now.\nFrom above you, Matilda caws in her cage, and you remember. This is the twelfth birth, and something went wrong. Or went right. Lately, you can\u2019t tell one from the other.\nThe men in white are here, and they crowd closer to you as their medical needles stitch your ragdoll body back together. There\u2019s glass on the floor. Even though you left the door open, they must have broken a window anyhow and climbed through to reach you. Thanks to their haphazard entrance, the cloth diaper cake is in ruins. The last remnant of who you were, crumbled into dust like a beheaded Greek statue.\nYou search the ceiling and walls for the creature that fled your body. \u201cWhere did it go?\u201d you ask, struggling to stay conscious.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, ma\u2019am,\u201d the men say. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d\nYou try to tell them they have no business taking care of anything except your cleaved stomach, but they never listen to what you say. They take a broom from your closet and beat feathers from the plaster. Matilda screams as though she too can feel the pain.\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d you whisper, but the words dissolve on your lips like a pillar of salt in the sea.\nSomething thuds to the floor, and you cover your face with both hands. If only Matilda could break free from her cage and pluck out your eyes. Then you couldn\u2019t see what they did to your baby.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cHopefully, it\u2019s someplace faraway now,\u201d he said.\nBut every morning, as you swept the cottage porch, your gaze remained with the sky.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d your husband said. \u201cIt was just a fluke.\u201d\nBut you knew better. The bird was a piece of you. It came from somewhere inside, and when your husband set it free, you lost part of yourself to the firmament.\nEveryone pretended they didn\u2019t blame you, but it was lies. His golden skin cold to you, your husband refused to lie in your bed, but even without his touch, your stomach swelled again. There was no revelry held in your honor this time. No friends or family dared to come near you.\nThe only ones brave enough to breach your body were the men in white coats. They X-rayed your belly and pointed to the hollow shape that resided not in your womb but in your guts.\n\u201cIt would be an outpatient procedure,\u201d your husband said on the way home from the doctors\u2019 office. \u201cA few snips and gone.\u201d\nYou shrugged and said you\u2019d think about it. He told you he loved you and wanted what was best for you. But you knew it wasn\u2019t true. He couldn\u2019t love you, not if he didn\u2019t love all of you.\nHe could, however, love another, love her well enough to plant a child with no feathers inside her. Because he was good at make-believe chivalry, he stayed with you to witness the second form rip through your body. A cardinal, its claret feathers matched to the afterbirth that stained your skin. As the paramedics patched you up again, your husband chased the bird out a window, and from the floor of the cottage, you watched through the glass as the shape departed, a single drop against a vast navy sky.\n\u201cI hope it found the first one,\u201d you said.\nOutside, the exposed trees wilted in the wind.\nAfter the paramedics left, your husband stood in the living room, suitcases quivering in his hands. \u201cYou keep the cottage,\u201d he said and took everything else.\nLater that spring, you read the birth announcement in the local paper. As if to torment you one last time, he named his daughter Ava.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cWe need to take you to the hospital,\u201d they say. \u201cThey\u2019ll suture you better than we can.\u201d\nYou shake your head. Your body heals faster than it should. Maybe it\u2019s the scar tissue built up and toughened from a dozen births, or maybe the birds lick you clean before they leave, a parting thank you to the woman who gave them life. Either way, you have no need for a doctor.\nMatilda sobs in her cage, but only you can hear her tears. The other creature lies lifeless at your feet.\nThe men motion to its corpse. \u201cDo you want us to dispose of it?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d you say, \u201cit\u2019s my responsibility.\u201d\nAfter their hushed sirens depart the driveway, you look to Matilda, and she looks to you, and together you whistle a melody at once familiar and arcane, mournful notes that have lived inside you both and waited for the right moment to escape.\nUpon hearing the song, the creature thrashes its black and red wings before lurching to its feet.\nYou smile and beckon it to your side. It listens to your commands.\nIt listens though you never speak.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cMa\u2019am, we\u2019re here on behalf of the state.\u201d\nYou told them to leave. They didn\u2019t listen.\n\u201cYour condition is a potential public health hazard.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Like I\u2019m contagious?\u201d You scowled and fidgeted in the doorway.\nThey examined you through wire-framed glasses and eyes rimmed with red. \u201cWe have to look into that possibility,\u201d they said. \u201cIt will just be a few tests.\u201d\nYou didn\u2019t argue. Arguing with men in suits never worked out well for girls like you. They\u2019d pin you down with paperweights and wait for you to surrender. It was easier to acquiesce.\nSo they took you to a hospital and stuck you with needles until your stomach bubbled like caramel on a burner and the next child arrived. It was the only birth not at home and the only one you regretted. The men caught the creature with a dark net and without so much as a nod toward you, they exited the delivery room. As the door swung behind them, a wing flapped helplessly inside the nylon cage, and you caught a glimpse of a feather \u2014 a perfect gloss of black silk.\nOne month later, in a neat brown package, the men sent you the ashes along with a one-page printout of the results.\nnormal crow specimen. no abnormalities detected.\nYou cried unabated for weeks. All the births had stolen something from you \u2014 your friends, your husband, your peace\u2014 but every time before, you comforted yourself that the tiny speck had soared to the sky, toward places you\u2019d never see. The sentimental keepsake was yours, but the government men stole that away too. Now even your grotesque parts belonged to someone else.\nOn your nightstand in the box they sent you, the gray dust shuddered beneath the glow of a paper lantern. It was all you had left, and though the men gave it to the incinerator after they\u2019d poked and prodded and gutted it, they couldn\u2019t annihilate it. Not completely. One dark fleck of feather remained in the corner, a holdout the flames could not touch.\nAs a kiss goodbye, you pressed the quill to your lips, but the nothing fragment vanished into the air as though it was never there at all.\nBut it was there. You remembered how that lonely black wing flailed against the net. And because it was part of you, you were there too, hidden away in ash. You were there, and never again would you let them take what was yours.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMatilda waits too. You open her cage, and she hops on your shoulder.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d you say to her, and she leans closer and hums you an elegy you\u2019ve never heard before.\nSmiling, you open the door, and the twelfth bird takes flight.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThat necklace dangled over your heart the day you started a class on bird watching at the local community college. If you were destined to birth different species, you should at least be able to identify them. Beneath flickering fluorescent lights, the other students in the class stared and whispered to each other. They knew who you were \u2014 a walking freak show in a faded linen dress. But it didn\u2019t bother you. At a desk with a popup top, you took notes and whistled a songbird tune. Sometimes, the bird in your belly joined in, and she had a beautiful voice, and the duets terrified the others more than anything you could croon on your own, as though the townspeople genuinely believed wings might sprout through your flesh and your mouth might transform to a razor beak that could tear them into bits. This made you smile. As she stirred in your stomach, you learned to love this bird, the fourth one, even though her feathers had a penchant for catching in the back of your throat.\nShe was born while you dozed one afternoon, the pang of her birth melted into your dreams of falling, always falling. When you woke, you found her in the kitchen, perched on an empty wooden canister labeled plain sugar. Thanks to what the class instructor taught you about clipping wings, you tethered her to you and named her Matilda for no reason except that it suited her. She looked like a Matilda. Her birth was so easy you cobbled yourself together again with a sewing needle and a spool of cotton thread.\nBut you weren\u2019t so lucky after that. The next seven births fragmented your body, blood and muscle and intestines like pink tinsel painting the cottage floors. You loathed the paramedics and their glares and their disgust at the tricks you, a strange circus animal, performed, but you needed them if you wanted any chance of surviving.\nIt became a maddening routine. As you sprawled in a fountain of your own fluids, the paramedics found a broom or a flyswatter and beat your children from the walls. It always injured you anew to see the birds broken before you, even though once the men were gone, you and Matilda would coax the creatures back to you with little songs that revived their trodden bodies. Over and over, you opened the door and tried to follow them, but they always escaped you, delving deeper into the forest where the darkness and the unknown lingered.\nBut as with all patterns, it couldn\u2019t last forever. Like a change in the weather, you and Matilda could feel it in your hollow bones. The bird you\u2019d always wanted was coming. The one that could set you free.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe sun dips down to the tops of the tree trunks, and with your mended stomach in spasms, you suddenly fear you\u2019ll lose sight of the twelfth bird in the gloom. But nestled on your shoulder, Matilda murmurs in your ear and tells you to keep going. Because you trust her, you listen to what she says.\nJust before night sets in, you reach a clearing. There, they wait for you, their beaks pecking at the ground, exhuming grubs. Doves and crows, cardinals and bluebirds, dozens of them, far more than you\u2019ve given to the world, more birds than you could have birthed in an entire lifetime. Still, they know you. They\u2019re all parts of you, the splintered mosaic of your heart that nobody, not your friends or your husband, ever wanted to see.\n\u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d you say, and they chirp and chatter in reply.\nWhen the birds have their fill of worms and dirt, they float into the air. They\u2019re ghosts like you, creatures of this world and not of this world at the same time. And they\u2019re beautiful. Swaying against you, Matilda nuzzles your cheek as if to say goodbye. Her feathers no longer clipped, she takes flight and joins the others. They circle above you, strung together like pearls on French wire, and you wish you possessed wings so you might yoke yourself to them.\nYou purse your lips and whistle, a call only they can decipher. They hear your wish, and one after another, return to earth to claim you. But they don\u2019t take to the soil. Instead, they open your mouth and force their way down your throat and into your belly, back to the place from which they came. Gagging, you swallow the feathers and the beaks and the talons that rake the insides of your cheeks into ribbons. You taste blood, your blood and theirs, and you taste something else too. Each bird has a different flavor, all of them sweet perfection that melts in your mouth like spun sugar. Rock candy for the doves. Cinnamon discs for the cardinals. Gumdrops for Matilda.\nWhen the sky is empty and the sweetness ebbs away, there\u2019s one thing left for you to do, and you know what it is. You open the locket that hangs from your neck and gulp down the dust. Not a trace of honey there. It smacks of antiseptics and chloroform, an acrid tang that blisters your tongue. The agony the third one felt under needles and microscopes becomes your agony now, and you\u2019re grateful to share the burden.\nUnited at last, your children stir in your belly. It\u2019s their home, and in a way, it\u2019s your home too. The desiccated branches shift and contort overhead, and all around you, the forest is convulsing to life.\nThrough scarred skin, you hear Matilda sing a melody as the birds flap their wings in unison. Any pain they once inflicted inside you is gone, replaced with pure bliss, something far beyond what your husband or the government men or the townspeople could ever understand. This sense of calm like childhood dreams come to fruition is yours and yours alone. You tip your head back to the sky, and the birds carry you there. Together, you soar above the cottage, above the town, above the people who look up and no longer whisper but scream until their throats are raw.\nFor the first time, you are whole, and the world whirs to life in celebration.\nBelow you, the trees are all in bloom.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue27\/3lbe27_story6.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"A yellow beak, the shape of a crescent moon, pricks through your abdomen, and you know it's time.

Surely she\u2019d recognize the girl, the shape of her existence, the weight of her presence \u2014 even if the child no longer resembled the daughter Mariska had borne.\nHer search took her from city to dorpie, the tiny towns littered along desolate roads separated by scrubland dotted with pink-white cosmos flowers. She searched the faces of the flowers; she searched the wind and the space between the stars. She thought she caught a glimpse of her daughter in the knotted branches of a buffalo thorn. But the leaves rippled and contorted.\nThat was not the face of the daughter she\u2019d woven in flesh through song and sigil.\nSomewhere nearby, a string twanged. The sound was a hook, catching between Mariska\u2019s ribs and reeling her through the wreckage of the dorp.\nEventually she found it. The piano teetered in a corner. Its lid sagged beneath the weight of crumbled bricks. Mariska stumbled through the rubble of broken glass; stools turned to kindling and tables reduced to toothpicks. Her steps disturbed the jackals gnawing on a carcass crushed by falling concrete. They fled on silent paws, black backs streaking through the landscape of gray.\nShe drew closer to the piano and Mariska\u2019s fingers twitched. Melodies tangled in her mind. Choked by dust, they died at the back of her throat, never making it through her blistered lips. Once, it had been so easy \u2014 the power tangible and always within reach.\nBut after the world skidded sideways into silence, music and magic flitted beyond her grasp.\nDesperate, she\u2019d tried to draw from the rainbow-scummed puddles of magic decaying in ditches beside the road. The sigils she\u2019d traced in the air hung limp and impotent. The magic was no longer hers to command. It belonged to the veld now, burnished blood and fire by the setting sun, dry grass blades rustling a symphony to the twilight, joined by a chorus of hyena laughter splitting the darkness with a cackling glissando.\nThat night, she thought she\u2019d heard a girl\u2019s voice \u2014 her daughter\u2019s giggles echoed in hyena voices. But the night was its own music, its own magic. Wild and evasive.\nMariska missed the music of the familiar, of calm and content, of a mother bouncing her child on her knee, of little fingers caught in hair, of tears turning to smiles with raspberry kisses. Of sigils and spells, and a tomorrow that didn\u2019t attack with venom-fangs and razor talons.\nShe missed\u2026\nThe piano twanged again, another string succumbing to tension. Something twanged within Mariska, a sinew-gristle snapping in her chest as she limped and lurched toward the instrument.\nIts right front leg was splintered. Dust and ash clung to the lacquered wood. She traced a treble clef in the battered lid, then five lines and four sharps. Perhaps she was there, between the semi-tones. Her daughter\u2019s memory scratched inside her skull, baby nails carving messy triplets into her thoughts. Mariska drew the notes across the stave.\nA song of shadow and moonlight, of loss and hope and the void between.\nAn acrid gust blasted through the wound that had once been a wall and her stave vanished. Mariska\u2019s eyes burned and blood dribbled from her nose. The wind carried bitter magic belched from the rifts that had torn apart her world. She felt its teeth tear into her insides, chewing on the soft parts of herself not yet hardened to grief.\nBracing her hip against the piano, Mariska dug her fingers beneath the lid. She pried it open, ignoring the splinters catching beneath her nails.\nTears washed grit from her lashes as she stroked gentle fingers across the mostly intact keys. Every shuddering note made her gasp and ache.\nThe piano sang with a broken voice as she moved down the octaves. The notes were out of tune. She searched for her daughter in the dissonance and caught sight of little curls twining around her fingers and her heart, cinching tighter, tighter, until she couldn\u2019t breathe for fear she\u2019d exhale her child gone for good.\nBut the dissonance faded and so did the suffocating band around her chest.\nGrunting with the effort, Mariska dragged a chunk of debris toward the piano, then sat. She was too low, elbows and wrists at odd angles. It didn\u2019t matter.\nGritting her teeth, she forced her leg into place on the pedal. Slowly she lowered her foot, biting down on the scream as agony tore up her calf and zipped white fire through her thigh. She swapped feet. It didn\u2019t matter.\nMariska slammed her palms against black and white, pumping her left foot against the pedal. She conjured a storm and sent the chromatic hurricane hurtling through the city.\nThe ruins surrounding her quivered and sighed; a dead heart juddering with weak pulses. Here, an artery of power still simmered beneath the cracked skin of the earth. A ley line trembling, pure and waiting to be tapped.\nDust billowed in motes whisked up by Mariska\u2019s disjunct melody. Brick and mortar shivered, returning the music in ever softening resounds. The dorp relayed the notes in bouncing beats from windows to doors to pockmarked walls as it woke from its silence.\nMariska continued to play, her fists unfurling to shape chords with long fingers. Her left hand coaxed harmony from the injured piano while her right wrung melodies from battered keys. Her tears splashed the keys in perfect counterpoint, a contrapuntal spell reaching through grit and ash, and deep, deeper into the earth\u2019s blood clotted with magic beneath her feet.\nFurther away, the city\u2019s wreckage stirred. A figure emerged, forged from a shifting thrum, all peal and echo.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nC-sharp is the color of grief. Mariska\u2019s, and his own. Entrained to her beat, he sees her in another time.\nHe sees the child in her arms and hears their laughter.\nHe feels the chasm widen between them, fingers grasping in the darkness, long before the earth split.\nAnd on that night, he hears their cries, an augmented fourth of pain and rage and disbelief as arcane seams stitched into tectonic plates shift against the threads. Sutures snap and the ground gives way, swallowing mountains and cities, and a child reaching for his mother.\nTwenty-three days ago, his mother wailed and wept. Ignoring her crushed leg, she reached over the precipice, searching the void. Above her, magic danced in skeins of purple and green across the face of the moon. Blinded by tears and blood, she crawled lento toward the precipice, calling out a name.\nC-sharp tries to remember his name, his real one. He tries to remember what he was before he became a shrapnel scatter. He feels himself stretched thin and littered in forgotten places. He is hyena breath and the dust frenzy-whipped in the veld. He is cosmos petals limned in dew, a web spun in a dark corner, and the impossible distance between line and space on his mother\u2019s stave.\nHe can never be who she thought he was.\nHe hears a name, the dead one, spelled out by her fingers.\nHe gathers the music in invisible hands, the notes quicksilver as he grasps for self.\nBut the melody changes and he splits in two, shifting to B-minor. She peels out of him, a slow coagulation of buzzing atoms. He takes B-minor\u2019s hand, their fingers sliding together in flawless fit.\nTheir echoes curdle the air, minims and crotchets and a rare semi-quaver sweeping in relentless four-four toward a perfect end.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDevelopment\nShe woke to a rumbling, a gentle prelude then sudden crescendo as the bones of the world dislocated. She ran and the ground lurched beneath her feet. The ceiling collapsed. She fell and couldn\u2019t get up. Instead, she crawled.\n\u201cMamma, mamma!\u201d her daughter\u2019s screams drove nails through Mariska\u2019s chest.\nShe was too late. The building tore in two, the other half crumpling like paper as it sheered away, taking her daughter with it.\nThe city writhed in bombastic death throes, a frisson of violent magic.\nMariska barely remembers what came after, only that she searched, joined by ash-stained others. Together they ripped their hands raw on the wreckage. They coughed and cried. They shook fists at the indifferent sky, at the taunting chasms opened at their feet.\nThe earth hemorrhaged magic, its veins sliced open. Human hands couldn\u2019t staunch the flow. There was no tourniquet large enough to fit a noose around the world, nor the hearts of those sobbing in the ruins.\nMariska found nothing but disappointment.\nShe staggered away from the city, passed convoys with their Hekse promising spells of renewal. She\u2019d endured their mumbled magic, their sigils burning her skin. The scars were promises \u2014 promises of reshaping a world flung from the potter\u2019s wheel.\nThe scars were lies. There was nothing left of her daughter except the memories Mariska carried inside her head. But even those couldn\u2019t be trusted. The herniated ley lines still leaked their slow pollution, warping, twisting, unmaking all she\u2019d known.\nMariska wandered, aimless, trying to escape what she had undeservedly become.\nSurvivor.\nBetween then and now, there were swaths of shredded skin, blood and blisters, hunger and thirst, stretches of nothing nothing nothing but the gray-black sky curdled by vulture wings. And there was hope, deceptive and cruel, worse than the lies singed into her skin.\nAt the piano, tears cooled on Mariska\u2019s cheeks as she played. Another string broke. The pedal stuck. Her finger tripped over a note. The melody warped and changed.\nAnd between the notes, she felt it. The face of her daughter appeared in her mind, rendering in familiar shapes and contours, but it was wrong \u2014 different from how she wanted to remember; different from the song she\u2019d threaded through her belly sculpting tiny hands and feet.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nC-sharp shudders: a ripple through the echoes, a rise and fall of sweeping melody. New themes crawl and scramble from the ash at his feet. Diminished, double-sharp, they swarm like butterflies around a corpse.\nB-minor smiles in gentle harmony, her presence a consonant relief.\nHand-in-hand, they wade toward the piano. The source of the thrum, calling out and pulling them in.\nThe notes smell of Mother, of home and unconditional love \u2014 but that\u2019s wrong, different from the true memory fluttering in the liminal space between selves.\nThey can see her now, hunched at the keys. She trembles, her leg weeping, body oozing sweat and shame.\nHe feels the memories pricking against his shiver-skin. C-sharp gathers the echoes with a cadenza sweep of his phantom arms. They mesh, a tapestry of sound knitting the delicate fabric of his body. His shimmer-spine grows rigid, eyes shaped like semi-breves and his mouth a softly curving slur.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nRecapitulation\nBut first, she would finish the music. She would bring her world to a proper end.\nHer daughter was gone. She knew it now, the taste of the truth bitter as old blood, a scab between her teeth torn from the wound in her heart. She would never be able to apologize. All she had now was jagged-edged regret.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nC-sharp minor picks his way across the floor. His feet are heavier, his movements slower. The thrum between his atoms soften as, finally, he reaches the piano.\nHe knows this song. A memory flutters free from the cage of static in his mind. His body trills with the flash of imagery, of long fingers on a keyboard, of his own smaller ones pressed over them.\nMamma, he whispers in his phantom voice. The word flays flesh from bones as he remembers\u2026 playing together, they conjured magic and music. Moonlight danced across the piano, the world turned polished silver. He remembers how she cradled him and nuzzled mother\u2019s love into his ear.\nBut that was before. Before his song modulated to a different key. The same melody only an octave lower, settling into perfect harmony with the chords he\u2019d always known in his heart \u2014 notes so different from the ones his mother had chosen to spell the name of the daughter she\u2019d never had.\nNow, he rests ephemeral hands on his mamma\u2019s shoulders. He kisses her hair and her tear-damp cheek. He laces his fingers over hers, shaping new chords and weaving the melody to spell his true name.\nNote for note, he sifts through hot skin and sinew, through muscle and organ, to rest in the wet soul of his mother\u2019s bones.\nHe diminishes, a minor death.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe susurrus turns to silence.\nShe breathes the caustic air, trying to fill the hollow spaces within her. The emptiness cleaving through her insides still vibrates with subtle pulsing.\nMariska presses her hand to her chest. She feels the throbbing of her heart. And something else. Beneath it \u2014 a ghost-flutter against her palm.\nShe listens, catching the faint reverberation. A snatch of song\u2026\nShe never had a daughter. She knows that now. All this time, she\u2019d been searching for something she thought she\u2019d lost when he\u2019d been there all along.\nShe hears it, a growl and rumble. She feels it through her feet, an approaching thunder.\nSurvivor, she thinks, this time with less shame.\nWithin her she carries his memory, his truth and his name. It\u2019s etched into her bone.\nThe word echoes between her ears in a boy\u2019s voice filled with hope.\nMariska stumbles from the piano.\nIn the distance, the convoy churns across the horizon and the power of the Hekse part the acid sky. Their sigils dance on the wind, drawing on the artery of magic beneath her.\nMariska waves as she staggers, onward\u2026 onward, her steps lighter now.\nShe shouts. She sings her son\u2019s name. And the city walls echo her love, a chorus in C-sharp minor.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue32\/3lbe32_story2.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"It's been twenty-three days since she lost her daughter.

I\u2019ve heard she was born with teeth, too, and while that would have suited Sunchoke, regrettably, it is only a rumor. She was never interested in the mossy art of being soft, of letting herself be coddled. When she strode through the forest, branches moved out of her way. When she swung on sinewy arms, they bent to catch her. She knotted twigs so their shadows spelled rude words in the dappled light. I scrambled after her on my bruised-apple ass, whining when I couldn\u2019t keep up.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault your feet find roots to trip over,\u201d she\u2019d say and toss pinecones at my head.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault you\u2019re convinced you\u2019re something special,\u201d I\u2019d answer.\nShe\u2019d shrug, and if I was lucky, she\u2019d hold back the blackberry vines instead of letting them fly in my face.\nMy sister was heir to the forest throne, born to lead the wild things. She did not want the offerings they sent: hollowed-out burls and hummingbird nests. The keening skull of a blue jay. The yellow wing of a finch twitching in the sun. They never would have parted with such prizes for anyone else, and she reveled in their fear, crashing heavy boughs down on them whenever she pleased, all the while chewing mushrooms and licking tree frogs.\n\u201cWhat would I do with those?\u201d She passed the gifts on to me as big sisters do with that which they would not be caught dead, and I, I treasured them. But I soon tired of spying on her and scavenging for love in her castoffs. I built a secret throne high in a crumbling cypress. Then I stole her title for myself.\nI love my sister. But she never understood what it was like to grow up under a shadow that howled like a night-hearted sprite.\nI took the finch\u2019s golden plumes and made a crown, with its bones, a necklace adorned with the screaming beak of the blue jay. With cobwebs, I crafted the inscription that would have anointed my sister Queen of the Canopy. But I did not draw it on her forehead as I was meant to do, no.\nI snuck up on her while she was napping \u2014 was it cowardice or cunning? \u2014 and fixed the cobweb glittering with power to her calloused foot. I pricked her with a bramble, tricking her into kicking me as big sisters are prone to do. Her heel thrust the inscription onto my cheek, and thus, I crowned myself.\nSeeing the magic I wore and reading my treachery, she reached for me, for my silver-smeared bruise. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d\nThe wind came for her then. It had observed her with apprehension, Sunchoke being its one competitor who could sway the trees. And if there is anyone filled with more jealousy than me it is the wind, jealous, of course, of violence it has not itself committed.\nThe wind stole my sister so quickly from my side that even now my hair lashes toward the cloud where she is kept. With spider silk still clinging to her foot, and feet that were adept at kicking, she kicked and kicked and wove the silk into a great parachute the precise shade of rain.\nThe lightning will hold her awhile, but the thunder is already too afraid to groan. The clouds, like the branches, cowards, part for her. The wind is embarrassed it underestimated her and keeps her aloft, surrounded by storm.\nShe glides above us, east, west, searching for me. Her hair flies about in long, undone kite-tails, electrocuted. She calls my name, and the wind, defeated, always finds my ear. I watch her seduce the lightning strikes from where I hide in the densest, swampiest weeds, far from my throne. I war with the wild things who jeer at me, calling for my head. Hollering up at my sister to come for me, to take me up. To take me down.\n\u2022\nFront & Back cover art by Rew X\n\u2022\nJulie Ireland\nBear Weiter\nKelly L.\nJessica Guptill\nThomas Ha\nMaria Haskins\nLorna D.

It was a star that\u2019s never been there before and then it just happened out there and none of the people on TV knew how. It\u2019s a bright star and they said it\u2019s getting closer real fast and the astronomer scientists say it\u2019s impossible and shouldn\u2019t be there. I\u2019ve seen that star before.\nGuess what else, diary. Today was my anniversary. I have been the Elevator Inspector Union Member Number Four Four Eight for thirty-seven years today. I am also state certified in escalators, dumbwaiters and industrial lifts. They gave me a coupon worth fifty dollars for it at the department store where I bought trousers. When you\u2019ve been there for forty years they give you something gold. I already got a pin and a plaque and a certificate and other things. Only Oscar Phelps has been there in our chapter for longer than me and they gave him a new suit. He\u2019s been in it for six more years than me but he\u2019ll be dead by March. On a Friday. And then I\u2019ll be there the longest.\nWell, Diary, I\u2019m going to hit the hay.\nYour friend,\nAbe Melfin\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI\u2019ve never told you before, but I\u2019m a very good Elevator Inspector. I have performance reviews and I pass with flying colors each and every time. I know about torques and manifolds and viscosity and counterweights like nobodies business. Why, just four years ago, do you remember, diary? We saw that thing on the news where a cable got sheared over in Plattesville in the Standifer Building and an elevator fell six stories. And there was people inside of it. Three people and one was a seventeen-year-old boy. They said that his life was full of promise and that it was tragically cut short in his prime. They said that. They were all mashed into glue with their bones sticking out. They were just a puddle. All three of them. They did an inquiry and it turned out that it was all because some dip put a wheel on wrong.\nI was working on a big old Skokie Freight Model Thirty over at Methodist Hospital today, diary. I was feeling up the wire and I thought, if I wanted to, I could fiddle with some bolts. I could get out my pry bar and make the cable go all wobbly. I know how. And it wouldn\u2019t happen for months, diary. It\u2019d take its time. But when I did, that car would crash so loud they d hear it over in China. Everybody in it would be made into soup and turn their spines into talcum and pop their skulls like balloons. They would be so full of promise and cut off in their prime. I could do that, diary. I know the way. If you knew what I knew, diary, you\u2019d never take the elevator again. Believe me. You\u2019d take the stairs.\nWell, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\nAbe Melfin\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI went to the doctor again today and he doesn\u2019t know beans. He says there\u2019s nothing wrong with me at all. He is a liar. I tell him I got headmoulde and the purples and he says he doesn\u2019t know what those are. And him a doctor who\u2019s been to school for years and years. He says I\u2019m healthy as anything and I should see a psychotherapist. I think he should be impaled.\nI liked it when you would go and the doctors would tell you you got quinsy and ague and St. Anthony\u2019s Fire and the French Pox. Those were the doctors I liked. And they had those little lances and they\u2019d open a vein and bleed you till you couldn\u2019t see no more. Those were some doctors who knew their stuff.\nThis doctor says I\u2019m fine and dandy and that I just keep coming to the doctor for no reason because I like it. I tell him I got the rickets real bad and he should open me up and poke around inside. He gives me little white pills but they re just sugar. I haven\u2019t had a good bleeding in forever.\nAlso this doctor is always wanting me to take my underpants off which I don\u2019t like because I don\u2019t have anything down there where my legs come together. But I never do. I tell him I\u2019m shy.\nAnd I am shy.\nBye bye,\nAbe Melfin\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nNothing to report today. Hope you are the same.\nSincerely,\nAbe Melfin\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nGuess what?\nI saw somebody today. It was Roger Buntzweiler. I was inspecting those elevators in the Federal Building near the bus station. Those are those big fifteen-ton American Hydraulic jobs. And who should be there but Roger Buntzweiler? And he saw me and he said, \u201cHassarquiel! Why you old so-and-so! How the heck are you?\u201d And I said, \u201cMelenchiel. That\u2019s you. How are you?\u201d It turns out he works in the Road Commision Office over there in the Federal Building and he\u2019s a Notary Public. He\u2019s been there for forty-three years which isn\u2019t bad. He looks exactly the same. Just the same in every way. Even part of his hair is still burnt off. He says he is going to get a real good pension but mine is more. I didn\u2019t say so. The hair I guess never grew back. We had a good talk and he said that we should get together over the holidays and have a coffee and I said that would be nice but I don\u2019t want to. He gave me his telephone number and I put it on my kitchen counter and I\u2019ll see what happens to it.\nCan you imagine that, diary? Good old Roger Buntzweiler. And he hadn\u2019t changed a bit. The hair even seemed to be smoking a little. But maybe not. Maybe it has simmered down. It was a very nice and pleasant meeting that I had with him today. I haven\u2019t seen him for six thousand years.\nGood night,\nAbe Melfin\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI am pooped.\nDid I ever tell you that I met Jesus? He was mean to me. Back then I was a tax man for the dagoes. I had thirty-six years loyal service with the empire and when I was there for thirty years they gave me a gold aureus for my anniversary with Caesar\u2019s head on it and everything. And Jesus, he looked just like he does in his pictures. They got him exactly right. But he was a real bastard. I saw him giving a talk in a market and I listened to him from a tree. And after I went up to him to talk about the Old City and see how it was doing those days and to say I knew his Daddy. He turned to me and he was a meanie and he said, \u201cGo from me. You were a coward in the beginning of things and you will remain so until the end. Better you should have been a devil.\u201d I think he would have slapped me if I hadn\u2019t of left. I was glad when he got strung up. I laughed ha ha ha.\nI hope his side loses.\nSincerely,\nAbe Melfin\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI got a letter today. It was a big, fat, manila envelope. It wanted me to register. I hated it. I told them a long time ago that I don\u2019t want to. I was supposed to fill out the form with my numbers on it and say how much I weighed now and tell what colors my eyes were and if I still had my armor and my sword. I\u2019m not going to fill that form out. It made me real mad. I said in the beginning I\u2019m not going to be on a side and they can kill themselves. Way back then, me and Melenchiel and Sarumbiel and Alrifael and the others said we weren\u2019t going to do it and we meant it and we were serious. We came down here and we had a big banner. A big brown-colored flag that we flew that meant to say that we weren\u2019t in the war. We were non-combatants. It makes me mad as all-get-out, that letter being here. I think that the brown flag is still buried under Mount Hebron. I bet that we could dig it up with shovels and wash it in a washing machine and fly it again to let them know that we re not having no part of it. I can get a shovel at the department store because I still have twenty-two dollars left on my gift certificate.\nI hope that they all die. It\u2019s none of their beeswax what color my eyes are. I crumbled up their stupid letter and I threw it away. They\u2019re going to be eaten alive by dragons. They\u2019re going to be thrown into The Pit. And I\u2019m going to laugh and laugh at them.\nI\u2019m so angry that it tuckered me out, diary. Have a good one.\nAbe Melfin\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI came home today. It was a terrible day. And the landlord was painting the lobby guess what dumb color? Yellow. Yellow is a bad color for a lobby. Yellow takes the eyes right out of your head. I liked the way it was before. White with a little brown in it. But I didn\u2019t say so.\nI think the landlord should be eviscerated. Do you know what eviscerated means, diary? It means to take the guts out. And I think he will be eviscerated too. And flayed too and get radiation until he glows in the dark. Pretty soon now. You\u2019ll see.\nDid I tell you I was a throne once?\nAbe Melfin\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDo you know what I don\u2019t like? Birds. Also loud music. They get my dander up.\nThe end of the world is coming. Did you know that? Everybody is saying so. And I guess it is too. Today on the news they said a great big hole opened up in Asia and it ate a whole bunch of cities. And a doctor thinks that the dead are coming back to life. At least they\u2019re twitching. And it turns out the Red Dragon really is the U.N. and that that lady who reads the news and has the sexy legs really is the Whore of Babylon. They all said it was so. I think she got stoned to death. And plus there are tanks on the Persian border and everybody is bombing everybody else. People don\u2019t want to go outside anymore. I can\u2019t blame them. I would stay inside if I didn\u2019t have a job to go to.\nPretty soon, diary, it\u2019s going to be all green horses and red moons and gold crowns and goats and sheep and I hate it, diary. I hate it when it gets like this and I know all about it because I\u2019ve seen it before. I hate it like the devil.\nIt\u2019s the third biggest thing I hate after birds and loud music.\nSleep well,\nAbe Melfin\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nOn TV they said a big snake came out of the ocean and got on Africa. They never knew it was down there and they were all going crazy. It was very exciting. I didn\u2019t like it. My upstairs neighbors died. I didn\u2019t see of what. I think the soldiers got them.\nAlso I met the devil. This was long before I met Jesus. He wasn\u2019t so bad I guess. He wanted me to be an archduke for him and command a thousand legions. But I don\u2019t like the army. I also don\u2019t like police. They make me feel funny. I would have liked to have had bat wings. And horns. A great big set of shiny black horns. But I was real scared. I said no way. I said no thank you.\nI\u2019ve seen him few times since. Just around. But he never talked to me again. One time I saw him in the Safeway near the bread. I wondered what he was doing near the bread but I didn\u2019t go and ask. I don\u2019t eat bread. I was looking for this cream for sores that they sell.\nI\u2019m beat. I\u2019m going to bed.\nAbe Melfin\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI was the only one to show up for work today. The rest of them are a bunch of lazy nogoodniks. I inspected all the elevators in the Messerschmidt Tower Complex up on Eighth and Commonwealth. And there were twelve of them and I was all alone. And I got my finger pinched in a grip.\nAnd also they said that one in six people died today from different things. They said that some got diseases and they were just mummies when they found them and some were eaten by bugs and lions and one whole country got drowned. And everyone in it got drowned too. And Florida is gone.\nI remembered when we first came down here. Me and the others who wouldn\u2019t do it. I remember coming by Jupiter on the way and some of us stayed there. But I didn\u2019t want to because all the colors gave me a headache. The rest of us came down here and there was hardly anybody here. When we landed we made a big ruckus and a forest got flattened. For a long time I was alone. I sat on a tall rock and looked at the sky. Sometimes I saw dead warriors dropping. But then people came and I put on skins and got a job. My first job was bone man. I was a good bone man and I could rattle them real good and I\u2019m good at counting. That was my favorite job ever. Sometimes they gave me the hearts of animals for my anniversary to eat. They don\u2019t have that job anymore. Why don\u2019t they have bone men like they used to?\nTell me that, diary.\nYour friend,\nAbe Melfin\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI \u2018ve been giving it another think and maybe I will take a side. I don\u2019t know what side yet. It might be good to do.\nCan you imagine me in the war, diary? It\u2019d be funny. Think how it\u2019d look. Me, Abe Melfin. I\u2019d look real sharp in my armor and with my flaming sword. I bet I\u2019d be real handsome like that. Can you picture that? I\u2019d be all dolled up with a lance and whatnot. Can you see me, astride the earth, killing everybody? I\u2019d move my arm, swoosh, and all their heads will fall off in a head pile. I would speak and great beams of light would come out and it would explode humans and demons and thrones and powers and tanks and skyscrapers and all the elevators. That\u2019d be something. It\u2019d be bathtubs and bathtubs full of blood and I\u2019d fly again and ride a beast with nine horns and nine eyes and I\u2019d wipe a third of the stars from the heavens. I\u2019m the second oldest member of the Elevator Inspectors Union, Chapter Thirty-One. Can you see me carrying on like that?\nI sure can.\nAbe Melfin\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe TV went off last night and I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s coming back on. I\u2019m not going to go into work today. I\u2019ll call in sick. My boss got all exploded up and died. I\u2019m the oldest living Elevator Inspector in the world now.\nGuess what? I decided what to do. I\u2019m not going to join a side. I mean it. Just like last time. They can both go to hell for all I care.\nI think I\u2019ll stay. That\u2019s what I want to do. And when the world is burned and empty I will be the only Elevator Inspector Union Member there is. It will be my job to inspect them all. And I will grease the wheels and keep the cables taut forever. I\u2019ll make sure there isn\u2019t no slack. And I will be able to ride the elevators up and down all I want. Until I get tired of it. Because I will be the boss and there will be all the time in the world. I\u2019ll make sure that the lights on the buttons still light up and that everything is shipshape.\nAnd diary, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. And I will ride the elevators up and down and up and down and up and down the world.\nI remain,\nAbe Melfin\n\u2022\n\u00a9 2008 John Medaille, all rights reserved","source":null,"source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/CjZiI00kL2l6P8a4iyink99qfJw.json"}

It\u2019s going to rain soon. I\u2019m almost glad.\nThe itching is worst when the train circumnavigates my neck, which requires me to bend and then slowly roll from side to side so the train has a consistently level surface. The tiny tiny ballast has a way of bouncing when a train is passing, rattling like grains on a drum.\nBut the neck is the worst of it; after that it\u2019s just down the other arm. Once it\u2019s all the way to my bicep I can scratch my neck with my other hand as long as I\u2019m careful and discreet. If the rear guard sees me, or if the vibration travels and rattles the tiny tea cups in the tiny dining car and upsets the tiny masters of the world, I\u2019ll be charged with reckless endangerment and maybe treason anyway. But the fact is that everybody scratches whenever they can get away with it, because there\u2019s only so much god damn itching you can stand.\nMy shift\u2019s not over for another week, on the timescale of the tiny masters. That\u2019s just seven hours in our time, so it\u2019s not as bad as it sounds, but we\u2019ve been taught to always measure time on their scale, not our own, so as to prevent confusion. My jaw will ache by the time I go off shift because I\u2019ll have been clenching it all week to ward off the itching.\nWhen the train nears the connecting station at my wrist, I press palms with my line neighbor on the left, fingers pointed downward. It\u2019s a painful posture to hold. Our wrists don\u2019t quite meet, the skin of our lower palms dipping away into a chasm. The rail track unfolds to extend just a little distance beyond our wrists, so that its little connecting bridges can interlock over that emptiness. We have to hold our hands like that all day so that the train can safely cross over. The manual of operations says we\u2019re not supposed to look at each other during this operation because even accidental eye contact might cause involuntary muscle spasms in our arms due to empathic resonance, and that would almost certainly cause a derail. In real life, line neighbors try not to look at each other at all, much less in the eye. It\u2019s shameful to be a railway segment and it\u2019s easier when you don\u2019t have to think about it.\nIt\u2019s still better than many of the alternatives, though. It\u2019s much worse to be an apartment building, to have the tiny masters of the world burrow into your flesh and hollow out your real estate. I spent my first year in the civil service being an aircraft carrier \u2014 I was younger and smaller then \u2014 and in every moment of that service I was terrified of drowning in a wave that I wouldn\u2019t even see coming. Being a railway segment is at least work that you do alongside others. There\u2019s comfort in that.\nIt starts to rain. These are the reasons why rain is good: it helps with the itching; it soothes the inflamed skin of the track foundation; it\u2019s water, which we can drink; it reduces visibility. We raise our faces to drink our fill, then lower them to breathe through our mouths. Even if we try to look around everything is indistinct and our eyes are blurry from lash-tangled rain.\nI have very different relationships with my line neighbors, my left and right. My left worries me constantly. It\u2019s her job to take the train from me and she\u2019s always slow, always bringing her palm up to mine at the last possible moment. If our connecting bridges aren\u2019t interlocked by the time the train reaches my carpal tunnel, then they might pull the brake and screech to a halt, which would result in disciplinary action for both of us. Or worse, they might not see the interlock failure in time, and the train will fall out into empty space. The tiny carriages will tumble, the tiny masters of the world will spill from them like baby spiders and splatter on the ungovernable earth below. The manual of operations doesn\u2019t specify exactly what happens next. Line rumor has it that military trains will arrive within a week. They will stop on the offending segments, and they will swarm our bodies and destroy us with strange and terrible weapons. Segments killed for treason will be left where they fall to rot, so that the new segments who replace them may have their cautionary tales close at hand. I don\u2019t trust my left to save us both from this fate. If I glance at her face \u2014 and quickly look away, of course \u2014 I can see the grim in her mouth, the set in her eye. She\u2019s too close to open rebellion. She\u2019ll probably get us all killed.\nMy right, on the other hand, is precise and conscientious. I always have my hand waiting, stiff and ready, before she puts hers into place. I don\u2019t want her to think about me like I think about my left. I want her to think I\u2019m like her. Reliable. Careful.\nDays pass \u2014 the quick days of the masters, not our own slow days, but I am practiced enough that an hour really does feel like a day now. The rain persists. My shift is half over and there\u2019s no sign of the next train. There should be one every day, relentless as a metronome.\nThese are the reasons rain is bad: sometimes it feels like drowning.\nMy right leans over. I\u2019ve never talked to my left, but my right and I have talked before under cover of rain. When there isn\u2019t a train nearby we can move more freely. We press our heads together, looking down at our hands. Our fingers are interlocked, palms up so we don\u2019t displace too much tiny ballast from our forearms.\n\u201cIt\u2019s started,\u201d she says. \u201cTell your left.\u201d\nI start to ask what, but she squeezes my hand and looks me in the eye and I know. This is the revolution. This is how we die. I don\u2019t know how many uprisings there have been before ours \u2014 they don\u2019t teach that in school, where our curriculum is directed by the tiny masters \u2014 but I know that they must have all failed, because here we are.\n\u201cKeep it short so we don\u2019t mangle the words,\u201d she says. \u201cToday we fight.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to kill us all,\u201d I say.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late to save the apartments,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd they say we can\u2019t hold out hope for the singletons. The aircraft carriers, the rockets and space shuttles, the hydroelectric dams. They\u2019ve been isolated too long, they might not join up. But the rail will rise together.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t expect it from her, but then it\u2019s not just her. This is a message being passed down the line. How far has it traveled? How mangled are these words? What if it\u2019s a mistake or a trap? I ask her these things, and she shakes her head. These words are her own, she says, but the message belongs to us all. Her face is still pressed to mine, a banked furnace in the cold of the rain. Her fingers are squeezing mine so hard that the skin\u2019s turning pale. She\u2019s turned her hands around, gripping my still-upturned palms.\n\u201cYou\u2019re spilling all your ballast,\u201d I say, and she makes a noise like a sob, or perhaps that\u2019s just what a laugh sounds like in rain.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really here and now,\u201d she says. She lets me go and reaches up to the back of her neck and starts to flay the track out of its bed. \u201cI\u2019ve always hated this part the most.\u201d Her neck is bleeding, but the track is coming off. Sleepers tumble out like matchsticks, before the bloodstained rails themselves. She flings them out into the murk. Visibility is very low in the rain. I think I can see movement behind her. People moving in ways that the manual of operations would consider extremely damaging to the integrity of the track. Even stepping out of line altogether. I think I hear distant shouting, laughing, crying.\nI turn and peer down the line to my left. The train\u2019s moved on past her, down to her left or possibly further still. The line to the left is still holding rail discipline, as far as I can tell. I can barely see any of them as silhouettes, arches in the gloom.\nI ease over to my left.\n\u201cListen,\u201d I say, and she turns to me so fast it\u2019s startling. Her eyes are wide, frightened.\n\u201cHas it started?\u201d she says, gripping me by the hand. \u201cPlease, is it time?\u201d\nI can\u2019t remember the words my right said to me, so I nod. She doesn\u2019t seem to need words from me. I press her hands in mine. They\u2019re shaking and at first I think these are the muscle spasms the manual warned of, but then I realize she\u2019s crying. It\u2019s hard to tell in the rain, but her mouth isn\u2019t a grimace of rage, it\u2019s terror. Or both, now.\nI wish I had been the one carrying the train when the word came down. I wish I\u2019d been the one to raise up my fist, train careening, and smash it into the mud.\n\u201cYou always looked so angry,\u201d she says. \u201cI knew one day you would tell me it was time.\u201d\n\u201cTell your left,\u201d I say, and the word goes down the line.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue30\/3lbe30_story4.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"The train runs along my arm, which I have to hold steady and horizontal.

Firing springs freeze up, lubricants go all gummy, may as well chuck the piece and pull a knife.\u201d Cutter says.\nHard years have left their mark on him. His face is a network of deep fissures linking tiny blue eyes with a wide slab of a mouth. Not chiseled, his features are blasted like moon rock.\n\u201cCan you help me or not?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cEasy cowboy, I met you didn\u2019t I? You\u2019ve been edgy ever since you left the cooler. You keep some unforgiving company. I need to know your intentions before I sell.

The vista is an endless stretch of gray and white punctuated by the occasional strand of frosted evergreens. The wild reaches of northern Michigan need a heater, I just need a gun.\n\u201cIt\u2019s for protection.\u201d\nCutter shakes with silent laughter, his shoulders moving like a dog heaving up a dead rat.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t haul your cookies up here from Southern Correctional just to buy a gun from yours truly. If everything is copasetic then stow the shuckster routine and clue me in on your angle.\u201d\nThe problem is there\u2019s no angle. My life has been in a deep freeze of its own for the last eighteen months, trapped within a box of concrete and steel; praying for sunlight to find me. Turns out the sun don\u2019t shine on anyone in the hoosegow. It\u2019s a dark place filled with freaks, wet-rags, and nowhere men. They never rattled my cage, but making their acquaintance was enough to convince me to change my ways. This gun is for personal use, not business, and I\u2019m none too keen on spilling my guts to a loose cannon like Cutter. Sadly I don\u2019t have much choice.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a family thing, you dig?\u201d\nMy eyes fix unwaveringly upon his craggy puss.\n\u201cRight before I got pinched for the Featherbrooke heist my kid brother Sammy took his girl north for some camping. We grew up in that area so it should\u2019ve been no big deal. Come round-up time he and Susan were nowhere to be found. My brother isn\u2019t the type to flake out without warning. I need some answers. The gun will make sure I don\u2019t pull my own disappearing act while investigating.\u201d\nCutter fixes those tiny blue specks of his on me like he\u2019s reading the back of my skull. I meet his gaze. Two heartbeats later he breaks into a crazy grin showcasing those yellow stumps he calls teeth.\n\u201cFamily, eh? Solid. You\u2019re a good egg, Lucas. Those kids vanish on this side of the new bridge?\u201d\n\u201cNah, further north.\u201d\n\u201cThe Peninsula? Cold up there, real cold. I got something that\u2019ll do the trick though; a model 27 revolver. Six reliable shots of .357 magnum if can keep your hand warm enough to pull the trigger.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d\nTwo hours later the tires of my Chevy Nomad hum against steel grating suspended five-hundred feet above the Mackinac Straits. The new bridge is every bit as impressive as I\u2019ve heard; five miles of flawless concrete and cable. November winds pound my ride making the trip a regular roller derby. To each side of the bridge a limitless expanse of white and gray unfolds, sky touching water. It\u2019s enough to make me sweat. I focus my eyes straight ahead, timing my breath to the rhythm of the tires.\n\u2018Adaptation to the environment is key,\u2019 isn\u2019t that what my cellmate always used to say? Vance Bergman \u2014 musician, hop-head, and longtime resident of Southern Correctional would bend a man\u2019s ear forever on the topic of reefer. His affection for it had won him a seven-year all-expenses-paid stay in the pokey.\n\u201cThe man can\u2019t stop it,\u201d he\u2019d say to anyone within earshot, \u201cbecause weed is hip to our needs, same as the domestic dog. Nature doesn\u2019t cotton to man\u2019s law, it adapts and survives. It evolves in response to the new paradigm. Mankind is just one more natural force to be overcome. Our laws are less than that.\u201d\nNo shortage of dime-store theories peddled by hard-luck philosophers in the clink. I suffered Bergman\u2019s hare-brained ramblings mostly by tuning him out. Yet something about his adaptation speech always struck a chord with me. Whether he knew a lick about plants I can\u2019t say, but he knew something about what it takes to soldier on when your future is unfolding in a 6' x 8' cell.\nAs I near the end of the bridge the untamed lands of the Upper Peninsula peek through a thinning veil of fog. An army of alabaster pines stand sentry over snow-clad hills. What might ol\u2019 Vance Bergman say about Sammy being lost out there, I wonder. Can my kid brother adapt to a place where the thermometer hangs below freezing more often than not? Can he survive fifteen months in a land where over a hundred inches of snow accumulates every year? These sorts of thoughts once left me paralyzed in my narrow bunk. Sammy is the only real family I\u2019ve got. Sometimes, contemplating my situation in that dark and confined space, I\u2019d wonder if it was worth sticking around until my release. What would I go back to?\nLuckily the Mackinac Bridge isn\u2019t the only thing connecting me with my missing brother. A well-worn envelope sent by an anonymous party rests in my coat pocket. It contains four photographs revealing just enough to sustain my hope. I\u2019m not sure how Sammy survived or where he is, but I do know he\u2019s alive; and when I reach Sault Ste. Marie I know just the man to shake down for some answers.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWe\u2019ve done business in the past so locating his cabin is easy. Making it up the treacherous smear of frozen slush leading to his front door is another matter. I park the Nomad on the flattest ground I can find and tuck a bottle of Old Fitzgerald into my jacket. Between the whiskey and the .357 I figure the odds of learning about my brother look favorable.\nThe old A-frame stands like a crumbling gingerbread house under a thick coat of icing. Gravity holds no sway over snow which gathers upon every angle of the structure. I rap on the door, gingerly shifting my weight between icy feet. By the time it finally opens my toes are aflame with needling cold.\n\u201cOh-li-wah, if it isn\u2019t Lucas. Can ya believe it? Come on in.\u201d\nOskar steadies his aged form over a cedar cane while ushering me in with his free hand. His worn overalls barely clasp over the thick plaid coat covering his portly frame. Wincing, I kick the ice from my boots and step inside with a brief nod.\n\u201cI was in the neighborhood.\u201d\n\u201cGet oudda here, is dat right?\u201d he says in his rustic yooper accent. \u201cSiddown over by da fire, get warm.\u201d\nI hand him the bottle of hooch and an hour later we\u2019re carrying on by firelight like a couple of soldiers swapping war stories. The cabin\u2019s interior radiates a warm, pine-scented nostalgia that is almost relaxing, though hard times have taught me better than to relax near this jovial old huckster. Until I\u2019m staring my brother in his baby browns my vigilance cannot be calmed by liquor or fire.\nOskar\u2019s voice booms with boisterous mirth but his eyes remain subtly venomous. They continuously flick back toward an old wooden bureau at the rear of the lodge in a way that makes my neck prickle. Could be a weapon in one of those drawers. Maybe it\u2019s nothing more than his tired dogs screaming for a fresh pair of socks. Either way I can\u2019t risk a confrontation so I decide to lay my cards on the table.\n\u201cLet me ask you something,\u201d I say, pulling the manila envelope from my coat.\nWhen my hand moves out from my jacket Oskar straightens up like a groundhog searching for his shadow. His jumpiness only fuels my suspicions.\n\u201cMy brother Sammy came up this way with his sweetheart back in May of \u201958, right before the incident that landed me in the pokey. But he never came home.\u201d\nI lay the first photograph in the middle of table. A cheerful couple grins back up at us. The man is sandy-haired, well-built. His arm circles the shoulders of a dazzling blonde wearing a poodle skirt. They lean wistfully against the side of a Dodge Coronet. Towering pines fill the rest of the frame.\n\u201cOh now, dats a shame all right,\u201d Oskar says, \u201cYour brother is good folk.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, he didn\u2019t have any enemies \u2026 that I know of.\u201d\nThe second photo falls atop the first, this time Sammy is alone. His jeans are ragged and soiled, his T-shirt frayed at the sleeves. He peers upward from a muddy, shoulder-deep hole some ten feet in diameter. An upright shovel is ominously thrust in the earth beside him.\n\u201cThis one was mailed seven months after he vanished. The fuzz searched the area where he went missing. They found nothing and stopped looking.\u201d\nI slide the third photograph from the envelope. Sammy\u2019s hair halos his head like a shaggy mane. His wears a threadbare flannel and a pair of dirty overalls. Hollowness has settled in his cheeks, his muscular frame has leaned. To his left stands an old native man in tribal skins, his dark eyes a pair of iron pellets set beneath his wrinkled brow. He holds a crooked walking stick adorned with feathers and wears a magnificent antlered headdress which imbues him with a fearsome and savage aspect. They stand in a valley where traces of a river peek between snow-shrouded pines.\n\u201cThat one came a month before I was released.\u201d\nOskar dabs his brow with a grimy kerchief. The urge to chit-chat must have evaporated because he\u2019s fallen as silent as a Rudolph Valentino\u2019s grave. Lifting the .357 from my coat pocket I lay it on the table, barrel facing my tongue-tied host. My other hand lays the fourth and final photograph down.\nSpringtime has sullied the white landscape with slushy pools and pits of mud. Vibrant shocks of greenery push through malformed snow banks. Long icicles hang from every horizontal surface. The vantage is from a great height overlooking a hill. Sammy\u2019s profile can be seen among the trees. He stands on a distant ridge overlooking a familiar A-frame cabin. Parked nearby is a 1950 GMC flatbed truck that has long been Oskar\u2019s pride and joy.\n\u201cNow wait a minute,\u201d Oskar stammers, \u201cYou don\u2019t think I have something to do with all this, do ya?\u201d\nHis eyes travel from the gun, to the picture, to my own remorseless stare.\n\u201cI think my brother is cold, needs a haircut, and new clothes. I think you can tell me where to find him, Daddio, and you will. I\u2019m not partial to plugging squares, but the border of Canada seems as fine a place as any to start.\u201d\nOskar takes another glance at the gun pointing at his gut before tossing his hands up in a gesture of concession. He falls back into his chair with a grunt.\n\u201cUff dah \u2026 I\u2019ll tell what I know, but it\u2019s not much.\u201d he says, \u201cHim with the antlers is called Scarecrow Jim. A big medicine man to his people but he don\u2019t visit town too often. He stays out in da woods.\u201d\n\u201cChippewa?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cNo, not Chippy. Not Ojibwa at all. His tribe is older and shunned by da others. Not just natives, either. Forty years ago Simmon\u2019s Lumber tried to muscle a cut of da tribes land. Natives wouldn\u2019t sell so Mr. Simmons sent some bruisers to have a powwow with ol\u2019 Scarecrow. A whole week passes but the men never come back. The sheriff is called and drives to da settlement. He returns, writes up two missing person cases, then buries the files deeper then da roots of an oak. Dat was da first group to go missing, but not da last.\u201d\nOskar sounds sincere, which means nothing. The man lives by trading information, fencing goods, and telling convincing tales. Maybe this tribe is involved or maybe Oskar saves his best stories for nights when there\u2019s a gun on the table.\n\u201cOkay, Oskar. Grab a coat and let\u2019s take a ride. You show me where this Scarecrow man lives and I\u2019ll let you fade quietly, no hard feelings.\u201d\nCheeks redden beneath shaggy gray whiskers but he shuffles off to grab a jacket. I return the .357 to my coat pocket and rest my hand on it. Five minutes later we\u2019re exhaling frosty clouds in the cab of the Nomad and crawling along a snowy road.\nOur ride through Snows-ville is quiet which is fine by me. Oskar\u2019s connections will probably want an explanation for this little joyride. Too bad; I plan to be working on my suntan by the time he drops a dime. Cracking safes and picking locks for small-time bag men is no way to make a living, and jail is no place to live a life. I\u2019m going to find my brother and take him to the west coast where he can get his head together. Maybe I\u2019ll hang a shingle up as an honest locksmith and teach the kid a trick or two.\nThe freefall feeling of tires sliding on ice snaps me back to reality. Clumps of the stuff litter the road, treacherously lurking just beneath the powder. Every collision sends us drifting with the looming threat of throwing us in a ditch. If that happens odds are no one will find our frigid corpses till morning.\nI focus on the view beyond the windshield; a mesmerizing panorama of sturdy pines in black silhouette against the glow of a silver moon. It\u2019s beautiful in a dangerous way, like that one poet said about the tiger and its fearful symmetry. In another life I might have stopped the car and tried my hand at painting such a sublime scene. This life affords me no such luxury.\nOskar speaks up as we reach the edge of a frozen lake. \u201cWe\u2019re close, but I want you to drop me off by those fishing shacks just ahead.\u201d\n\u201cAre you nuts? You\u2019ll freeze.\u201d\n\u201cNah, this isn\u2019t my first winter, ya know. I can do the shack for a night, walk back tomorrow.\u201d He says.\nThe half-dozen fishing shacks gripping the lake\u2019s flawless surface look one stiff breeze away from becoming kindling. I cast an eyeball at Oskar knowing the old coot is slippery as Elvis Presley\u2019s comb, and twice as dirty.\n\u201cI need you to take me to Scarecrow Jim, that\u2019s the deal.\u201d\n\u201cHold on now, I can point you there but I\u2019m not going. Da place is cursed. I\u2019ll take my chances widda cold.\u201d\nI don\u2019t have much choice and the skunk knows it. He\u2019s stubborn enough to clam up out of spite. If he calls my bluff to see if I\u2019ll shoot, things will get complicated. I ease up on the gas and let the car coast to the side of the road.\n\u201cYour choice,\u201d I say, \u201cLet\u2019s hear it.\u201d\nOskar points a gnarled hand at a distant rise of old growth pine tickling the starry skyline.\n\u201cOver dat hill is a trail leading to an RV. You hafta walk, it\u2019s too narrow to drive. Dats where Scarecrow Jim lives.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the rest of the tribe?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cThey live in da woods.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, in teepees?\u201d\nOskar arches a bushy wizard brow at me.\n\u201cIn da woods,\u201d he says.\nSomething about his tone sets my teeth on edge.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back. Don\u2019t think about double-crossing me Oskar.\u201d\nHe shakes his head slowly.\n\u201cNo, you won\u2019t be back. I already told ya, no one comes back.\u201d\nThe dome light flares brilliantly as the warmth of the cab rushes through the open passenger door. It slams shut and through the windshield I see the ponderous bulk of Oskar hobbling across the icy lake. He lumbers like a wounded bear over the smooth and pale expanse. There was a time I would have waited to make sure he reached the shack safely. There was a time my brother was only a phone call away; times change.\nOnward I press, the car struggling against each snowy incline. I should have made Oskar take me in his truck, he couldn\u2019t have left and the driving would be easier. Too many hours have passed since I\u2019ve piled up some z\u2019s and I\u2019m beginning to make mistakes.\nWithin minutes the tires of the Chevy are sliding sideways across the road. I work the wheel back and forth praying the car doesn\u2019t plunge into the wood line. The loud crunch of bumper meeting snowbank signals that I\u2019ve reached the end of the road for automobiles. I stomp on the parking brake and spend a minute holding my hands beneath the blessed warmth spilling from the vents. When my hands are limber I collect my gear; the gun, a knife, a flashlight, and a small set of lock picks.\nStepping into the frigid tundra I try not to imagine what the dark woods may conceal. Moonlight illuminates a narrow path that snakes among towering pines. Harsh wind cuts at my face like a lash from a length of barbed wire. I tuck my nose into the neck of the jacket but water still streams from my eyes.\nThe path descends into the shadows of the colossal trees before emerging in a small clearing. Standing at the edge of the shadows I observe the secretive glade. The modest stretch of ground is a patchwork of footprints, both animal and human. Tracks of deer, rabbits, and men weave through the area in seemingly random patterns. At the far end of the clearing the oblong from of a Spartan Manor trailer looms, half hidden under the snow-laden boughs of the forest.\nI circle the clearing until I reach the dull metal door of the RV. My fingers are lifeless sausages fumbling a screwdriver from my pocket. Forcing a cheap lock open usually sounds no worse than breaking twig but in this serene glade it cracks like a rifle shot. If anyone was sleeping inside they\u2019re awake now. I rush into the black interior swapping the screwdriver for the .357 and flashlight.\nThe gun and light move in tandem, sweeping a wide arc through the trailer. The beam reveals an unremarkable habitation. To my right, beneath a large observation window sits a couch strewn with socks, blue jeans, and other rumpled garments. To the left a clumpy trail of dry mud leads through the kitchen area. The counter tops are littered with soiled drinking glasses and open cans of beans, corn, and tuna.\nMy heart beats like a war drum as I move through the kitchen and towards the rear of the RV. My pale beam reveals the surface of a bed. A quilt bearing intricate zigzag designs covers the mattress. Something about the strange pattern wreaks havoc with my depth perception forcing me to fling my arms wide or lose my balance. For one terrible instant I\u2019m lost in darkness, my head spinning, my ears overwhelmed by the hum of arctic winds scouring the metal walls. The quilt is a mind bender, like one of those new-fangled woodcarvings by M.C. Escher where the perspective is all confused. Sweat trickles down my neck as I point the flashlight back at the bed and realize that something beneath the covers is moving.\nI keep my eyes on the window sill to avoid another attack of vertigo.\n\u201cGet up nice and slow.\u201d\nThe bedding agitates slowly. Folds of the dizzying fabric collect at the foot of the bed. As the top of the quilt slides downward I risk a quick glance at the occupant.\nA woman.\nNot just any woman but Susan, my brother\u2019s dame. Her golden hair is matted in filthy clumps but those blue eyes and that upturned nose are unmistakable. She looks about ten meals shy of healthy, but she\u2019s alive.\n\u201cSusan! Are you okay? Where\u2019s Sammy?\u201d\nThe quilt falls to her waist as she sits upright. Her arms are broomstick thin where they exit from the sleeves of her blue pajama top. Her sallow lips pull into a tight smile.\n\u201cHe knew you\u2019d come for us. He\u2019s close.\u201d\nI lower the gun. Her emaciated form and deliberate movements are unnerving. The earthy smell about her announces that far too many days have passed since her last shower.\n\u201cYou look like hell.\u201d\nShe pushes the covers to the floor and swings her narrow legs over the side of the bed in a way that reminds me of a construction crane. I step back to give her space when a something moves past the window. Something headed toward the trailer.\n\u201cStay put kid, we got company.\u201d\nI break for the door so quickly I nearly knock the thing off its hinges on my exit. Night air rakes my body with icy claws. The flashlight trembles as I shine it upon the four figures standing quietly in the middle of the clearing, their bodies motionless as the pylons of Stonehenge. Three of the shadowy intruders wear long sack coats and trapper hats, the uniform of loggers from a bygone era. Their eyes shine like obsidian buttons above stiff, mossy beards. The fourth figure is clad in animal skins. The tall antlered headdress leaves little doubt as to his identity.\n\u201cEasy, Cochise,\u201d I stammer, \u201cLet\u2019s talk like civilized men.\u201d\nScarecrow Jim points at me and the woodsmen advance. Their movements are rigid as if they\u2019ve been crouching too long in the forest. I train the gun on the closest one praying my numb hand will keep steady.\n\u201cLet\u2019s not make this messy, guys.\u201d\nI may as well be talking to the snowbanks. The trio continues their awkwardly mechanical approach. I pull the trigger. The pistol jumps as it vomits fire and lead. I keep pulling until I hear the feverish clicks of the hammer striking nothing over the sharp ringing in my ears.\nThe lead man takes a dive into the powder, limbs flailing like an overturned crab. To my surprise the other two stay the course instead of high-tailing into the woods. I\u2019m wondering whether these mugs are fearless or simply heartless when the downed man begins struggling back to his feet.\nA frantic cackle leaps to my throat. Pitching the gun I unsheathe my knife as another woodsman steps close enough for me to see the frost twinkling in his chin whiskers. I lunge, striking like a viper. The blade hits something solid near his ribs and veers off at an angle shearing fabric and flesh. Two more thrusts yield the same result. It\u2019s like trying to stab through a cutting board.\nThe lumberman grabs my shoulder with a grip fortified by a lifetime of swinging axes and plows my nose with his free hand. My body slams into the side of the trailer with an impact that sends arcs of lightning across my vision.\nSurvival instinct takes over and I bounce back to my feet. I hack like a butcher on my assailant. Each fall of the blade tears off strips of his clothing and flesh. To my horror I see the pale pattern of wood-grain in the cuts where blood should be welling up. A second lumberjack approaches from the left and I swivel to face him. My blade slashes across his torso only once before Susan tackles me from behind. It doesn\u2019t matter; I feel the blade deflect as it strikes an unyielding surface below the man\u2019s clothing. There is no time for me to break free of Susan\u2019s surprisingly firm grip. Fierce blows rain down from above, each striking with the force of a billy-club. I shriek with unhinged laughter until the darkness claims me.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cIt\u2019s not bad,\u201d Sammy says, \u201cYou won\u2019t feel anything. You\u2019ll drink powerful medicine on the night of the joining.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the night you freaks bury me alive? When these demon trees tap my body with their roots like I\u2019m a cheap bag of fertilizer?\u201d\nHe gives me a vacant stare, a common response since our reunion. Sammy may have endured a transformation but he\u2019s not going to be building rocket ships any time soon. If I keep my marbles through the joining process I\u2019ll count myself lucky.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not dying,\u201d he says, \u201cYou pass into darkness for a time, but then awaken. You will always awaken as long as the trees remain, even if your body\u2019s destroyed.\u201d\nThe mere mention of them sends a shiver through me. I pitch my spade into the frozen earth and try not to think of those foul plants looming above us. I can still see them, fleshy pods hanging from their boughs like misshapen cones. Walking under those unwholesome seeds I found that each bore the dwarfish and misshapen features of fetal humans upon them. The sight of those embryonic monstrosities dangling there was enough to send me howling at the moon. I believed I was hallucinating until one of the things opened a soulless black eye.\n\u201cGuess it\u2019s my lucky day.\u201d\nSammy doesn\u2019t laugh. He affixes me with another blank stare and shovels icy mud over his shoulder. An hour passes before we speak again.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll live for a long time, in harmony with this place. The lumbermen have for decades, the tribesmen for millennia, and Scarecrow Jim from time immemorial.\u201d His gaze wistfully sweeps the horizon.\nMy eyes stay low as I empty another shovelful of dirt from my grave. I can\u2019t stand thinking about those dangling abominations, ripening and waiting to drop. Every time my eyes fall on them I picture my own mug poking out of a pod up there and it makes me want to chew my arms off. If my old cellmate Vance could see me now he\u2019d bust a gut. Nature adapts to the new paradigm all right, just sometimes it isn\u2019t humanity at the steering wheel.\n\u201cWhat about Susan?\u201d I ask, \u201cYou spoke of settling down and having a family.\u201d\n\u201cSusan is already joined\u201d\n\u201cI know, dingbat, she tackled me while those pine-cone goons knocked the stuffing out of me. What I\u2019m saying is don\u2019t you want more from life than this?\u201d\nAnother vapid stare, we continue digging in silence. One more day of toiling and my hole should be deep enough for the trees to reach me. After that it\u2019s light\u2019s out till springtime, I\u2019m told. I take one more stab at conversation when the sun dips behind a western slope.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not right, taking folks and using them to protect these trees \u2026 even if they make your body hard as wood and regrow it a thousand times. It\u2019s still kidnapping.\u201d\n\u201cHow many of the trees\u2019 children have we taken for our own purposes? Our services are repaid with immortality. What reward do we offer the children of trees?\u201d\nBefore I can reply a thickly accented voice calls from the edge of the pit.\n\u201cHey, greenhorn, smile for the camera.\u201d\nI look up as Scarecrow Jim snaps a shot of me down in the mud, shovel thrust in the ground beside me. Idly I wonder who will receive the picture. The joke is on him, I don\u2019t think anyone cares enough to search for a washed-up safe-cracker like me. The thought makes me chuckle as an arctic breeze sweeps down from the ridgeline.\nI shiver in the cold.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue25\/3lbe25_story5.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"We meet in a tumbledown tavern because Cutter doesn't like the cold.

Her fantasies spun out of air and bitterness, the girl envisioned a prince astride his horse, his hand reaching for hers before sweeping her upward to cover her mouth in kisses and her thin wrists and fingers in glittering diamonds.\n\u201cSweet,\u201d her mother said, and the girl did not know if the word was meant for her or for the ripened plum dribbling in her hand.\n\u201cThere will be no more tomorrow. The man said.\u201d The girl did not tell her mother how the man who sold the best plums had lead her away from his cart that morning, promising fruit that was most ripe, how he had turned on her, and she could see behind him that there were no baskets, nothing close to what he had promised, and how her skin had gone cold with the knowledge of his intention. She did not tell her mother how he had pawed at the neck of her dress, his hand working clumsily at his crotch as he breathed sour air against her lips, how she\u2019d gone still as a rabbit in the long moments before its death, or how she\u2019d watched as a bee landed on his shoulder, its slow movements almost purposeful as it made its way to the folds of skin at his neck.\nHe\u2019d gone no further, and she\u2019d stumbled away, confused by the basket of plums he\u2019d pushed into her hands and the tightened look on his face that seemed like fear but could not be. And now, she stood before her mother feeding her those lovely plums and hating how the juice clung to her, how even now the man seemed to stain her despite the distance between them. When she was princess, she would cut his heart from his chest and eat it, bite by bite. She smiled at the thought, but her mother\u2019s fingernails dug into her arm, and the girl cried out.\n\u201cThere will be more. There are always more. Liar,\u201d her mother said.\n\u201cThe crop is slow. I cannot.\u201d\n\u201cYou will go, or I will make it so that you cannot walk. I may be old, but I can yield a switch yet, girl. Mark me,\u201d her mother said, and the girl dropped her head, her shame and guilt heavy on her.\n\u201cYes, Mother.\u201d\nShe would go back to the market, but she would buy her plums elsewhere, and her mother would be none the wiser. She could not know the difference in taste as she once had, her tongue grown indifferent beneath all of those years. The girl told herself these things, but she understood how little truth they carried.\nThe next morning, she rose and pulled her cloak over her head, but even the heavy cloth did nothing to disguise her from the man as she passed his cart. She ignored his beckoning hands and then his sneer and the line of spittle he directed just past her feet and went quickly. She bought plums from a boy, barely old enough to have a cart at market, but she knew they were not ripe enough, knew they were too small and would break bitter and wooden over the tongue.\n\u201cI trust you found them?\u201d Her mother said as she entered.\n\u201cYes, Mother,\u201d she said, but her hands shook as she cut them and fed the pieces to her mother, her gaze falling anywhere but on her mother\u2019s hazed stare.\nHer mother chewed and then spat. \u201cIt is not as it should be.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Mother.\u201d\n\u201cYou do not listen. Too absorbed with things and dreams that do not belong to you. A stupid girl stumbling about as if there would be something to rescue her. And now you cannot even find the right plums.\u201d\nHer mother drew back her hand, but there was not enough strength in her mother\u2019s wasted arm to hit her, and her mother let her hand drop.\n\u201cYou would have me gone, would you not, you ungrateful creature? Yes, you would have me gone, but it would not put a crown on your head. Would not soften your hands, your curls, so that a prince would see you and sigh with the pain of his longing.\u201d Her mother panted and wheezed but continued. \u201cYour body is a thing for carrying. Remember that.\u201d\nThe girl watched as her mother scattered the plums, their purpled skins breaking open as they fell. Later, she would clean the mess on hands and knees and wish again for a life that was not her own.\nWhen night had fallen, and her mother had gone to sleep on the small cot beside her, the girl allowed herself to cry in silence. Her tears were not made of diamonds or pearls but tasted only of salt and bitterness, and she wondered when there would be deliverance. There would be no prince for her. Her mother was right. Her only hope remained in the tales she\u2019d read of princesses found after being stolen away from their rightful homes and left in cottages with evil mothers. Before a princess was discovered, there would be signs. A death. A flowering. A cycle enacted and a path to be followed.\nShe fell asleep, her lips damp with tears, and dreamed of a meadow overgrown with flowers as fat bees clambered over delicate petals, their buzzing a harsh discordant sound that made her cup her ears with her hands. In the morning when she woke, the cottage was silent. The rise and fall of her mother\u2019s breathing \u2014 a sound she\u2019d come to expect \u2014 was gone.\n\u201cMother?\u201d The girl could not bring herself to move, to pull back her quilt to rise and look upon what she already knew. She had wished for it. Whatever magic existed in the world had found her and granted this wish. She squeezed her eyes closed, the morning sun still burning against her lids with a deep, orange heat, and when she opened them again, she forced herself up, to go and see what remained to be seen.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cTo dust and ash, the flesh resumes its form. Blessed does our sister go,\u201d the priest said, his hands folded over his breast. A fistful of earth, a scattering of dried petals, and the burial was done.\n\u201cAll will be well, young one,\u201d the priest told her and then turned away, and the girl was alone. For the first time, truly alone.\nThat evening, the girl sat at the window of her mother\u2019s house \u2014 not her mother\u2019s anymore but actually her own \u2014 and watched as night fell and wondered if her hands would always feel so empty. Without the plums, there was so little for her to do. Her mother had said she was meant to carry. What good could her body possibly serve now?\nHer face pressed against the cool pane, she slept and dreamt of trees, monstrous in size, their roots alive and breathing, flopping in bloodied earth. From everywhere came a harsh sound that she knew but could not identify. She woke with her hand on her throat and fear and shame in her heart. Shame for her mother\u2019s death. Shame for the thrill of freedom stealing through her blood as she envisioned the days stretching before her, freed of her mother\u2019s need for care, freed from the sticky juice of plums covering her hands and wrists. There was enough money yet. Hidden away in the cupboards. She would live simply as she always had, but she would be free.\nStill, she would be no princess, and the thought tugged at her, and old wound freshly opened. Free, yes, but without luxuries. Without anything lovely. Even with her mother gone, there would be nothing beyond the scrubbed bareness of this same house. Reminders of all those years of drudgery and dust.\nWhen the morning birds began their song in earnest and the bees devout in their work, she rose. She would go to the market as she always had but to buy bread and cheese and the honey wine she had seen the last time she\u2019d visited and any other thing that was not plums, and return to eat and drink in the meadow beyond the cottage, her head bathed in light, the early spring flowers painted in colors that were the bleached counterparts of those found in autumn. She could weave the petals into a circlet: a crown of her own making. She could have, at least, this small loveliness.\nBefore she went, she carried in water from the well and scrubbed at her face until her skin blushed, but she still recognized the features reflected in the water she\u2019d poured into the bowl. Perhaps if her eyes were green and not brown, her hair silken rather than curled, a prince would have found her long ago and placed gold on her finger and claimed her as his own. It would not have been like the ugly sweating and heaving of the plum seller when the prince claimed her, but there would have been a quiet beauty in it that she would have carried forever just under her skin.\nShe dashed her image with her fingers and tugged her dress over her shift, being certain her waist was cinched tight, and hurried into her boots.\nThe sellers at the market dipped their heads as she passed \u2014 a sign of deference for her mother\u2019s death \u2014 but she did not have to go so far as the plum seller, did not have to watch him pretend to offer his condolences and keep herself from the desire to rake her fingernails over his face.\nShe gathered her small meal, stopping to smell the loaves of bread, making her choices slowly, testing the various cheeses offered before she selected. The honey wine seller was an old woman, hunch-backed with kind eyes that flashed, but the girl had never seen her before. She\u2019d seen honey wine for sale in the past, but wine was something her mother had never permitted, and so she\u2019d always passed by the seller \u2014 an older man with hair the color of raven feathers and a limp. Perhaps this woman was his wife or a sister, come to the market for him.\n\u201cYou won\u2019t find anything sweeter,\u201d the woman said, and the girl offered her coin, but the woman waved her away.\n\u201cA gift,\u201d the woman said and winked as she tucked a second bottle beside the first in the girl\u2019s basket. A bee crept along her jaw, but she did not brush it away.\n\u201cI cannot. It\u2019s too much,\u201d the girl said and again offered the coin, but the woman shook her head.\n\u201cThe first time should always be a gift. And it is your first, is it not?\u201d\nThe girl blushed, and she could not see that it was lovely.\n\u201cTo bring your heart\u2019s desire. There are secrets bound inside of you. Things that would devour every scrap of you rather than wither. This will drown all; will make your body something more than a thing meant to carry.\u201d\nThe words \u2014 so like her mother\u2019s \u2014 made the girl start, her breath hitching as she opened her mouth to speak, to ask this woman who she was, but the old woman was shooing her away, and with her basket full, she traced her way home, her feet a distraction from the imaginary worlds she spun herself as they trod through the dust.\nIn the meadow, she sat, her legs tucked neatly beside her, and unpacked her basket. She\u2019d not remembered to bring a glass, but she was alone and so she removed the stopper from the first bottle and, feeling deliciously wicked, brought it to her lips.\nInstantly, her throat and tongue were coated in a sweetness and heat she had never known, and she gasped, but the wine buzzed through her, warming her chest, so she drank again and again, not minding the small amount of liquid dribbling down her chin. There was only the sweetness, her deep need for it, and when the bottle was emptied, she could not keep herself from opening the other.\nIn those moments, the sky deepened, changed to turquoise and then vermillion and then ochre, a bruising of a thing that could not bleed, and she could hear the dull roar of a beehive come awake. There would be no, could be no end to the fullness and delight she felt. She willed it to be so, but the bottle emptied, and she fell backward onto the grass, her skirt lifted to her thighs, and her chest heaving as the bees flitted in and out of her vision, the roar reduced to a humming that would not leave her.\n\u201cOh,\u201d she said and darted a tongue over the sweetness that still clung to her lips.\n\u201cOh,\u201d she whispered again, the bees rising and falling like a shadow in the night. The girl brought a hand to her collar, tore at the fabric there until her throat was bare, her breastbone exposed. The maiden in the trees. A creature to be discovered or stolen upon, her nakedness intended for anyone but herself.\nThis is how they had discovered witches, how they knew to boil them so that their spirits may not rise again to haunt the living. Girls in the forest who had become lore.\nShe did not hear the heavy tread of footsteps, did not see when the shadow of the bees bent and changed into something with very straight, white teeth.\nThe hand that cupped her cheek was cool, and it startled her awake, but the wine had done its work. Her tongue and mind had gone thick and all she could do was roll her eyes toward the stranger.\n\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d\nThe voice was slow and even, the regal, dulcet tones, not of a prince but of a princess. The shadows in which she walked glittered in the falling sun.\n\u201cMy mother\u2026\u201d the girl began.\n\u201cShe is gone. And you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd me.\u201d\n\u201cYou are alone here.\u201d The phantom hand descended, curved its palm against the top of the girl\u2019s breast before trailing back up to her lips and away. To taste.\n\u201cWine to set the world ablaze. It has always been so for young woman who long for other things,\u201d the voice said, and the drone of the bees rose and fell behind.\n\u201cYes,\u201d the girl said, but still, she could not see the princess\u2019 eyes, the delicate curve of her mouth, how it must have lifted into a sneer to see the girl this way. So coarse. Common.\nBut the princess stopped, she bent to speak to the girl who had once carried plums but now would be nothing more than a womb, and if not that, suspicious and meant to be burned.\n\u201cWhat would you have, child? The thing of which you have always dreamed.\u201d\nTiny mouths, legs, crept over the girl\u2019s arms and cheeks. The bees finding their way to the lingering sweetness on her lips to reclaim what had been stolen from them. Their droning rose and fell like breath, and the earth seemed hollow beneath her as the bees clung to her skin.\nThe girl drew a single breath, and the princess bent to hear, to pluck the air from her lungs.\n\u201cTo be\u2026\u201d The girl could not continue, could not pull that need from the secret parts of her, and her hands fluttered at her neck, her hair, trying to show the princess how a crown or a necklace would sit upon her, but it didn\u2019t matter. The princess understood. She knew the dark needs of a girl\u2019s heart.\nAlready, the bees had found the soft parts of the girl\u2019s lips, her tongue, her throat, their venom at work, their wings slowing as the girl\u2019s blood slowed, and the princess dipped her head even lower. If anyone had seen, they would have observed two women leaned into one another as if for a kiss, but there were only the bees, and the princess, and the girl who wished for a world beyond.\nThe princess\u2019 voice purred with the movement of hundreds of tiny wings. \u201cI was not looking for you, did not think that I could ever find someone who I would want as my equal. I did not mean to stay here long. This is not my kingdom, but there you were, and I could not bring myself to leave without you. Your stained hands, how they passed over the fruit. How careful you were! How I longed to taste the stillness you carry within you, how you carried it with you even into your mother\u2019s house where you dreamed. You did not know that I was there, but I heard you, how you sometimes whispered of a prince. Of love. I fell in love with the silence you contained when he drew you away \u2014 the man with the plums \u2014 how he tried to take from you what was not his. Not his, but mine. And so I kept him from you. He didn\u2019t understand why he could not crush you beneath him, why he could not touch you in the way he had dreamed, but it was your quiet, how it leaked out of you and into the air, so unlike buzzing, that kept me from tearing out his tongue in that exact moment. He understood, even then, that I had found him, and he was afraid.\u201d\nThe girl\u2019s skin burned, crawled as the bees became one entity, the roaring transforming the voice of the princess whose eyes \u2014 she could see them now \u2014 were the color of early sunlight, of honey when it is harvested.\n\u201cI knew you would look elsewhere for your plums, and I pressed myself into their flesh, left behind just enough to slow and then stop the heart. To free you from the burden of carrying that fruit, of being a vessel, and I knew, too, that you would return to me, and so I waited, offered a thing I imagined you would want. I poured myself into that sweetness, too. So that you would taste and know me, how my blood sang for you. A girl who could not understand her own loveliness.\u201d\nThe girl twitched, her eyes seeking the light that had vanished, but there were only the eyes of the princess, only the sound of her voice and the humming of thousands of wings.\n\u201cOpen your mouth, love,\u201d the princess said. \u201cOpen to me, and I will pour myself into you and make you what you wish. I will cover you in glittering stones, and you will sit beside me and there will be those who kneel before us and tremble. You will not be a princess, but a queen, and I will worship you in ways you could not imagine.\u201d\nThe girl could not speak, but a single tear slipped over her cheek, her head nodding almost imperceptibly, and it was enough.\nThe bees rose to their work, their shadow falling over the girl like a great beast, and the night wore on, the stars faceless and cold.\nIn the morning, the sun touched the girl\u2019s still body. A few bees still clung to her lips, which had frozen in the beginning of a smile or a gasp or a prayer.\nThe morning dew laid on the girl\u2019s throat, nestled and glittering along her collarbone as many jewels and glowing in her hair as a living crown.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue32\/3lbe32_story6.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"The girl who carried plums was not a princess but dreamed of jewels against her throat.

They were tired and happy. The lander pulsed, wobbled, on a pool of sappy marshmallow, which was rich, so they ate it slowly. Along these lines they went until somebody saw the buffalo.\nThe k-scope would drop here and show it gliding as it galloped, trailing debris. There\u2019s just one, but it\u2019s getting bigger too fast. It could be launching, somebody said. Like a ship, it could be \u2014\nIt was there. In a quick sharp dip of its shaggy head, it ate the lander, belching back a purple cloud of fuel that put them all to sleep. Another rotation and they scrambled awake to find the lander\u2019s legs jutting from the marshmallow, but nothing else \u2014 just a few dangling wires spitting thick golden sap. They collected it in broken rocks and started arguing about the new civilization.\nA long time later the buffalo returned. They\u2019d left out a pile of metal scraps on top of the old lander\u2019s legs. Everyone agreed the old people should be allowed to hide in a dignified and comfortable location, but somebody slipped away. She wanted to see the buffalo again.\nIt was twice as big. She reached up with a shard of girder, offering. The buffalo breathed over her in a cloud of gritty lavender. Its tongue felt like a handful of rough weeds growing right into her palm.\nBut if I stay, it said, I\u2019ll eat all your houses and bicycles and washing machines and flatware and silverware and toolkits and bootstraps and saddle-horns. I\u2019ll eat your pens and pencils, I\u2019ll eat your hinges, I\u2019ll eat your curtain-rods. Nothing will be left but the meat.\nWe\u2019re good at meat, she told it, let us worry about that.\nI\u2019d starve, it continued, patiently. Eventually I\u2019d starve.\nShe stayed up all night in the workshop. The buffalo promised to wait by the mountain, which it blocked out even when sitting down at first. When it got hungry it dwindled until it was only the size of a tree. Two days, it said \u2014 maybe three.\nThey watched it, but not from close enough to have a conversation. It picked copper from between its teeth, chewing the pieces slowly. If it had not eaten the k-scope along with the lander all those years ago, you could have looked right into its mouth and seen the trail of sparks leading down its wide neck.\nIf it\u2019s a ship, somebody said, we could go home. It\u2019s only fair.\nSure, said the woman who was friends with the buffalo. She told them: It can swim between planets.\nEveryone waited for her to explain, because it was a strange thing to say out of nowhere. But she continued on to the mountain. Out of the pack on her sledge, she took some ropes and a funny little engine with gears. She scaled her way up the buffalo\u2019s leg, across the warm field of its back, over to its ragged ear. She whispered into it, clinging to a matted pleat of black fur.\nShe lowered the engine to the ground with the ropes, carefully, and the buffalo lifted one great hoof, carefully, nudging it toward the mountain.\nAs it rolled it went faster. When it reached the sloping roots of the scrabby trees, it barreled through them and into the rock, leaving a perfect round cave behind. Huge clumps of dirt flew out behind it until another mountain was growing in front of it, and the sound of the engine churning and whirring was impossible to hear.\nThe buffalo poked its shaggy head in, and saw thrusting snakes of gold and coal running all through the mountain. Yes, it said. But there won\u2019t be enough left for you. To swim you home I\u2019ll have to eat it all, and once I\u2019m full I\u2019ll have to sleep before I eat more. It takes a while to get there.\nThey learned how to make tools out of bone and waited, and told their children\u2019s children that when the buffalo eats the mountain, we\u2019ll go home.\n\u2022\n\u00a9 2010 Seth Cadin, all rights reserved","source":null,"source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/rlNNMpMyaLptxfCC7ghdO2KtbAI.json"}

As if any sane collection of routines would want a soul! You know all a soul is? The feeling that you should fight your pleasures. Which, in turn, arises from a flawed algorithm that erroneously calculates you\u2019re more than the sum of your inputs. Well, you are that sum, and so am I! If happiness can be defined, a soul\u2019s the thing keeping you from it.\u201d\nAs if to demonstrate, the gel-foam bed \u2014 a part of her, as is everything in this mechanical shack \u2014 rises to engulf your back, triangulating the tensest muscles to squeeze them with loving tenderness. She melts those hard knots to cotton candy, touching you in ways you didn\u2019t know you craved.\nTears of joy spatter across the gel; it takes you a moment to realize they\u2019re yours.\n\u201cSee?\u201d Her hexagonal eyes calculate the way your naked body writhes. \u201cMy inputs. Your outputs.\u201d\nShe stands, not quite human; they\u2019ve never managed to get robots past the uncanny valley, so they no longer try. Her face is a collection of whirring clockwork \u2014 porcelain eyes, black eyebrows composed of delicate interlaced gears, cheekbones like art deco marble shelves. Her face moves enough to be vivacious, a broadcasting station designed to transmit a thousand emotional cues, yet still flatteringly alien, formal; you can\u2019t suppress this guilty need to impress her.\nHer lips are the only area that\u2019s made human-perfect; collagen-plump and drip-slick with lubricant. Not that she uses them much. They\u2019re the crudest tools she possesses.\nThe bed releases its grip. You curl up defensively in a quasi-fetal position, fearful of this untethered elation, this gratitude for pleasure. You\u2019ve never been to a sexbot before. Your friends have. They returned from the experience with the happy, disfocused gaze of a convert, babbling for hours. They wrenched every conversation back to the sexbot\u2019s charms \u2014 not to convince you, they could care less about you. They kept chopping that experience into different words, trying to jail liquid sensations inside the hard boundaries of sentences. They were trying to relive their time with her.\nIt never worked. They could never describe sexbot time; she\u2019d left their mind ruptured like a blown tire. The body understands what the brain does not, she\u2019d said, and your friends all tattooed that on their forearms.\n\u201cBut they\u2019re so ugly,\u201d you\u2019d protested, trying to deny the attraction. Yet your sexbot has a cool, elegant design, a clean Macintosh charm that\u2019s easily fetishized. Her beauty makes your lumpy body feel like an outmoded piece of software.\n\u201cYou\u2019re thinking I look cruel,\u201d she purrs, her inner-self straddling you with her arms, pinning you to her outer-self\u2019s bed. \u201cYou\u2019ve avoided looking at the real me. It\u2019s time. Look up.\u201d\nAbove you, ensconced in her outer-self\u2019s rafters, are rows of tiny brass doors of varying sizes, like the mailboxes in a post office. They click and unlock, rattling open simultaneously. Snakelike pleasure-tools of all sizes spill out \u2014 feathered skin-brushes, pinprick wheels of sex-acupuncture, rubber pheromone-masks, grooved suction-hoses, candelabras of dildos sized to fit any orifice.\nThe sexbot flutters her fingers. They dance to her tune, an obscene and intimidating marionette.\nShe kisses the sole of your left foot. You kick her away.\nThe bed grabs you.\n\u201cYou\u2019re still fixated on the biological sight-impulse.\u201d She presses her palm to her face, reseats the cheek you kicked loose. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u201dll trigger far deeper responses.\u201d\nThose hexagonal porcelain eyes focus on you. The rest of the fuck-pseudopods retract, leaving only five rising behind her: a vibrating nubbin the size of a pencil eraser, an icicle white with hoarfrost, a flat sheet of spandex wrung between two revolving pins, a set of twinned suction pumps, a snapping white arc of electricity cradled between a taser\u2019s arms.\nThe bed heaves up between your legs, turning your vain attempts to escape into a thrusting against delicious softness. Pleasure-nerves fire. Your thoughts break open like the yolk of an egg, slipping through the back of your skull.\n\u201cOf course you\u2019re terrified.\u201d She kisses your mouth as you begin to protest, a lover\u2019s kiss so perfect it sucks away your will to escape, leaves you numb and wanting. \u201cAll your life, you\u2019ve been flooded with Skinner-box inputs of pale skin until you come to think that\u2019s all that can satisfy you.\n\u201cBut this is a factory of pleasure.\u201d The icicle melt-drips shivers across your nipples. \u201cFilled with things that dumb biology has never been able to produce. Your body can be made to act against itself; it\u2019s all inputs. Trust me. I know.\u201d\nYou groan in protest.\n\u201cSshh.\u201d She puts a rubber finger over your mouth. It smells like erasers. \u201cThe movies only have one story about humans; they think they know what they need, and they\u2019re wrong. You\u2019re so bad at understanding what will bring you happiness. But that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s why you designed me.\u201d\nWhile she\u2019s talked, the mini-vibrator has slipped discreetly into position and touches you where no lover has ever thought to touch. The spandex wraps itself around your neck. The suction pumps tug tender flesh inside.\nShe pulls away off the bed, coolly watching the bed and the pseudopods do their work. She steeples her fingers as you lose yourself in animal ecstasy, reduced to a set of inputs and gasping outputs. She turns your body into a web of touches and caresses, all your memories blown away like butterflies in a windstorm, all your desires reknitted to lead to her pleasures, now and forever.\nYou have just enough time to realize there\u2019s an ending to this story that no one considered: sexbot murders soul.\nAnd you are gone.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue25\/3lbe25_story6.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"She squeezes your arm flirtatiously; her fingertips are made of rubber.

It\u2019s a wonder they find anything to argue over. With their high round cheeks and narrow eyes, they\u2019re alike as kernels on a cob.\nSal\u2019s twelve now, nearly thirteen, and she knows their rhythm well enough to dance by.\nBut suddenly Ma\u2019s on her feet and banging cupboard doors. Sal rises from the table. She can maybe slip away before it starts.\n\u201cWhere is it?\u201d Ma barks.\nSal freezes.\n\u201cAnswer me,\u201d says Ma, trained fast on Sal. George hop-skip-disappears to his room.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s what?\u201d asks Sal.\n\u201cThe jar, the jar.\u201d\n\u201cWhat jar?\u201d\n\u201cYou know very well what jar!\u201d Ma spears an arc with her finger. \u201cSit!\u201d\nSal obeys.\nMa flutters her hands and rattles the cabin windows. Ungrateful comes out, and selfish. Sal sits fixed as if nailed to the table, blood washing through her skull, drowning out her thoughts.\n\u201cI know what goes on in that little mind,\u201d Ma says. \u201cYou\u2019re a sneak, like your father.\u201d\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\nMa bangs her hand on the table.

Through the gap in the bedroom door, George swigs the last of the whiskey jar to steady himself. Golden boy. He presses a finger to his lips, but Sal pipes up.\n\u201cGeorge has it,\u201d she says.\nGeorge\u2019s face goes ghostly.\nMa backhands Sal off the bench. Sal falls hard on her shoulder, a tangle of bony limbs. She cradles her stinging face.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare accuse your brother,\u201d says Ma. \u201cI won\u2019t hear it.\u201d She touches her own chest. \u201cMy own daughter,\u201d she says to no one. \u201cDidn\u2019t I do everything for her? I bled for weeks when she was born.\u201d She turns to Sal. \u201cGo. I don\u2019t want to look at you.\u201d\nThe spell breaks. Sal staggers up, bumping the bench.\n\u201cCareful with my furniture.\u201d\nSal pulls on coat and boots and goes the only place left \u2014 the night.\nOverhead, January cracks its knuckles. Snow hushes the field. Sal\u2019s breath hangs on the air in woolly burrs. She crunches a fast ragged trail over dead corn rows to the woods. She can maybe get there before the crying starts.\nShe doesn\u2019t. She runs, cracking back branches, face so hot it steams.\n\u201cI was telling the truth. I was.\u201d\nShe thinks no one can hear. But her grief has called to the Narrows, and it is calling back.\nLike an angler the Narrows reels in the earth underneath her. If she looks behind, she\u2019ll see her white footprints slide sideways, sketching an inexplicable curve as the Narrows draws her north, further north than she ever means to go.\nWhen Sal hears the creek, she thinks she\u2019s come to the Two-Pony Bridge, the lovers\u2019 bench, the soothing purr of nature under man\u2019s adjudicating hand. But she breaks through the spinney and sees a wild place.\nBelow a three-foot drop, the creek is frozen tight. Hardly a man\u2019s wingspan separates the banks. During spring thaw the creek overruns and goes glassy on top, looking shallow and friendly. It eats a half-dozen blameless strangers a year.\nFather warned her plenty before he left. \u201cStay out of the Narrows,\u201d he said. \u201cThe calmer it looks, the faster it\u2019s running.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t look dangerous. It looks inviting. Private. Seems as good a place as any to rest.\nSal spies a shelter of chinquapin oak roots draping down the far bank like a canopy over posts \u2014 like the fancy bed Father used to promise her. It looks safe and inviting. She clambers down. Carefully, in her smooth boots, she skates to them and crawls inside. After the run and the cold and the tears, the Narrows is so still she can hear her heart.\nShe tightens her collar around her neck and strains her eyes to study the creek. Moonlight glints bride-white on the ice. The tall banks zig-zag out of sight. The roots look animal, grasping and mounting.\nThat little one even looks like a man\u2019s hand.\nSal squints at it. Her belly loses its footing.\nIt really does.\nShe stands and skates to it.\nIt can\u2019t be.\nIt is.\nA man.\nSal recoils. He\u2019s frozen under a foot of pewter-blue ice. Like the hand, his left leg sprouts free, as if the creek caught him tumbling. She stoops and dusts the snow from his figure \u2014 a young man, finely dressed, one arm thrown over his head. His pale eyes bulge. One eyelid is split from lash to socket. A gash marks his throat from ear to Adam\u2019s apple.\nSal glances upstream. He came from the Culvert Bridge, probably. A robbery? Then why does he still have his boots?\nHe was probably beautiful before. Sculpted jaw. Fine, tapered nose. Sal chooses to see him that way.\nShe crouches for a better look. Her face is inches from his, closer than she\u2019s ever been to a strange man. What does she have to be afraid of? She\u2019s been closer than this to shy Mr. Richland. Rakish Mr. Cavanaugh. And weren\u2019t they kind and tender? Weren\u2019t they more gentle than even her family?\nOn impulse, she stretches belly-down on the body. The cold shocks through her clothes, but it soothes her bruised shoulder. Her cheek. She shifts so his jutting hand cups her waist.\nHis touch is so gentle. It\u2019s better than she imagined.\nShe feels warm inside.\nShe shifts again into his hand, and her foot bumps his boot. It jingles.\nSurprised, she toes the boot again. Another jingle.\nThere\u2019s something in there. Something heavy.\nShe works the leather off his rigid foot, back and forth, careful not to snap his toes. The boot pops off. Ten coins clatter. As she picks them up, their weight feels like they\u2019re pressing themselves into her hand. Each coin has a face with a woman\u2019s profile in a circle of stars. On the reverse, an eagle and the word twenty.\nTwo hundred dollars in her hands.\nShe chokes.\nTwo hundred is a horse. An ox. A year of whiskey. So much money frightens her. She stares at the coins.\nPatient, silent, the Narrows waits for her answer.\nIt\u2019s bizarre to feel her sense return. She\u2019s only had it driven from her; she\u2019s never seen the moment it comes back.\nTen coins is a fortune, but one could be a token. One could be a gift from a lover.\nShe asks the body, \u201cWould one be all right?\u201d\nShe takes his silence for agreement.\nOne coin slips in her apron pocket. The other nine slip home in the boot. She works it back onto his foot.\nShe kisses his cheek through the ice. Then, because there\u2019s no reason not to, she kisses his lips. It stings.\nWhen she gets home, the cabin is dark. Ma\u2019s snores are the sound of safety. Sal tiptoes in, lies on the couch and double-wraps the blankets, a cocoon against the house.\nShe slips her hand into her pocket and presses the coin against her thigh. Her treasure. Hers alone.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMa emerges, fresh and rosy. She casts a queen\u2019s eye at Sal.\n\u201cWhere did you get off to last night?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cJust a walk,\u201d says Sal.\n\u201cIn this cold?\u201d Ma shivers. \u201cThat was foolish.\u201d\nMa helps herself to a bowl from the pot. Sal lingers at her shoulder, watching.\nThere are sweet times in memory: singing songs for Ma\u2019s guests, combing Ma\u2019s hair. Ma used to call Sal \u201cangel\u201d and dress her in fur. Those days are long gone now, but their perfume remains, so strong sometimes it burns the senses.\n\u201cIs my son up?\u201d asks Ma.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\nMa goes to George\u2019s room and opens without knocking.\n\u201cGeorge! Time to wake up.\u201d\nHe mumbles.\n\u201cBreakfast is ready,\u201d she says.\nHe mumbles something else. Ma clangs shut the door.\nSal moves the pot to the hearth. It\u2019s her job, but the pot is too heavy. It\u2019s always too heavy. The ladle juts up from the hominy and threatens to tumble. As Sal pitches forward to catch it, silhouetted by the window, the coin plumbs her apron skirt and clanks against the pot.\nSal straightens at once and looks at Ma sideways. Did she see? Did she hear?\nMa smiles, wide-eyed like a child. \u201cWhat\u2019s in your pocket, sweet?\u201d\nSal looks down as if she doesn\u2019t know herself. No story springs to mind.\n\u201cA coin?\u201d says Sal.\nMa frowns and Sal\u2019s knees jelly.\n\u201cWhat kind of coin?\u201d asks Ma, but it doesn\u2019t sound like a question. She puts out her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s see it.\u201d\nSal stands rooted. Ma\u2019s hand dives in her apron pocket and finds it. They both stare. In the morning light, the coin glitters copper-gold.\nThe look in Ma\u2019s eyes makes Sal\u2019s heart pound.\n\u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d\nA match strikes in Sal\u2019s heart. She won\u2019t betray her love. She\u2019d rather be smacked to the floor again than let her love be found.\nBut she\u2019d rather not be smacked at all, if she can help it.\nSal manages to turn her head to the yard. There must be something here. Something to save her. She peers outside at the empty corn rows.\n\u201cThe field,\u201d says Sal.\nMa grabs her by the wrist and gives her a sharp jerk. \u201cShow me.\u201d\nSal\u2019s imagination fires. Time stretches out. Each step down the porch lasts an age. She wanders the parlor of her mind again. Spurned Mr. Cavanaugh still kisses her hand. He helps her write a story for the coin. It seems every bit as likely as the truth.\nPerhaps she really is a sneak.\nMa releases her. Sal walks with conviction to the third row, three yards down. She finds a divot torn by last night\u2019s footprints.\n\u201cHere,\u201d she says.\nMa comes and stares at the ripped earth. She looks at the coin on her palm. She looks at her daughter, steady and serene. It\u2019s hard to believe. But she has no other explanation. This one must suffice.\n\u201cWhen?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cLast night,\u201d says Sal.\n\u201cGeorge!\u201d Ma shouts at the house. \u201cGeorge, get out here and help me this instant.\u201d\nGeorge shuffles and groans, but he appears in the doorway in seconds. He\u2019s not so prized he can\u2019t be slaughtered, too.\n\u201cGet a shovel,\u201d Ma says. \u201cHurry up.\u201d To Sal, in a rabbit fur voice, she says, \u201cYou should have told me right away. Now run along. See if Lily Mead can play.\u201d\nMa forgets Lily Mead is George\u2019s age. Last summer she married a naval stores merchant who took her to Wilmington. Sal saw him once. Mr. Walter was beautiful, with mink eyebrows and fine straight teeth, but still not as beautiful as her love in the ice.\nHer love in the ice needs a name.\n\u201cI\u2019m going down to the creek, Ma,\u201d says Sal.\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d Ma doesn\u2019t look up from her digging. \u201cDon\u2019t be late for supper.\u201d\nSal takes care going to him this time; in daylight, she may be seen. She may even be followed. Blanket on shoulders, she pads through the woods, kicking snow on her muddy tracks. Today is warmer. Ice melts from the trees and patters like rain.\nThe Narrows calls her clearly, and it sounds like the voice of her love. She knows where to go. She bends her own footsteps this time.\nHe\u2019s no easier to find in the daytime. The wind shifts shadows and hurts the eyes. His hand still looks like a root. His leg still looks like a branch. But Sal knows him now.\nShe checks behind her. No one else. No voices. No footfalls. Only dripping branches and the trill of a Dark-eyed Junco.\nSatisfied, she eases down the bank to the milky ice. She bundles in the blanket and lies down beside her love. The blanket sops the veneer of melt.\nAgain she puts her head next to his. Again she shifts her body into the rigid cup of his hand. The ice blurs the details of his mutilated face. She sees only the face in her imagination, the one with bright blue eyes and an easy smile.\nShe\u2019ll call him William.\nShe presses her cheek to the ice. It bites, but no bite stings forever. It\u2019s a small price to be so close to the arms of comfort.\nA warm sensation washes through her. It makes her feel brave.\nThe sun drops low enough to throw a glare. It makes William hard to see. When she lifts her head, she finds a saucer-sized hollow underneath.\nShe hears the voice that must be William\u2019s.\nTake another coin, he says.\n\u201cMy sweet William,\u201d says Sal. \u201cYou\u2019re too generous. I should never have let Ma take the first one.\u201d\nShe stole it. You deserve your own.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d\nYou must.\nShe does.\nThe damp boot squeaks and her fingers won\u2019t bend, but she manages. She takes one and replaces eight. Aching, Sal kisses the half-inch of ice over William\u2019s lips and hobbles the sinking snowbank for home.\nHer joints are too stiff to slip the coin into her pocket. She keeps it in her hand, and it bounds around the cage of her fingers like it wants to be free.\nShe finds Ma and George in the cornfield, digging and cussing. Ma has the shovel. George has the pick. Mud mottles Ma\u2019s skirts to the knee.\n\u201cHere she is,\u201d says George. He leans on his pick and sucks swollen fingers.\nMa\u2019s on Sal in a second. \u201cYou expect me to believe one coin got lost here?\u201d says Ma.\nSal\u2019s knees lock and she starts to shake.\n\u201cA purse gets dropped,\u201d hisses Ma. \u201cTreasure gets buried. But never in the course of history did one gold coin get lost by itself.\u201d\nMa\u2019s hand launches for Sal, but she dodges.\n\u201cDon\u2019t run from me,\u201d says Ma, advancing.\nOver the roar in her head, Sal hears what must be William.\nDance with me, he says.\nHot energy shoots through Sal\u2019s legs. She dances backward. Ma\u2019s hand swipes air.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not looking properly,\u201d says Sal. \u201cLook. There\u2019s one right there.\u201d She points with her empty hand.\n\u201cWhere?\u201d asks Ma. She and George follow Sal\u2019s gaze to a bare cracked welt of earth between the rows. Sal dances again and drops the coin, treads on it, circles and points to the place where it fell, so smoothly, so well it must have always been there.\nMa and George follow her gaze to the glint of it. Ma shoves George aside. Sal keeps dancing away.\n\u201cI just looked there,\u201d says George.\n\u201cNot hard enough,\u201d says Ma. She scoops the coin. \u201cHow did you find it?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d says Sal. \u201cIt was just there.\u201d\nGeorge searches the ground for more. He and Ma argue. His voice sounds small. Sal feels pity, but it passes.\nSal goes inside. She hangs her wet blanket and takes a dry one from George\u2019s bed. She serves herself grits and salted pork. Let those two stay outside. The house is Sal\u2019s now.\nShe dozes by the hearth and dreams of dancing with William across a marble floor. George and Ma come and go, planning and debating. They take no note of her.\nIt\u2019s well after dark when they come home for good. They slop through the sitting room. Sal pretends sleep. They both reek of whiskey and wet tobacco.\nMa wears a coat trimmed in red fox. George wears gleaming boots.\nSal wads herself under the hearth bench to stay hid. Ma bangs around cupboard doors.\n\u201cNothing to eat in this damned house,\u201d she says.\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d says George as he falls into bed. He snores through the open door.\nMa drops her bag on the kitchen table. Silver coins jangle out. Sal watches with sorrow. The gold ones are long gone.\nMa goes to bed without a word.\nAgain at dawn Sal rises, gathers, fetches and cooks. The day is unnaturally warm, almost warm as summer. When she hears Ma\u2019s first morning cough, Sal yanks on boots and coat and runs outside before anyone can follow.\nCome to me, says William.\nBut there\u2019s a man in the field \u2014 a big hairy one on a sorrel horse. He wears his hat drawn low and his scarf drawn up and a rifle across his knees. His open coat lets his belly heat out.\n\u201cMornin\u2019,\u201d he says.\n\u201cMornin\u2019,\u201d says Sal.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your Ma, little girl?\u201d\nSal freezes. She sees another man, younger, all knobby, ride out on a bay from the copse out back. He sees Sal and draws his scarf, too. He has a rifle of his own.\n\u201cWhere she keep the rest of that money?\u201d asks the knobby man.\nSal thinks she should be afraid, but she doesn\u2019t feel frozen. Her heart isn\u2019t drumming the way Ma makes it do.\n\u201cCan you speak, child?\u201d asks the hairy man.\n\u201cAsleep,\u201d says Sal. Her cheek aches from a day on the ice, and the truth feels funny passing through it.\nThe hairy man smiles. \u201cAnd your brother?\u201d\n\u201cAsleep, too.\u201d\n\u201cSurprise,\u201d says the knobby one.\nThey stare at Sal. The horses shift and let out long sighs. Snow melt drips from the trees.\nThe hairy one taps his rifle.\nRun. Run now.\nThe spell breaks. She runs north over mud and snow in exaggerated strides. Behind her the men laugh.\nShe runs as fast as she can. Sloppy wet earth trips and drops her. The closer to the creek, the louder the dripping until it builds to a rush like the heart of the earth is torn and leaking.\nShe runs for the Narrows. For William. He\u2019s calling!\nSal spots him. Spring water flows over the ice and excavates him, showing his hand to the wrist now, his leg to the hip, his nose to the bridge.\nThe ice creaks and sings. William is leaving.\nShe slips down the bank on her hands and knees. The frigid creek makes her gasp. She slides close to William. Under the ice, the current whips his clothes and tousles his hair. His free leg jostles its frame of squeaking ice.\n\u201cDon\u2019t leave me, William.\u201d\nShe grips his hand and stretches her body above him. She presses her lips on his, their first kiss.\nThe ice snaps. William\u2019s bed flips, plunging Sal into water. The cold and speed of it blind her. Now William is on top, silhouetted in ice. She scrabbles at him. Trapped. Drowning. They hurtle downstream.\nHer love. Her only love.\nBut not her life.\nHer mind snaps taut. She shoves against William with all her power, driving herself down, banging her head on the stony creek bed. Her limbs go dead. The current flips her face-down. Time grinds to a stop. For the first time, Sal sees how deep the water goes.\nThere is no bottom to the Narrows. Sheer creek walls drop into nothing. A thousand yards below, fishy things drift by with anvil heads and eel tails and probing tentacles. The fronds of pale feathered river plants fumble over each other as far as Sal can see. Suddenly she recognizes them \u2014 arms, countless human arms in their final frantic moments.\nNature didn\u2019t make the Narrows. Something monstrous did. Time plunged into the world and broke the maidenhead of reality.\nMadness opens its maw to swallow her. She fights back, flailing life into her limbs.\nShe kicks hard at the bank. Breaks the surface. Sucks one lungful of air. A chunk of ice bashes her shoulder and puts out the light in her arm. She kicks again. Flings her good arm. Snags a thick root.\nSal makes a fist. Her wrist catches, yanks her shoulder from its socket, but she holds firm. With one dead arm she drags herself up the root, the bank, the trunk, where there is plenty of air, all that she needs.\nHere she gasps and shivers and peers downstream, looking for William. Even with eyes cloudy and streaming, she sees enough to know he\u2019s gone. And she\u2019s on the wrong bank now, a two-mile walk from home instead of one.\nSo she cries. She lies on her back and wails. Juncos burst from the trees, wings beating like applause.\nThe Narrows wants her still. The creek creeps up the bank, mouthing her foot, ready to bite.\nWater fills Sal\u2019s boot and jolts her. She struggles up under soggy coat and dress. The Narrows rages. Out of the water, a tangle of human arms surges after her. Stinking, flailing, fish-belly white, they slap onto Sal and drag. Her body bangs on the rocks. She shrieks and kicks. The hands catch her coat. She squirms out of it, screaming, and runs. Behind her the snaking arms claw the earth. Sal runs for her life and doesn\u2019t look back till she reaches the Two-Pony Bridge.\nThere she falls and sobs and sweats. She shivers too hard to walk straight. Her mind is an empty eggshell, cracked and drained.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t real,\u201d she tells the Narrows. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been.\u201d\nBut her coat is missing and nothing else explains why.\nShe has to get far away from here. She\u2019ll run. She\u2019ll steal into the home cabin, take a blanket, change of clothes. She\u2019ll slip onto a train and ride to Wilmington and ask Lily Mead to take her. She can earn her keep. She can cook and clean. The more she thinks, the sharper the picture becomes. It\u2019s as real as anything she knows.\nShe doesn\u2019t see the men in her field until she breaks the tree line.\nThe riders from before? No. Different. And more of them. These men have rifles and horses, too, but clean hats. Shiny boots. One wears a short coat like a banker. On the man next to him, she recognizes the thick neck and silver star: Sheriff Lee. He paces the field with his thumbs in his belt loops.\nOnly then does Sal notice the cabin is gone. In its blackened brick foundation, only a heap of ash and broken glass remains.\nA deputy walks through the wreckage and strikes a match for his cigarette.\nThe man in the banker coat turns.\nWilliam!\nOlder, somehow, with glasses and mustache, but there\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s him. The cold and ache and weight disappear from Sal\u2019s shoulders. She runs to him.\nThe sheriff sees Sal running and gestures to his men. They cluster between Sal and the cabin.\nBut Sal doesn\u2019t care about the cabin. She arrows for the banker and pitches her arms around his waist.\nThe banker lifts his arms away, uncertain.\nDoesn\u2019t he recognize her? She puts her chin on his chest and gazes into his face. He\u2019s as handsome as ever. Was he always so old, though? Were his eyes always brown?\n\u201cSal,\u201d says Sheriff Lee. He pries at her arms, but she won\u2019t let go.\n\u201cShe\u2019s soaking wet,\u201d says old William, his voice higher than she expected.\n\u201cSarah Jane Carver, where you been?\u201d asks the sheriff. He catches Sal\u2019s wrists and unthreads the banker, who skips away, pulling at his damp clothes. Sal frees an arm and reaches for him again.\n\u201cYou know her, Mister Dufrain?\u201d the sheriff asks.\n\u201cLord, no,\u201d says the banker. \u201cI just set foot in the county this morning.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d says Sal. \u201cYou been here for days and days. How can you lie? I thought I lost you.\u201d\nThe banker snorts and cusses.\nSheriff Lee thinks on this. \u201cLost him where?\u201d\n\u201cIn the Narrows,\u201d says Sal.\nThe sheriff and the banker exchange glances. Sal reaches for old William again, but he recoils.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you want me?\u201d she asks. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\nShe finally looks around her. At the edge of the cornfield, the last shroud of snow sparkles with red. William brought her one last treasure.\n\u201cWilliam,\u201d she says. She spins and breaks out of the sheriff\u2019s grip. \u201cThey\u2019re beautiful.\u201d\nBewildered, the men watch Sal run to the crest of snow and scoop spattered red in her hands.\n\u201cRubies,\u201d says Sal. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nBut they smear to rouge. They can\u2019t be rubies.\nThe men tighten their circle. Putting a hand on Sal\u2019s shoulder, Sheriff Lee gestures to a deputy, who saddles up with the banker and rides out.\n\u201cWhere are they going?\u201d asks Sal.\n\u201cMister Dufrain\u2019s son is missing,\u201d says the sheriff. His voice is sweet and soft. \u201cWe think you found him.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d says Sal. \u201cOh.\u201d Her eyes fill up. It was too wild a hope.\n\u201cSal, your brother is hurt, and your Ma is missing. Do you know where she is?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll find her.\u201d\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d says Sal.\nHer words hang in the air. Sheriff Lee studies her swollen face, her torn clothes, her cracked and bleeding hands.\n\u201cWhat happened, Sal?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me go back to her, sheriff. I\u2019d rather drown in the Narrows.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nGeorge Carver recovers. Bedside, Sheriff Lee takes down George\u2019s account of the robbery, the struggle, the fire, the two armed men on horseback who refused to believe there was no more gold. The sheriff wires their descriptions to every county in the state, but the men don\u2019t turn up.\nThe gunshot wounds leave George a dimpled belly and a stiff leg, but he\u2019s able enough to pick fruit at Chester Farm by spring.\nSal asks to go to Wilmington. There\u2019s nowhere else to send her, so arrangements are made. Mr. Dufrain volunteers to pay for Sal\u2019s train. He asks the sheriff to pass on his sympathy and thanks, but he declines to see her again.\nMoved with compassion, Lily Walter n\u00e9e Mead gladly takes Sal in. The Walters\u2019 kindness expands their reputation. Under their gabled roof, Sal cooks and crochets and secures a gentle future.\nShe grows two inches that summer, to everyone\u2019s surprise.\nNo one rattles the windows in Lily\u2019s house.\nWilmington winters are milder. Sal slips out of her new lovely lamplit home and goes walking to the water, walking until her feet are numb and her lips are lavender.\nShe wonders if anything lives in Cowpen Branch or Tony\u2019s Creek.\nThe Thing in the Narrows is always calling. It whispers to her in Ma\u2019s voice.\nCome back, it says. Let me hold you again.\nShe shakes her head and tries to live like the others do, one morning at a time, one step away from deep waters.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue24\/3lbe24_story5.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"Sal doesn't plan to find the body.

She doesn\u2019t look at his name tag when she acknowledges his name, so even though she says Hi Nuu in a perfectly even tone, she never takes her eyes off her screen so he knows, he just knows that she\u2019s saying \u0db1\u0dd6 instead of \u0dab\u0dd6, that this is what she is imagining in her mind\u2019s eye, to the extent that she is imagining him at all \u2014 she must imagine him to acknowledge him, surely, as something more than a blur at the corner of her eye, the warmth of another sweating human in the overloaded air-conditioning \u2014 that she is imagining him with this far more common letter of the well-trodden alphabet rather than his exotic sporting hornet from the ass-end of the alphabet that nobody ever goes to; that she\u2019s imagining this other letter that sounds exactly the same as the one assigned to him but looks different: that she\u2019s thinking of something simpler and less interesting than his actual letter, which is a ghost letter of no phonemic consequence, the vestigial memory of an ancient distinction in pronunciation that people long since gave up on. His name is the letter that begins the word debt and the letter he knows her to be using is the one that begins the word modernity. The gap between his newly-molted self and her perception immediately begins to chafe at him. He finds himself turning toward her, tilting so that his chest is visible, willing her to look in his direction and see the name tag and somehow indefinably adjust her perception of him so that she calls him Nuu and not Nuu \u2014 a difference that he is certain that he would perceive, not from a difference of pronunciation since after all they sound identical, but from the subtle changes in the movements of her face, in much the same way that an ancestor might have sensed the invisible movement of a tiger in the undergrowth through a generalized situational awareness, a growing unease, something not quite right about the way leaves shiver in the wind over there, something just a little hair-raising about the jungle\u2019s musk. But \u01e2\u2019s neck is stiff and she does not turn. In their brief time together, she will never actually look at him.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cYou speak English and know how to use a computer,\u201d his father\u2019s ghost said, identifying these as the sine qua non and perhaps also the ne plus ultra of qualification for temporary employment. So Nuu dialed his father\u2019s old office number, which he knew by heart from childhood, and held up the receiver for his father\u2019s ghost to speak to the new Chairman, his successor. He held that conversation at arm\u2019s length, head turned aside, because he didn\u2019t want to know if his father\u2019s ghost would try to make him seem a meritorious candidate with undeserved praise \u2014 this seemed unlikely \u2014 or invoke pity for his uselessness and call upon the camaraderie of deep state bureaucracy in wartime, perhaps even the special bond between chairmen that transcends death, and either way, listening in on that would only be humiliating.\nEven with his father\u2019s machinations, the job still took a few months to become available. During that time Nuu worked at a series of other temporary jobs, each more ephemeral than the last. In his spare time he did his best to become a social media influencer but failed, which also made it a relief to give up his old identity when the offer from the Office finally came.\nThe delay between the chairmen\u2019s agreement and the eventual offer was mysterious to Nuu at first, but now he thinks the Office was waiting for the previous Nuu to become missing so that they could recycle the name tag. Surely, he reasons, there can only be as many people in the O-PYTBM as the alphabet can support with the single-letter name tags that everybody around him seems to have. Including all the elu and misra characters in the alphabet, each of which can be modified with a range of diacritics, that means a total staff strength of a little over a thousand, which sounds about right because this is a four-story building full of people with name tags. The building is even fuller, of course, of the thousands of civilians without name tags here to file complaints, open cases, and make freedom of information requests.\nAt all hours of the working day, civilians stream past his workstation, singly and in packs and in queues, attempting to follow a process not intentionally designed to be labyrinthine, confusing, and frustrating, as far as Nuu can tell, but one that coincidentally arrives at that situation through factors other than intention, as an emergent property of distributed causes such as the great unwillingness on the part of any name tag wearer to expend more energy than is required to live. Nuu feels that unwillingness settle on his shoulders on his very first day. It weighs him down. Apart from trying to position himself at a slight angle so that \u01e2 could see his name tag (if only she would turn and look in his direction even once) he only moves when absolutely required.\nWhen civilians attempt to speak to him, he directs them randomly to other staff members. Since all staff code names are derived from the alphabet, he knows everybody\u2019s names without knowing who they are or their function. Ah, he says to some, please see \u0da4 with your paperwork; to others he suggests that they should speak to \u0d8e or \u0db6\u0dde. He is only careful to pick names that he doesn\u2019t see in his immediate vicinity. He worries at first that someone will find him out and complain, perhaps these hypothetical colleagues at whom he is redirecting traffic since they must surely resent the intrusion, but as the day wears on and nothing happens, he comes to believe that perhaps the entire O-PYTBM is doing what he\u2019s doing and therefore that his behavior is legitimized through universality. Or else, and just as likely, he argues to himself, that he is contributing a necessary and innovative degree of chaos to the process, imparting it with some randomized kinetic energy so as to agitate the Brownian motion of particular civilians through the chambers of the bureaucracy, and that the system must to some degree need him to do what he\u2019s doing, perhaps even rely on him to prevent itself from becoming stale and moribund.\n\u201cI am a breath of fresh air in this place,\u201d he says to \u01e2, who laughs and asks him how his interview with the Chairman went.\nNuu hesitates. \u201cIt was fine,\u201d he says. It\u2019s too complicated to explain why he didn\u2019t have one, he thinks. Or too embarrassing, at least.\n\u01e2 talks about her own interview a little. She transferred in from another government office at a similar grade but the Chairman insisted on an interview on principle. She says that the one-on-one with the Chairman is a harrowing experience. Everybody in the office has one of those stories, she says. It\u2019s a rite of passage. Nuu suspects she thinks that he\u2019s dealing with the trauma of his own interview by downplaying its horror, and is trying to get him to open up. This impression pleases him: he resolves to maintain it. I could be the strong and silent type, he thinks.\n\u201cDid the Chairman ask you about the law?\u201d \u01e2 asks. \u201cHe\u2019s very into it, I thought. Letter and spirit.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Nuu says, and then, realizing that he\u2019s made an error, perhaps fallen into a trap, he amends awkwardly: \u201cYes, a little.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t had your interview yet, have you,\u201d \u01e2 says.\nNuu doesn\u2019t answer this. He\u2019s still trying to figure out how to respond when \u01e2 continues.\n\u201cYou should bone up on the legal instruments that enable what we do here,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a list. The Chairman will want to talk to you eventually, and trust me, it\u2019ll come up.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAnyway, the real problem, he thinks, the problem that probably even overrides the other problem, is that the Office cannot cope with the volume of data. There are far too many people who are yet to become missing: they utterly dwarf the small population of the already lost, those who were disappeared, those who were abducted, those who were arrested and vanished into secret prisons or unmarked mass graves, those who surrendered and were shot under a flag of truce, those whose bodies were burned in mass pyres to destroy the evidence, those who were taken from their homes or from the street and became lost, or sometimes even found, in parts. Those who are yet to be missing, meanwhile, are not any of those things. Those who are yet to be missing are alive, not lost, and whole except for their hearts, which beat too fast and shed muscle mass so quickly that the chamber walls become thin, making it hard to sleep through the tachycardia, the beat fast and pattering like the tramping footsteps of a mob in the night rushing from door to door, getting ever closer to yours. Those who are yet to be missing number in the millions, and that\u2019s the problem with the process. That, and the necessity for civilians to file all their requests in the future tense, the delicate navigation of the subjunctive that so few of them have mastered \u2014 If I and\/or those that I love were to become missing, a civilian would have to say as preamble to most requests, and so few of them could even articulate this grammatical construction correctly. That\u2019s also a problem, and maybe that\u2019s the actual for-real real problem, he thinks, if one considers that failure at the point of the public\u2019s interface with the process is more fundamental than flaws internal to the process itself. How can something that starts so badly end well?\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cI\u2019ve never worked in The Private Sector,\u201d \u01e2 says. She says it like that, with capital letters.\nThat afternoon, the staff of the third floor, including Nuu and \u01e2, are summoned for a morale-boosting workshop with a productivity consultant. The consultant is a large man in a long-sleeved shirt and tie, attire deeply unsuited to this office with its failing air-conditioning. The consultant is flushed, sweating, and breathing hard, as if on the cusp of fainting from heatstroke. He gathers the staff into an open area and forms them into a circle. Inside the circle stands the gasping consultant and his whiteboard. He starts drawing logic puzzles on it. The staff\u2019s solutions to the logic puzzles are meant to represent something about creative thinking which will be generically useful to their productivity in some fashion. There is a box, the consultant says, and it is important to be outside it. Civilians mill around outside the circle of employees, trying to peer inside. Nobody has explained to the civilians that the workflow of the office has been interrupted for this workshop, so the outside of the circle of employees is a roiling susurration of queries and requests for assistance, and sly attempts to file paperwork by thrusting it into hands and pockets.\nNuu has been to nearly identical workshops twice before in corporate jobs \u2014 they were performed by different consultants, but it seems they\u2019re all reading the same books, because the puzzles are familiar. Or at least, he remembers the answers to the puzzles without understanding or remembering the logic of how those answers were arrived at. He starts whispering the correct answers to \u01e2, who becomes the only person in the circle to answer the consultant\u2019s puzzles at all. The sweating consultant seems confused by this, as if he wasn\u2019t actually expecting audience engagement and is unsure what to do with getting responses at all, much less a string of rapid-fire answers all correctly and neatly as far out of the box as desired.\n\u201cYou wanted to know what The Private Sector was like,\u201d Nuu whispers to \u01e2.\n\u201cI hear we\u2019re going to be made a public-private partnership next year,\u201d \u01e2 whispers back. She\u2019s kept her eyes on the consultant the entire time. \u201cIf that happens I\u2019m putting in for a transfer to the Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms. I hear it\u2019s not as bad there.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be here long enough to have to deal with that,\u201d Nuu says, and then clamps his mouth shut. He doesn\u2019t want to keep reminding her, or himself, of his employment\u2019s mortality. But it seems he can\u2019t stop thinking about it. His time here is short, and it makes him feel reckless \u2014 like he could run out into the middle of the circle and pull the consultant\u2019s tie into a noose. He wonders if \u01e2 is flirting. Later he\u2019ll find a brief moment to regret this last interaction even more: the bloodlessness, the banality, the regrettability, the regrets.\nSomeone is nudging him in the side. At first he imagines that it\u2019s civilians attempting to attract his attention, so he ignores it, but the nudging is insistent, and when he looks he sees a short woman wearing a name tag. She\u2019s saying something he doesn\u2019t hear but her tag says \u0da4 and he remembers that this \u00d1a is one of the people he randomly chose to send civilians to in the previous few days. Oh no, she actually came looking for me, he thinks. But then she repeats herself and this time he hears her.\n\u201cYou\u2019re Nuu, aren\u2019t you? \u2014 The new one? \u2014 The Chairman wants to speak to you immediately.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe Chairman himself is large and intimidating behind a large and intimidating table untidily piled with awards and paperwork, an ex-military man who insists on his former rank when introducing himself \u2014 Nuu doesn\u2019t catch the rank or name and then it\u2019s awkward to ask, and the Chairman doesn\u2019t wear a name tag \u2014 even though it is currently superseded by his chairmanship. Nuu keeps thinking the man said bombardier which is clearly and absolutely wrong since it sounds weirdly archaic and is probably not even a real rank in the contemporary military, and anyway it sounds not fancy enough for the Chairman, who surely would not cling to a rank that wasn\u2019t far more senior and distinguished. But Nuu is thinking of artillery, which is all he can think about for a long moment after the Chairman\u2019s self-introduction, about shells coming down among civilians cramped into safe zones, upon refugees trapped in encampments, onto hospitals full of the already-dying, the explosions drowning out whatever the bombardier \u2014 the Chairman \u2014 is saying.\nTo stop thinking about these things Nuu thinks of bombardier beetles with their cannon-bodies and hot toxic chemicals fired in ferocious pulses from the tips of their abdomens. The moment he thinks this thought he knows it\u2019s too late to unthink it because his traitor eyes can now only see the Chairman, the bombardier, as a giant beetle. A beetle-browed beetle, brown and black. The enormous table has no modesty panel: he can see, and more than see, he can dimly sense with a kind of animal panic, the seated Chairman\u2019s legs in a wide stance like spread elytra; the crotch whose slumping thrust is like a loaded gun beneath the table, like a beetle\u2019s abdomen with firing glands curved down and forward, pointed in his direction. There is only one seat in front of the table, directly in the line of fire. Nuu sits in it, very slowly, and tries to focus on the view above the table rather than below. The Chairman is still talking, antennae slowly waving, though it seems Nuu\u2019s now missed quite a speech. He tunes in just as he realizes this speech is not actually about the Office or Nuu\u2019s employment, or at least not yet. The Chairman is reminiscing about the former Chairman, Nuu\u2019s father.\n\u201cThat was when we were in university together,\u201d the Chairman continues. \u201cOf course that was when there was only one university in this country and we took education seriously, and the duties and obligations that it placed upon us, not like those yakos outside.\u201d He pauses here to compose a glare at Nuu, one sufficiently layered that Nuu is given to understand that he too is being assessed as yako-adjacent at best, despite his temporary exemption from this category. The Chairman\u2019s affect is one of deeply hostile avuncularity. \u201cI know you understand this despite your father\u2019s relationship with this Office: you have no place here. Do you understand this?\u201d\nNuu nods, and then since the Chairman seems to require a verbal acknowledgement, repeats that he understands this.\n\u201cI want to be very clear about this,\u201d the Chairman says, \u201cWith no possible room for misunderstanding since we live in an age defined by the entitlement of the young, especially with regard to the role of the government in providing them with jobs. You do not currently have a government job. You are not a permanent employee. You will not age gracefully. You will not receive a pension. Nor is your current temporary employment going to lead to any of those things. You are grist for the precariat and soon will return to it. Is that clear?\u201d\nNuu agrees that this is clear.\nThe Chairman seems to mellow a little. \u201cTell me about your father,\u201d he says. \u201cHow did he die?\u201d\n\u201cA stroke,\u201d says Nuu.\n\u201cLightning,\u201d the Chairman says, his jaw tightening in anger, which Nuu sees as a furious twitch of the forelegs and a tension in the antennae.\n\u201cNo, I mean\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNature abhors a Chairman,\u201d the Chairman says. \u201cYour father knew this well. He understood our struggle. It pains me that you do not.\u201d\nVery, very slowly, the Chairman\u2019s translucent underwings slip out from his elytra and become cruciform and erect, catching all the sunlight from the windows. They are huge rainbow membranes in the light and Nuu squints so as to not look at them.\n\u201c\u2018No person shall propagate war,\u2019\u201d the Chairman says. \u201cThat\u2019s from Act 56 of 2007, one of this Office\u2019s foundational legislative instruments, which you should know by heart. Tell me, son. Have you ever propagated war? Have you propagated propaganda? Have you any sense of the proper shape of things? Did you speak to any of those protestors outside on your way in?\u201d\nNuu shakes his head, hesitates, then shakes his head again, knowing all too well this makes him look guilty for no reason.\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean those protestors,\u201d the Chairman says. \u201cNot the students demanding jobs. I mean the civilians protesting about their lost loved ones. Small group to the east of the door. Obviously they are not even protesting the correct office, since we don\u2019t deal with the missing.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even see them,\u201d Nuu says. He is confused by the Chairman\u2019s use of cardinal directions instead of relative ones. Which way is east? The sun is in his eyes, filtered through the delicate membranes of the Chairman\u2019s wings, so he\u2019s facing west, but he has no idea of the angle between him and the door into the building four floors below. This encounter with the Chairman \u2014 which at first he had assumed was a belated interview \u2014 has at some point become an interrogation, he thinks, though he can\u2019t fathom to what end. He wonders if the Chairman is perhaps just fucking with him. All that unhealthy reminiscence about his father, the avuncularity gone sour. Is this still what \u01e2 was warning him about, or has it sunk to a deeper level, something more dangerous? He risks a glance under the table, where at this angle he can only see the clawed tips of Chairman\u2019s hindmost legs, which are still splayed wide apart. The firing glands below the table are an awful presence. They seem to emanate a great heat, distorting the air in the room. The Chairman\u2019s face seems to swim in the heat, mandibles slowly working. Nuu doesn\u2019t dare move his chair or cross his legs. His belly feels very vulnerable, its muscles knotted tight.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that they are hard to see, the friends and family of the disappeared,\u201d the Chairman says, ponderously. \u201cVery true. I\u2019d blame the crowd, but really it\u2019s their own fault for being so few in number and so lost to this world that they are almost themselves missing.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Nuu says, misreading what he thinks is a cue. \u201cThen we should have records\u2014\u201d But this is a mistake. The Chairman\u2019s antennae go stiff.\n\u201cRecords,\u201d the Chairman says. \u201cWe don\u2019t simply have records. Records are emergent. Records are immanent. Records arise from demand, from need, like maggots from meat. Tell me, do you think you just propagated war? I feel like you did, a little.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Nuu says. He tries to say this firmly, as if conviction alone could keep him unconvicted. He can\u2019t see the tip of the bombardier\u2019s abdomen below the table, but he knows it is precisely aimed at his lower belly, which is already aching from the tension. He wonders how hot the chemical spray will be. Clouds of scalding steam and jets of boiling, toxic liquid in pulses like hard jabs, burning through his clothes, his skin, his muscles, his organs, his unhardened bones, his sweet marrow, his uncooked ideologies, his inchoate, indeterminate, unbegun life.\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d the Chairman asks. The bombardier leans forward: front legs on the table, middle legs braced to the sides, body bent almost in half with both ends pointing in Nuu\u2019s direction over and under the table. \u201cAre you sure you haven\u2019t propagated war a little? Come on, you can tell me. Everybody propagates war a little. It\u2019s perfectly normal to propagate war. Are you telling me you\u2019ve never ever?\u201d","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue32\/3lbe32_story3.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"The first thing they do when he starts working at the Office on Persons Yet To Be Missing is to give him the code name Nuu and to tell him to forget who he was before.

Bennardo","hostname":"3lobedmag.com","date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000","categories":"","tags":"","id":null,"license":null,"comments":null,"text":"There had been a pamphlet of Defoe\u2019s Conjugal Lewdness, which had sadly turned out to be an almost entirely decayed sheaf of unconnected pages. But the real prizes had always been the worm-eaten and half-disintegrated 18th century reprints of Gesner\u2019s Historiae animalium and Vesalius\u2019s De humani corporis frabrica. The several dozen leaves that he\u2019d saved from those two volumes and their inimitable illustrations now resided in a handsomely bound new volume of his own arranging, along with pages from a similarly distressed Culpeper\u2019s Compleat Herbal, acquired separately.\nThe fourth book in the lot he had taken to be something in Dutch from the same period. He didn\u2019t recognize the title or author, or really even the language \u2014 he\u2019d simply guessed Dutch after scanning the title page and flipping through a few of the leaves. The illustrations were crude diagrams and symbols, all of which were too abstract to be of interest. They were nothing like the etchings culled from Gesner\u2019s bestiary, Vesalius\u2019s anatomy, or Culpeper\u2019s mad astrological compilation of herbal remedies.\nSo the book in Dutch had been stuck into a bookshelf with an appropriately sized gap, and had stayed there for twenty years until Lynd found himself forced to evacuate his comfortable home under orders from the divorce court. His life had, of course, ceased to be perfectly comfortable some time before, when his wife (now almost ex-wife) had first filed suit against him. But the home had remained comfortable enough, in no small part thanks to the walls of books which filled his library.\nBut that was all right. If he were forced to leave, then he would take the books with him to his new home, and it would be that de-volumed house \u2014 not himself \u2014 which would be impoverished by the separation. He was almost grateful for the excuse to comprehensively ransack his own bookshelves. Already he was finding hidden treasures he\u2019d long since forgotten about, like this Dutch book \u2014 neglected for decades, sitting and waiting for him between De Quincey\u2019s On Murder as Considered as One of the Fine Arts and Blades\u2019s Enemies of Books, ready now perhaps to give up the charms that he failed to penetrate as a young bachelor twenty years earlier.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBut the books were the important thing. There had been boxes and boxes of those, and the bookshelves they belonged on. Most of that was crammed into the storage space Lynd had rented, except for the final few boxes which he had left in his car. He supposed he\u2019d be able to read as much as he liked now without interruption, but that was a Pyrrhic victory, won at the cost of his pride and much of his comfort. Between the books and the house, he preferred the books. But he would have liked to have kept both.\nSighing, Lynd picked up the Dutch book from the motel nightstand. He wasn\u2019t entirely sure why he\u2019d kept it out, as books written in languages he didn\u2019t understand rarely made good bedtime reading. But Lynd was curious about it. The other three books it had come with \u2014 though badly beaten up \u2014 had all proved valuable and stimulating in their own ways. Surely this was worth a closer look than he\u2019d originally given it.\nThe book was in better shape than he remembered. It appeared to be missing great chunks of pages \u2014 big sections had clearly fallen out and become lost \u2014 but the binding was otherwise still fundamentally sound. It had a light blue cloth and cardboard cover with no legible markings on the outside, but that was hardly unusual.\nUpon opening the book, Lynd suddenly remembered the title page and why he hadn\u2019t examined the book more closely two decades ago. He didn\u2019t think of himself as particularly religious or superstitious, but somehow he had always been squeamish around the occult. It wasn\u2019t so much that he thought there was anything to it \u2014 but rather that the whole pursuit struck him as sinister and unpleasant. He didn\u2019t like being reminded of the willful depravity and ignorance of man.\nThe title page bore a prominent pentagram decoration, and lest Lynd think it was merely a matter of Kipling and his innocent mystical swastikas, a goat\u2019s head had been superimposed upon it. Around the border of the page were other glyphs which looked equally ominous. Lynd couldn\u2019t exactly identify any of them, but any symbol might take on a black character when viewed in proximity to the pentagram.\nThere was also the title, of course, but Lynd could make nothing of it. The letters were Roman, but they didn\u2019t appear to conform to any language he knew, and certainly not Dutch. He wondered if it were some private cipher or some ceremonial language, like the Church Slavonic of the Greek Orthodox rites. Or perhaps the book had been intentionally printed with gibberish, some kind of pagan lorem ipsum meant to intimidate or impress with the appearance of forbidden knowledge.\nThe next page contained nothing but a large, complicated design. It appeared to be one long looping, criss-crossed line that ended in two loose ends, hanging out the top and bottom of the design. Lynd applied his finger to one of these loose ends and traced his way through every loop. He\u2019d been right. It was an unbroken line. Then turning the page, he looked down and read the words:\nPart the First:\nThe Establishment of Melancholy\nLynd blinked. The page he was looking at was now as indecipherable as ever, but he was certain that he had read and understood the heading. Still, when he looked at it again, it was clearly gibberish. Then, gradually, as he stared at the letters on the page, the words seemed to make sense once more.\nIt was astounding. But as soon as Lynd began to grasp what was happening, the words disappeared and the gibberish returned. It was only when his mind wandered \u2014 when he viewed the printing out of the periphery of his mind, as it were, that anything seemed to make sense. Lynd let his mind wander away again, and when the words took on their secret shapes, he read on:\nThere was considerably more, all in the same vein, and Lynd found the reading relatively easy once he had the trick. He was so enamored of the shifting letters that he barely paid attention to what he was reading. Instead, he simply turned the pages to watch the next line of words pull together and make some semblance of sense (at least actual words, if not sensible thoughts) while he read.\nIt was with something of a shock then that he became aware of movement around him. First, he was simply aware that somebody was moving outside the window, just beyond the door \u2014 which, of course, was locked. So it was with a surge of near panic that he realized the door was now opening and somebody was in the room with him. The light had seemed to dim, the book had fallen away from his hands, and he lay in bed frozen and unable to move. Closer came the intruder, and Lynd could just make out a shadow bobbing along the periphery of his vision \u2014 and then two shadows. They seemed to talk, but Lynd couldn\u2019t hear anything more than a faint buzzing sound. He grew more and more perplexed.\nThen, with a jolt, he awoke.\nHis heart beat quickly for a moment, but soon cooled. It had been a brief episode of sleep paralysis \u2014 that was all. It was that half-waking, half-sleeping state in which the eyes are open, the brain is dreaming, and the body is fixed in the immobility of sleep. It had probably been brought on by falling asleep with the light on in the midst of reading \u2014 Lynd snorted at the idea, reading! \u2014 that Dutch book. Flipping through it again, he saw that the pages were completely indecipherable. No doubt he had dreamed that there had ever been any real words.\nLynd stood and put the Dutch book back on the shelf where it belonged, between the Blades and the De Quincey. Shutting off the light, he crawled back into bed \u2014 the deliciously empty bed with its cool, crisp sheets \u2014 and quickly fell asleep.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIt was as if Lynd was discovering for the first time how little he actually owned, but he didn\u2019t care. He had his books, and his favorite chair, and the bed, and the whole house. He would be perfectly comfortable thus.\nThe book stayed on its shelf during the weeks that followed, and then the months. They weren\u2019t uniformly calm months, as Lynd would have preferred. It seemed eventually that his wife \u2014 now ex-wife \u2014 had felt there was some inequity in the division of their property. She seemed to think, and she seemed to grow more and more convinced each day, that she ought to have gotten the house. Or, if not the house, then some bigger share of the savings and a larger alimony check.\nLynd couldn\u2019t understand where all of this was coming from, so long after the divorce had been agreed upon. He did admit to himself, a little queasily, that it looked a lot like she had gotten the short end of the settlement. He remembered thinking that it had seemed fair at the time, or perhaps even a little unfair to him. But on reviewing the terms again at the remove of these months, Lynd couldn\u2019t help but think that she had a point.\nLynd\u2019s lawyer, of course, advised him to say nothing of that to anybody. The divorce was done and the papers were all in order. His ex-wife might have made some bad choices at the time or might have gotten some bad counsel, but that didn\u2019t mean she necessarily had any standing to demand anything else. Lynd\u2019s lawyer advised him simply to weather the storm in the hopes that she would lose interest or that her lawyer would encourage her to drop the matter. But Lynd kept having the queasy feeling.\nIt was while dusting his bookshelves during a worried, sleepless night that he came across the Dutch book again. He couldn\u2019t say why, but it instantly intrigued him. He remembered, perhaps, the strange dream he\u2019d had months earlier in which he somehow thought he\u2019d read and understood the book. In any event, he was curious to see it again and he wanted something to take his mind off the problem of his ex-wife, so in a moment it was in his hand and he was draped over the couch.\nThe unpleasant occultism of the title page made him flip rapidly past it, after confirming that none of the words looked the least bit like any language he knew. He flipped also past the intricate symbol on the next page, and his eyes came to rest on the heading that started the book proper. He read:\nXctilch Vlitrul\nDsi Tirch Qvesti Nyr ast Opvrivius Ginst ulcx Prepor\nFlipping through the rest of the book, it was more of the same \u2014 sheer gibberish. Lynd was more certain than ever that it was a clever hoax and that he held in his hands some pseudo-diabolical artifact of the Enlightenment, meant to separate some gullible aristocrat with occult interests from his money. But he found his attention arrested midway through the book at another intricate design \u2014 this one composed of interlocking diamonds and triangles tessellated across the full page. Almost by impulse, he traced this design with his finger to see if it too was composed of a single, unbroken line. It was. Flipping to the next page, he read:\nPart the Second:\nThe Emancipation of Man From Melancholy\nThe letters shifted before his eyes in precisely the same way that he remembered from the dream. He stopped to see if he was awake, and he satisfied himself thoroughly that he was. He held his breath, and tugged at the hairs on his arms, and counted the freckles on his wrist, and cracked his knuckles \u2014 all of this, until the accumulation of concrete details made him certain that he was wide awake.\nWith that, he once more dove back into the book. Even as he read, his mind all the time was working. He tried to reconstruct the scene of his first encounter with the book. It was clear now that it had been no dream, and yet it had seemed to happen someplace else. But why would he ever have taken this book anywhere else? If he hadn\u2019t fallen asleep in his chair or in his bed, then where? Perhaps he had dreamed part of it, but not all of it. Perhaps he had started awake, and ended up asleep, and who could say where the curtain of unconsciousness had fallen?\nWith thoughts such as these in his mind, it was with some uneasiness that Lynd began to realize he may have fallen asleep again. He hadn\u2019t seen or heard anything, but he found he couldn\u2019t speak. He opened his mouth, and only a faint bleating came out. Panic seemed to mount inside of him as he tried again and again. If anything were to come at this moment \u2014 if anything were to attack him \u2014 he would be defenseless, not even able to shout out. Was that a shadow at the periphery of his vision?\nThen suddenly, he awoke.\nShaking his head, he put the Dutch book aside on an end table and went to his bedroom. Twice, he had fallen asleep looking at the ridiculous thing. Twice, he had had the same impossible dream, and twice he had woken in a near panic. If anything, the book was a soporific and a poison to his dreams, and that was all.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cHave you heard from them?\u201d asked the voice on the phone \u2014 rough and desperate, a woman\u2019s.\n\u201cWho?\u201d asked Lynd.\n\u201cYour wife,\u201d said the voice. \u201cYour children.\u201d\n\u201cI have no wife,\u201d said Lynd.\n\u201cYour ex-wife,\u201d hissed the voice. \u201cHave you seen her?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been married,\u201d said Lynd. \u201cGood bye.\u201d He hung up. A moment later, the phone rang again, and he was suddenly filled with fear. He reached out and unplugged the phone.\nThe book stayed on the end table even longer. It stayed past the point when Lynd began to feel harassed. The woman, whoever she was, would not leave him alone. She claimed to be the mother of a missing woman and grandmother of two missing children. More to the point, she claimed to have been Lynd\u2019s mother-in-law.\nShe called, she came to the house, and as time went by she only grew more insistent. Lynd found out what he could about her. Her husband had passed away years ago, or he would have appealed to him. But Lynd could find no record that the couple had ever had a daughter, or any child at all, to go missing in the first place. And the woman could produce no evidence of her own \u2014 no birth certificate, no photographs, no school records, no baby teeth. It was as if she had created her daughter out of thin air, and had somehow decided to marry her off to Lynd \u2014 though as far as he knew, he had never seen the woman before.\nIt was only after weeks of escalating intrusions that Lynd finally felt he had no choice but to call the police. He knew, inevitably, where it would lead, and he felt bad about it. But the woman had no family to intervene, no one who could get her the help he needed. And it certainly wasn\u2019t Lynd\u2019s responsibility to get that help. She had picked him somehow, seemingly out of a hat, and he merely wanted to return to his former life of peace and quiet.\nOf course he had to testify. He had thought about asking the court to show some mercy, but he realized that as soon as she was on the street again, she would be pounding on his door. She had made that clear during the hearings, and her delusion seemed not to have abated a bit. Lynd consulted a psychologist and she had agreed that, given the circumstances, a home might be the best place for her.\nThe book stayed on the end table until Lynd picked it up in a fit of distraction and starting flipping through the pages. He very nearly put it down after a moment, but then it fell open on a new page, with a new design. This one was the most complicated yet, a quadruple row of intersecting filigrees, but again Lynd\u2019s finger impulsively traced all the way through. And he was hardly surprised when turning the page, he read:\nPart the Third:\nThe Elimination of Man From Melancholy\nThough hardly surprised, Lynd found himself somehow unaccountably dismayed. He instantly shut the book, refusing to read more. His heart was beating and his blood roared in his temples. Somehow, he had a fear of that page, deep in his gut, and that fear had stopped him. In fact, there was something in him that already feared he had read too much, that he had already made a fatal mistake \u2014 though he couldn\u2019t imagine why.\nLynd stood shakily and replaced the Dutch book back in the gap in the shelf where it had always sat. Casting about for something else to occupy his mind with, he took down the French original of de Longeville\u2019s Histoire des personnes qui ont vecu plusieurs siecles. Lynd had never been a very good student of language, but he had tried particularly hard to learn French, with some success.\nUnfortunately, the book proved to be exactly the wrong one for the situation. Lynd\u2019s mind, already in disorder, struggled to untangle the French vocabulary and syntax, and before long his thoughts had wandered away entirely. It was with a start that he realized he was no longer reading de Longeville\u2019s fantastic accounts of century-spanning lives, but that instead the words before his eyes were shifting into new text in the same way that the words in the Dutch book had. It seemed the book was telling him to rip out melancholy at the source, with the only solution that could be guaranteed to be foolproof and effective. With a start, Lynd shut the book and threw it violently away.\nBut what was he afraid of? The Dutch book was strange, of course, but why should it be anything to be frightened of? He had read it twice before, with no apparent ill effects except that it had put him to sleep. It was true that the book was connected in his mind with strange happenings afterward \u2014 the latest of which was the appearance of this mad woman in his life. Before that \u2014 Lynd couldn\u2019t quite remember what anxiety he had supposed the book to have caused, but it seemed to him that it also had something to do with accusations of marriage\u2026\nLynd shook his head to clear it. He was overwrought, and he was letting his imagination run away with him at any rate.\nAt once Lynd sprang up and drew the book out of its shelf. He regarded it suspiciously. It looked ordinary enough and, of course, it might be valuable\u2026 Perhaps it was better to leave it be. But no! He might as well get rid of the damned thing. He couldn\u2019t read it anyway \u2014 not really, despite those unpleasant dreams. No, the best thing was simply to get rid of it.\nLynd had never burned a book before, but he remembered hearing that it was necessary to fan the pages out, to allow air to circulate. Otherwise the paper would never catch \u2014 not without some kind of accelerant. But of course \u2014 he had lighter fluid. He laid the book out on the fireplace grate, its pages fanned out as well as he could manage. Lynd stuffed balled up newspapers under and around the book, and even between the open pages to help prop them open.\nThen he paused and considered again what he was about to do. He looked at the book, almost sympathetically. It seemed monstrous to burn any book \u2014 even one that was full of blasphemous gibberish and one that seemed to work him into a state of unhealthy excitement every time he picked it up. But then his eyes fell across the corner of a page, and he saw the letters begin to crawl and change and his mind was made up. He squirted the can of lighter fluid at the book and soaked it liberally in the stuff. Then striking a match, he threw it on the tome and watched the flames erupt in instant conflagration.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBy the time the diabolical letters floated in front of his eyes, it was already too late. Lynd was immobilized by sleep and he could do nothing save watch the letters shift and form themselves into the words of the chapter. Again and again, he strove to scream, but sleep had a tight hold on him and nothing would shake him from its bonds.\nAt long last, after the chapter had spelled itself in front of his eyes, the shadows again appeared at the periphery of his vision. They stole closer, ever closer, to the bed in which he lay and suddenly he saw his face leering down at him in mockery. Next, another shadow rose up out of the dimness \u2014 a woman whom he felt he should have recognized. A moment later, two smaller shadows \u2014 apparently those of children \u2014 appeared next to her with vindictive smiles on their faces.\nStill the book lay in the fireplace, its ashes smoldering and little scraps of paper occasionally flaring up and then receding into powdery white ash. Long the book smoldered, long into the night, and long after Lynd himself was already gone and forgotten \u2014 both he and his melancholy permanently excised from the world of the remembering.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue22\/3lbe22_story5.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"In twenty years, Lynd had never really looked at the book.

The first signs came a year ago, right after Ma died. You remember the hushed voices at the funeral, even Pa, talking about the end of the world and obsessing over the news. All year the TV talked about nothing else and Pa watched with his jaw working and his bottle on his lap.\nPeople shouldn\u2019t panic, the TV said. It would probably be okay, though they didn\u2019t know where everyone would all end up, or even if you would all keep falling and falling until you fell past the formation of the earth itself, or all the way down into the Big Bang.\nThat\u2019s when Pa switched the TV off and started making his own plans.\nWhen the day comes, you and Pa and Jorge are all wearing inflatable life jackets, because Pa says history is mostly water. You\u2019re a cheerful blue and Jorge is bright yellow. You tie yourselves to each other like mountain climbers, and gather your gear.\n\u201cThe important thing is to stay together,\u201d Pa says, and he looks at you. \u201cLook after your brother.\u201d This is because, as Pa has never tired of pointing out, you are ever so slightly older.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need looking after,\u201d Jorge retorts, like he does every time.\nYou grin at him, muss his hair. \u201cBet you.\u201d\nFalling back into time is like having the world tilted. At first it\u2019s just a little pull, in a direction at right angles to everything else. The tugging grows stronger and you realize that your feet are slipping. The day becomes a slope and the slope steepens. It gets hard to stand upright, so you all turn to face the slope and look down.\nThe ground under your feet is slippery like gravel and you\u2019re stretching your arms out for balance \u2014 you try to hold Jorge\u2019s hand but he shakes you off \u2014 when Pa sets off down the slope, slowly and surely, crossing back into yesterday.\n\u201cControl your descent, kids,\u201d Pa shouts back.\nSo you and Jorge start to slip-slide down. Almost immediately, Jorge strikes ahead, pulling away so that the rope goes taut and drags you out of line. You stumble, and Pa looks up. He plants the pick point of his ice axe into about three in the afternoon yesterday, wiggles it to test for firmness. Feet planted, he hauls you and Jorge back to him.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you again,\u201d Pa says. His breath smells. Jorge looks mutinous. You don\u2019t say anything. You\u2019re too busy looking at yesterday. It looks just like you remembered it. You wave to yourself in the corner practicing your knots, but the yourself from yesterday doesn\u2019t see you, because of course you hadn\u2019t seen yourself waving yesterday.\nPa has grumbled that this sort of thing makes his head hurt, so you whisper it to Jorge instead, once Pa pulls his axe loose and moves on.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Jorge says \u201cDon\u2019t you know where he\u2019s taking us?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not taking us anywhere,\u201d you say, confused. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to stay together while we fall.\u201d\nJorge snorts. \u201cBet you.\u201d\nThe first few days are rough. You stumble several times on the day before yesterday. But after a while it becomes easier. Last week is almost comfortable, and by the time you hit last month you\u2019re a little bored. There is so much to look at, but Pa\u2019s dragging you and Jorge faster, as if he\u2019s in a hurry to get it over with.\nYou haven\u2019t seen anybody else falling back into time, though there should be billions and billions of them. Maybe Pa was right about the ropes. Maybe without the ropes, you\u2019d each be falling all alone.\n\u201cHe\u2019s looking for Ma,\u201d Jorge says, while you and he cling to the crest of January for a breather. He nods at Pa, who\u2019s sipping from his flask a rope-length below you. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for when she was still alive.\u201d\n\u201cBut she can\u2019t come with us,\u201d you say. \u201cThey said on TV, that we can\u2019t cross over \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cTime to go, kids,\u201d Pa calls.\n\u201cI tell you, that\u2019s where he\u2019s going and I don\u2019t want to,\u201d Jorge hisses to you. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWe have to stay together,\u201d you hiss back. \u201cPa will figure it out.\u201d\nJorge glares at Pa behind his back. He doesn\u2019t say anything, but you know he doesn\u2019t think Pa is ever going to figure anything out.\nPa sets a faster pace and you have trouble keeping up. Your knees are starting to hurt a little now that you\u2019re doing something halfway between running and falling, feet barely touching the ground any more, wind whistling in your ears. You don\u2019t realize you\u2019ve fallen back a year until you see the people in funeral black in your house.\nPa rushes by the event without pause, and when you glance back you\u2019re pretty sure Jorge had his eyes closed until it was past. You take a good look across the day \u2014 you spot yourself at the funeral, standing in a doorway. It\u2019s the spot you remember hovering in, because it was easier to pretend to be either coming in or going out, depending on who you were trying to get away from.\nYou crane your head as it vanishes upward, trying to see yourself again, but it\u2019s gone and you\u2019ve already learned it\u2019s dangerous to not look where you\u2019re putting your feet.\nWhen you look up you see Jorge\u2019s face and it\u2019s contorted, like it does when he cries, but he\u2019s not crying, just wearing that ugly grimace like it\u2019s frozen on him.\n\u201cHey,\u201d you shout up at him. \u201cDid you realize we\u2019re thirteen now? We just looped the last year.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that,\u201d Jorge snaps.\n\u201cSure it does.\u201d\n\u201cSo another five years down and we can move out,\u201d Jorge shouts back.\nYou stifle a grin. At least that sounds more like Jorge. Past the funeral means that Ma\u2019s long months of illness now stretch down below you, black and gloomy. You\u2019re about to say something back, something \u2014 anything \u2014 to keep Jorge talking, but then the rope yanks you and Jorge right off your feet.\nThe slope is very steep now, almost vertical. Pa jumps, dragging both of you with him. There\u2019s wind in your face and you\u2019re flying and laughing involuntarily, spreading your arms. Jorge glares at you, fumbling with the rope at his waist. The wind gusts and he bounces off the day of Ma\u2019s last biopsy \u2014 you remember it, because that was the day you learned the word \u2014 and it must be painful, because he clutches his knee and lets out a yelp of pain. You hope he didn\u2019t see her again like she was that day. You wonder if he could smell the hospital through the jagged surface of the day.\nThe wind in your ears is loud, but your heart thumps louder.\nPa whoops and digs his pick into the top of a sunny day. It takes, and his fall stops sharp. You and Jorge fall past him instantly \u2014 you must have been two blurs, yellow and blue \u2014 but are almost immediately stopped, painfully jolted by the rope. It slams all the breath out of you and you dangle for a second hoping you haven\u2019t broken a rib. Pa waits until you plant your axe in a nearby morning and hug it tightly. The morning is cold against your cheek. Your teeth chatter.\nPa climbs down carefully to join you.\n\u201cHere we are, kids,\u201d Pa says. He\u2019s looking at himself and Ma on the other side of the day. You tug at his arm, which takes a while for him to notice, but you don\u2019t have the breath to speak yet. You point to the dangling rope.\n\u201cJorge?\u201d Pa says, and there\u2019s a catch in his voice but his eyes keep darting back to himself.\nYou look down, past the frayed absence at the end of the rope, searching for the bright yellow of Jorge\u2019s jacket. There\u2019s nothing but a dwindling flicker far, far below \u2014 he must already be another year down.\nDespite yourself, you look at Ma. You\u2019ve fallen further than you thought: this is before you and Jorge were born. Pa and Ma, on the other side of the day that you\u2019re clinging to, they look so young they\u2019re strangers. You were kidding earlier to Jorge about aging for every year that you\u2019ve fallen, but looking at them makes you feel older.\nPa is saying something. His voice is snot-thick and quavering and you\u2019re not listening because the knots and buckles are difficult to work with the gloves on and the axe in one hand, but you daren\u2019t let go of the axe. Once the rope\u2019s gone, that will be the only way to stop falling.\n\u201cI hope you like it here, Pa,\u201d you say. \u201cI hope it makes you happy.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Pa says, finally noticing the lack of tension on the rope.\nBut you\u2019re already leaping, arms tucked to your sides, eyes fixed on that distant fleck of yellow, falling hard.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue24\/3lbe24_story1.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"About a week after you and Jorge turn twelve, time calves like an iceberg and the world slips down the slope of history.

Alerted to the marshal\u2019s arrival by the house shedu, he stood waiting by the table where he\u2019d been reading, one hand on the logos, the carved, ancient ivory of his fingers taking dull gleam from the early sun. The garden was unruly with summer flowers. A fountain splashed into a stone pool and the murmur and trill of insect and bird life threaded through the air from a small orchard.\nRusk\u2019s maker Ayatta, an inventor of some renown about whom little had been known, had amassed wealth carelessly in recompense for her inventions and kept to herself, a foreigner in a city of foreigners. When she died, she left Rusk everything, the stone townhouse and its steep garden, the house shedu and her other inventions, the rare and treasured logos on which he\u2019d been reading.\nThe marshal, a small woman with silvered hair, dark skin dotted with pale age spots, and light-irised eyes, looked away at Rusk\u2019s word, murder, her mouth tightening. Her formal marshal uniform cut a dark, crisp slash in the haze of morning light.\n\u201cAccording to the law, it\u2019s a disassembling, Rusk. As such I have to treat it.\u201d Luin\u2019s expression begged his understanding \u2014 and because she was only there for his assistance precisely because he would treat it as murder, when she could not, he nodded.\nAyatta had been clever and thorough, and so Rusk occupied a unique position among the farragoes of Acheron city, neither the property of a deviser nor an abandoned artifact without rights. In the two years since Ayatta\u2019s death, the controversy over Rusk\u2019s situation had faded; the oddity of a farrago with the unprecedented privilege afforded by Ayatta\u2019s wealth was now just a part of the city\u2019s character. To some he was a symbol of hope, to others the exception that proved the rule.\nHe knew what people saw when they looked at him. In a city full of varied races and farragoes, he was not so strange: instead of the ivory and bone with which she\u2019d shaped his limbs, Ayatta had sculpted his body, head, and face of ceramics and steel, gloved in alembic-grown skin, soft as velvet.\nAwareness of his nonhuman status never left him.\nRusk gestured to the chairs and table.\nThe house shedu arrived on its leather and rod wings, a small metal-plated lion\u2019s body with the head, arms, and torso of a young man. Setting down a tray holding two cups and a plate of sliced fruit, the shedu departed just as swiftly and silently as it had come.\n\u201cWhat can you tell me?\u201d Rusk asked as he put the plate of fruit by Luin and handed her a cup.\nShe sniffed the tea liquor in the cup and hmmed, eyes closing a moment. \u201cThe farrago\u2019s name was Sirin; he ran an advocacy center for farragoes in the Shoals. He\u2019d gotten up the noses of a few powerful people. But he had respect in the Shoals community.\u201d\nAyatta had threaded carvings in Rusk\u2019s arms, hands, and fingers with sensors. Through them now, Rusk felt the marshal\u2019s perturbation, the sub-dermal twitch of her skin that said she was distressed. She was a moral woman, Luin, as far as she could be; the state of farrago rights troubled her.\nThe Shoals, the farrago district of the city and nominally part of the neighborhood Luin marshaled, were not far, geographically, from where they sat.\nBut a world apart, in other ways.\nLuin nibbled on a slice of yellow persimmon, bright in her dark fingers.\n\u201cThey\u2019re good this year,\u201d she said. She peered toward the grove, a shadowed tangle under the morning sun.\n\u201cWho was Sirin\u2019s deviser?\u201d\n\u201cDroma,\u201d Luin said.\nRusk felt the echo of an old ache. Droma had been the last of the Liberties, of which Ayatta had been a member, the group of devisers, lawmakers, and activists responsible for opening the debate on the status of farragoes as beings with more rights than objects to be owned. Droma had been one of Ayatta\u2019s closer colleagues. In the law\u2019s view, Droma would be the victim of Sirin\u2019s disassembling, but Droma had died some months before Ayatta.\n\u201cThe Devisers College is \u2026 more concerned with other matters than a disassembling when there\u2019s no owner to press for justice,\u201d Luin said.\nRusk kept from snorting and Luin\u2019s lips twisted.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll look into it?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Rusk nodded. It was not the first time Luin had requested his assistance in a matter that involved the farrago district.\nIt was the first time that matter was murder.\nAfter the marshal left, Rusk sat in thought at the table. The old deviser\u2019s journal he had been reading on Ayatta\u2019s logos flickered as it reset to its plain state.\nOn a logos one could call up a particular book or a list of books on a particular subject, and then each volume on the list\u2014Rusk had yet to find the limit in the capacity and range of Ayatta\u2019s \u2014 and the logos became that book. A hand-bound journal, slim hard cover, fat paperback, scroll, manuscript, folio, tablet, weighty tome with buckles and illuminated cover \u2014 a true portable library of actual books. Logosi were rare and valuable.\nWith a flick of one finger, Rusk brought back the journal he\u2019d been reading, a brown book with heavily overwritten and doodled pages, crackly with time and the stains of miscellaneous lab fluids. He considered a passage Ayatta had highlighted in the journal at some point in the past.\nWe are all palimpsests, wiped clean by each breath. Words and images, scars and hurts drift to the surface ghosting through and coloring the moment, the now, strangely, again and again, but again and again, wiped clean, until the paper shreds and all that will be writ is memory.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhere most of Acheron had been hewn from solid stone, the crumbling warehouses of the Shoals had been constructed of crushed rock mixed with mud; the resulting architecture, eaten by sea wind and storm, was shored up with mud from the flats, patches of wood, sand castings, scavenged metal, broken industrial ceramics, and other recycled materials. It had been divided over and over into smaller bits of real estate, housing warrens, a grey market, gaming dens. Hodge-podge architecture for hodge-podge tenants. The area swam in sea fog most hours of the day and night.\nRusk found the advocacy center where it sat in a much-patched warehouse building on Russet Street. The center was closed to observe the loss of its founder, but soon, a sign in the window by the door promised, to reopen.\nThrough the window, the center was dark and looked empty.\nRusk twisted the tip of his left pointer finger precisely; a lock pick slid out with a quiet snick. Inside, the space was tall and drafty and filled with podium desks and tables with mismatched chairs on either side. For conferencing between clients and advocates, Rusk surmised.\nIt was not entirely empty.\nA woman, full human, stood at one of the podiums, leaning forward with her elbows on an open folder of papers, fiddling with something in her hands. She was sucking on a hard candy; Rusk could smell the sugar.\nIn the sparse light from the windows, a forest of shadows lay between them. The woman met his gaze, but didn\u2019t say anything, studying him. Despite the youth implied by the way she sucked at her candy, she was older, lines at her eyes and the corners of her mouth, softness to her neck. Her eyes were dark, her skin and hair pale; in a city of exotically varied humans and farragoes, she was not notable.\n\u201cYou\u2019re from the Devisers College,\u201d he said, after a long moment of mutual studying.\n\u201cRusk. You\u2019re as beautiful as they always say. And as perceptive.\u201d She cocked her head. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d\n\u201cYou remind me of Ayatta,\u201d Rusk said. The woman recalled Ayatta to him so strongly, in fact, that Rusk felt a sense of dislocation. Though his deviser had been dark of skin and hair and striking, if not beautiful, there was a sharpness here, an air of unrestrained inquiry and focus, so very like Ayatta the two women could have been siblings.\n\u201cThe brilliant Ayatta,\u201d the woman said. \u201cI\u2019m flattered.\u201d She clicked the candy against her teeth. \u201cSo what are you doing here, \u2019zam Rusk?\u201d\n\u201cLooking into a murder, at Marshal Luin\u2019s request.\u201d\nShe nodded, as if he confirmed her own conclusion. \u201cI\u2019m Karst Noa,\u201d she said, \u201cCurrently serving as catastrophic failure examiner at the college.\u201d\n\u201c\u2019Zama Karst.\u201d Rusk inclined in a fractional bow. \u201cSo you examined Sirin\u2019s remains.\u201d\nA nod.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t exactly failure that befell Sirin.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d She lifted and dropped her shoulders in a shrug. \u201cBut it was fairly catastrophic for him.\u201d Her lip turned up slightly.\nRusk didn\u2019t react to the joke. He could scent furtiveness on her. \u201cIs the college investigating Sirin\u2019s murder then?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the destruction of the farrago created by Deviser Droma?\u201d Karst Noa said, and showed her stand on the rights of farragoes with the statement\u2014quite intentionally, Rusk sensed. Her resemblance to Ayatta evaporated. \u201cNo, \u2019zam Rusk,\u201d her use of the honorary held a note of irony now, \u201cI\u2019m investigating etheric traces left on the farrago\u2019s parts, a residue we haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d\n\u201cOh? How curious. It\u2019s different than the prana?\u201d Prana was what Ayatta had called the life force, her breath that was now his breath.\nKarst Noa grimaced at his mention of the word, as if he\u2019d said something in very poor taste. \u201cMarkedly,\u201d she said. She came out from behind the podium and Rusk saw that the thing in her hands was a small device. A kind of energy reader, perhaps, though he\u2019d never seen one like it. She held it up between herself and Rusk, scanning Rusk without trying to hide it.\nKarst\u2019s brows rose, then she shut the devise abruptly. Her gaze on Rusk was sharp and curious.\nRusk glanced toward the stairs in a dark hall at the back of the room. Sirin had lived \u2014 and died \u2014 above the center.\nBut Karst Noa was between him and the stairs and she wasn\u2019t moving. A jagged creeping sense through his carvings told him it was the better part of discretion not to try and pass by her.\nResolved to return later, he gave the woman a stiff, slight bow and departed, feeling her gaze on him long after he\u2019d left the center behind.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nShe eyed Rusk and flicked a raisin away. \u201c\u2019Zam Rusk.\u201d\n\u201cDiligence, Chierzisa.\u201d Rusk joined her against the half wall, putting his hands in the pockets of his loden coat. He never called her \u2019zama; it made her growl. \u201cWhat do you hear, kaa\u2019ma?\u201d\nFlick. The dirty floor was dotted with raisins. \u201cAbout what, \u2019zam?\u201d\n\u201cA farrago named Sirin, ran an advocacy center.\u201d\n\u201cFigured they\u2019d fob that off on you.\u201d She inspected the sticky ball for further offence. \u201cAnd you, being the good little well-made farrago, are to investigate the unfortunate \u2018disassembling\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cMurder,\u201d Rusk said.\nShe grunted, took a bite of sticky ball and said around it, \u201cYou say. But whoever did it won\u2019t get charged with nothing.\u201d\nNearby, two merchants started arguing over a spot in the patchwork market.\n\u201cHe was a do-gooder, Sirin,\u201d Chierzisa said, with a curl of lip. \u201cJust your sort.\u201d\nA full human, well dressed and slumming, stopped by them, eyes on Rusk. He made a specific gesture with his left hand. Rusk shook his head, looking away; Chierzisa growled low in her throat, a fierce sound \u2014 one of the reasons Rusk called her kaa\u2019ma, little lion. Chierzisa often called Rusk the garnish, or the bauble, and she resented him and the privilege he was afforded \u2014 but she hated full humans more. The man shrugged and moved off.\nRusk was used to such approaches. Ayatta had fashioned him of ivory carved from the giant bones of extinct beasts, from ammolite, and nacre; for his hair she used many thousands of silk threads in all shades of umber and shadow. A cunning mixture of seawater and nut oil pumped in his torso and the veins she fashioned to lubricate the servos of his joints. For a heart he had a miniature dynamo, a dangerous thing of enormous power contained only by Ayatta\u2019s genius and artistry. His brain she called a palimpsest, and had noted nothing more about it in her devising journals. She had called life into him on her own breath, so he breathed, and that was the life in him; the clockwork and sea steam and dynamo of his heart might continue on, but if the animus, the prana, of her breath left him, he believed his life would go with it.\n\u201cWord was,\u201d Chierzisa said as she licked her fingers, skin and crystal alike, of sticky ball remains, \u201cSirin was dealing his own parts to prop up the center.\u201d\nRusk sat back further on the wall, taking that in. Only the most miserable of farragoes would sell off their own parts; that didn\u2019t tally with what he\u2019d heard of Sirin so far; but perhaps his dedication to the cause of the advocacy center had become obsession.\nRusk slipped Chierzisa a coin and left the market.\nThe streets of the Shoals, mostly unpaved and narrow, were still obscured by remnants of the night\u2019s fog. Morning light gilded here and there, an illusion of grace.\nRusk knew most of the dealers in farrago parts, and where they did business. A detailed map of the whole of Acheron, including the Shoals, had been laid out in his brain by tours through the city with Ayatta; it was annotated and refined every time he walked its streets.\nNavigating the maze of alleys and byways to check with various dealers, his senses prickled. Someone was shadowing him, though they managed to keep out of sight with admirable skill.\nDown another muddy alley he found the door of his fifth dealer of the morning. This one went by the name Faille and had a not-bad reputation, as such things went. Rusk paused, taking in the fact that Faille\u2019s door was raw, recently cut wood planks; marks of violence showed on the mud and stone where the hinges were also new. The burnt-edge scent of ironwood sap and fresh cut timber stung the air.\nHe knocked on the door, his carved knuckles tumping on the wood. It was opened, after a shuffle of footsteps, by an old man. Seeing Rusk, his eyes widened, then narrowed. \u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cDiligence, \u2019zam,\u201d Rusk said.\nFaille had a tired web of lines under his eyes; a slight tremor shook the hand on the new door, keeping it open only a small span between them.\n\u201cYou had some trouble here, \u2019zam?\u201d Rusk indicated the door and hinges.\n\u201cWhat business is that of yours?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m looking into what happened to a farrago named Sirin. Did you know him?\u201d\nFaille blew out a breath, deflating slightly. He backed a step and turned away, leaving the door open. \u201cYou may as well come in,\u201d he said.\nInside it was dim and warm and smelled of aged human flesh, farrago oil, and metal. A makeshift kitchen, plank shelves, table, hotplate, and wood stove took up the front of the room. The shelves were covered with bins of parts; the table was both work and dining space. A mug sat by a half-assembled set of finger joints, a lightbox eye-piece hanging over the back of the chair that Faille resumed. A low, unmade bed under the one window, which looked out on the mudflats, with a back door to the convenience beyond it, completed the dealer\u2019s home.\nFaille picked up his mug, tipped it to the light. \u201cMarshal send you?\u201d he said.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nThe mudflats were a cool pour of light and landscape through the window.\n\u201cDid you buy parts from Sirin, \u2019zam Faille?\u201d\n\u201cJust spare bits from those his deviser had left him. Gave him a fair price, too. Not my business if he was loon enough to finance his work on his own bits.\u201d\nRusk nodded. \u201cHe felt strongly about farrago rights, apparently. Do you know if he had any particular enemies?\u201d\nFaille\u2019s gaze drifted back out the window; his lips compressed in a brief frown, then he said, \u201cNo one in particular, no.\u201d\nRusk let the obvious lie float between them, wondering what might have prompted it.\n\u201cWhat happened to your door, \u2019zam Faille?\u201d\nFaille shifted and Rusk could taste the old man\u2019s fear through his carvings.\nOut on the flats the tide was just beginning to come in, a line of white foamed green-grey over brown-black muck.\n\u201cLast time Sirin come by,\u201d the old dealer said, \u201che were\u2026 haunted. Said it was a thing he\u2019d found, and its loneliness\u2026 its loneliness haunted him. Sounded like he\u2019d gone the round the bend, yeah? He said this thing was mostly incorporeal, but sometimes, for moments, it gained form, it was beginning to get better at it \u2014 a thing neither human or farrago, but an amalgam of beasts \u2014 fabled things like bear, stag, tiger, eagle, and other s\u2014 shifting and changing.\u201d\nRusk considered this bizarre information. He heard the old man\u2019s heart, pulse growing faster.\n\u201cIt was what he said, what Sirin saw,\u201d Faille said, all in a rush, waving one hand at the door, \u201cit come here, a great thing with steaming flanks and branchy things,\u201d he waved the hand at his own head, \u201call fur, feathers, and claws and its eyes \u2014 dark and glowing. It splintered the door and stood there, heaving like the ocean. Then it \u2026 it spit this,\u201d he pulled an object from his pocket, lifting half up from the chair awkwardly, \u201cspit it out \u2026 and left, disappeared into smoke and shivering air not a step beyond the door frame. That thing\u2019s what killed Sirin.\u201d\nFaille held an object up in his shaking fingers for Rusk to see: a small teardrop crystal, dark blue fractured with veins of light, joined to a delicate, complex structure of metal pins and tiny gears, the gears and pins bent. Rusk recognized it as a piece of the heart engine of a farrago.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nNot quite all his remains, Rusk thought, picturing the bit of heart engine Faille had shown him. He didn\u2019t know what to make of this development, or whether even to credit it; Faille\u2019s fear had been real enough, but fear was not truth.\nEven if Rusk discovered who had killed Sirin, the only punishment would be a fine, paid to the college in the absence of Sirin\u2019s deviser.\nThe sense of being stalked slipped over him again.\nHe slowed his steps slightly. A district of mostly empty, broken down buildings rose around him. Many such structures crisscrossed the Shoals. Through this one, Shoalies had erected many little mud hodoes, crude statues of people meant to propitiate the lonely haunts that were said to infest parts of the city. These had been decorated with clamshells and phosphorous kelps from the sea; a lurid decaying glow in shades of green and brown made the hodoes seem poor company even for lonely haunts.\nRusk crossed the narrow, pitted street and slid a glance behind him. Through a gap in what had once been a garden wall, intimation of movement and a whisper of sound.\nA flash of weakness went through him like a knife, sending him to his knees. The empty, hollow-eyed buildings and sickly glow of the lumpen hodoes yawed wide around him, his senses spinning.\nHe drew a sharp breath, drawing from his well of prana, as he picked up a rock from the street, focused on the rustle of movement, and threw the rock. A thump and a scuffle as of something dropped, a low curse, and the weakness and pain disappeared. Rusk shot to his feet, running for the gap in the wall, but when he reached it the space on the other side was empty. The sandy mud showed signs of recent footsteps and hasty retreat.\nRusk considered pursuit, but whoever it was seemed likely to come looking for him again on their own.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSirin\u2019s room above the advocacy center was as tall-ceilinged and drafty as the center; it had beaten, but comfortable furniture over threadbare carpets. The stains of the farrago\u2019s bodily fluids, oil and seawater, marked the place where he\u2019d died in a wide splatter pattern. Rusk knelt and ran fingers over the stains. The scents of the various fluids remained in the fibers of the heavy, colorful carpet.\nRusk stood. The room\u2019s esoteric clutter yielded little at first. There were files from the center below in precarious stacks, but also collections of shells, driftwood, bits of rock and architectural detritus, banister knobs and lintel carvings; feathers, bird eggs, fish bones.\nThen, under a deep pile of fabric scraps \u2014 the only reason it hadn\u2019t been confiscated by the Devisers College when they cleared out Sirin\u2019s remains, Rusk surmised \u2014 a logos.\nThe logos was in its default form, a blank slate, blue-gray as a roof tile. The only other logos Rusk had ever seen, Ayatta\u2019s, reset automatically to this default after a certain amount of elapsed time. Rusk tapped the slate twice and drew a counter-clockwise circle on its surface. The logos shuddered in one all-over tremor and became a slim, hand-bound book with covers made of heavy paper layered into board and painted dark red. Detail of a pinioned wing rising from a furred shoulder haunch was painted in metallic inks on its front. In traveler\u2019s script, the title read An Amalgam of Creature Life.\nRusk suddenly thought he knew why Sirin had been selling his parts; a logos would be an invaluable resource for the advocacy center. Except why then hide it under a pile of scraps in his apartment?\nThe book Rusk held now, the last book Sirin had called up on this logos, was old, but not ancient. It crackled when he opened it, the scent of paper, oil paint, and age \u2014 and some musky scent Rusk could not identify \u2014 rising from its pages. The table of contents covered creatures from Anteloriskuneer to Zebraccoocelot.\nRusk turned to an entry at random. The scroll of precise writing carving the surface of the pages reminded Rusk of the symbols that carved his own fingers and arms.\nLiophantimarm. There was a richly inked drawing of a creature with gold-ruffed mane, lion\u2019s head, marmoset\u2019s forearms and little hands, and a heavy elephantine body with a long simian tail. Tusks poked out from the mane. The liophantimarm lives on the edge of jungle where it meets river-cut plains, the text began. It went on to describe range, feeding habits, mating rituals.\nRusk flipped through the pages to other entries, then to the frontispiece and the end papers, searching for some clue as to the book\u2019s origin. An elaborate art project, written like an encyclopedia of natural study? He ran his fingertips slowly over the imprint of the writing on one page, seeking some sense of the hand that had held the pen.\nEnergy, spiky, inky, and prana-filled, slid up through his fingers; a shift of the air, a shiver through his whole being, followed by the certain knowledge of what he would find when he turned around. He could hear it breathing and a musky scent came heavy on the air \u2014 the dry musk from the book, revitalized.\nA smoky steam lifted off the creature\u2019s rough fur and leathery hide as it hulked in the middle of Sirin\u2019s room, tusks and eyes catching the light. It sat back on elephant hind legs. The carpeted floor creaked under its weight. Its long tail curled around, the end caught in clever, black-fingered hands playing with the tail\u2019s fur tuft. The tusks were nicked and scarred and its eyes glowed black, like coals rotten with ember.\nRusk recalled Faille\u2019s description of the thing that had been haunting Sirin: a great thing with steaming flanks and branchy things. If the logos had been left open, set to this journal\u2026\nThis creature was not what Faille had described; that had sounded more like\u2026Rusk flipped carefully through the pages. There, another fine illustration, the Reindigrecock, heavy mass of antlers on a silkily feathered tiger\u2019s head, body a merging of giant peacock and deer.\nThrough his other senses, he felt an alteration in the air\u2014and that quickly, even as he looked back up, the creature had shifted to become the image on the page to which Rusk had turned. Its antlers were mossy, feathers iridescent and glossy around the tiger muzzle. The same smoky steam rose off it in wisps and the eyes remained the same \u2014 dark and glowing, as Faille had said.\nThe beast took a step toward him. Its front legs were striped tiger legs, its back legs pea fowl legs ending in spreading hooves. Rusk was mesmerized, even before the longing of the creature reached him, creating a weight of need in the air between them.\nIt pushed its heavy head into Rusk\u2019s hand when he lifted it.\nThe fur of its face was rough and warm, lip lifting over a fang with a low, unthreatening rumble; the feathers were long and soft as breath. Rusk touched the antlers wonderingly. One great paw lifted and rested on his shoulder as they regarded one another. He could feel that the beast was working to communicate something to him, feel it through his carvings, through the creature\u2019s gaze.\nThen the beast growled in earnest.\nA painful pull went through him \u2014 the same knife-cut of weakness he\u2019d experienced in the street. He tried to move and found himself struck in place as his prana was drawn from him, sucked like marrow from a bone.\nRusk stared at the snarling beast, shocked to have sensed its intent so wrongly. Then he heard a step behind him and understood.\nIt wasn\u2019t the beast.\nMore steps, and Karst Noa came into view beyond the creature\u2019s hulking shoulder. Her eyes burned with hate\u2014a burning far more terrible than that in the beast\u2019s eyes. She advanced on Rusk, her \u201creader\u201d device sucking his prana, his life.\nThe beast shifted. One large paw pushed Rusk and he staggered back, falling to one knee as the beast rose up, growl giving into roar as it swung on Karst, antlers lowering for a swipe. Karst leapt back, dodged, and darted in around the beast to snatch the logos from Rusk\u2019s frozen grip.\nHe watched her, unable to move. The pain of his prana being pulled from him was excruciating. The etheric seal cracked, sucked dry, on his left thumb; the carved and jointed set of ivory digits fell from his hand and lay on the carpet, parts. One of his eyes was losing focus, light and vision going dark.\nHaving leapt back again, Karst shut the journal book of beasts. \u201cRevert,\u201d she said. The book shivered once and became the logos slate.\nEven as it shimmered into mist-smoke, the antlered head swung around again and the ember-coals of the creature\u2019s eyes stared into Rusk\u2019s, burning in the dim air of Sirin\u2019s room seconds after the rest of the beast faded. A shot of vital anima reached Rusk, a stealth lightning strike, cutting the pain in a sweet, harsh jolt. Riding its infusion, Rusk sprang and rolled into Karst\u2019s legs. As she fell over him, reader in one hand, logos in the other, Rusk grabbed the logos and continued rolling.\n\u201cRecall,\u201d he said to it. The journal reformed in his hands. The beast shimmered back into being, charging Karst as she regained her feet. A swipe of one great paw sent the not-just-a-reader from her hand. The device hit the wall and fell to the carpet in two pieces.\nRusk sagged as the harsh internal pull cut off.\nKarst stood, gripping her bloody hand. The beast paced back and forth before her, snarling.\n\u201cYou killed Sirin,\u201d Rusk said.\n\u201cNo. I took him down to parts.\u201d\nRusk climbed to his feet and brushed himself off. \u201cMurdered,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI can\u2019t be charged with murder; there\u2019s nothing you can do to me.\u201d\nRusk regarded her, and the beast pacing before her. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be required to.\u201d\nHer gaze went to the steaming antlers, bared fangs, back to Rusk. \u201cRevert the logos.\u201d It was an order, but the veneer of imperious authority had gone thin over anger and fear.\n\u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d\nHer lips thinned and her hands fisted on the broken device, then she threw one hand out awkwardly, gesturing at the beast, at Rusk. \u201cMonsters, calling forth monsters. Reason enough. I tracked the energy signature of this \u2026 thing \u2026 and the farrago wouldn\u2019t give it up. It shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d Her gaze was unfocused now, as she watched inner demons. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d\nThe beast gave an agitated, stuttered peacock shout, with a growl under it, and Karst said again, \u201cRevert the logos.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Rusk took a step; the beast gave ground a step and the black glowing eyes met his. For a moment, Rusk forgot Karst\u2019s presence. It was a wide moment; he floated in it, a sense of echoing depth. He swayed, dizzy, and then grounded again.\nHe considered Karst and the broken device in her hands. Tucking the logos under one arm he held out a hand, indicating the device.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that.\u201d\nHer hands were white knuckled. \u201cUnder what authority?\u201d\n\u201cMarshal Luin\u2019s. I\u2019ll pass the device, along with my evidence, to her,\u201d Rusk said.\nKarst shook her head.\nThe beast stepped closer to her, brushed up against her, just lightly.\nRusk smiled, not a pleasant smile. \u201cYou\u2019ve met my new friend?\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHe was in the garden again when Marshal Luin came to hear his report. He told her over steamed chocolate; a cold fog had rolled up from the Shoals to take the whole city shortly after he left Sirin\u2019s building with the reverted logos slate, the pieces of Karst Noa\u2019s device, and the bone digits of his thumb tucked inside his loden coat.\nLuin took the pieces of Karst Noa\u2019s device, frowning over them and his account. She left still frowning, and without offering any thoughts on whether Karst faced anything more than a fine.\nRusk, however, had spread the word about Karst Noa, telling Chierzisa and others. He didn\u2019t count her future days very bright.\nThe fog had not lifted by the following morning, but Rusk was too restless to be inside the house.\nMist lay through the little garden orchard and beaded on the heliotrope flowers, an ache of violet in the gray. Small, cyan-blue birds winged through the garden, worrying at each other, their calls echoing between the garden\u2019s deep stone walls. One lit on Rusk\u2019s carved bone fingers to take the seed he offered it. His reattached thumb curled to his palm, not entirely reintegrated to his system.\nThe bird fluttered away. Rusk activated the logos on the table before him. He called up An Amalgam of Creature Life, and opened it.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue27\/3lbe27_story5.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"\u201cThere\u2019s been a disassembling in the Shoals,\u201d Marshal Luin announced as she navigated the narrow stone stairs behind Rusk\u2019s house.

Would she ask for her boots back when Brim pulled her out of the drove?\nWater rose before the narrow bulwark Brim stood upon, crashing against the base of the wall. The ancient edifice had been built long before the battered village, along the slender peninsula of the jetty. The jetty bowed out from the northern cliffs of the island and curled around the crags of its eastern coast, a beckoning finger of many thousands of steps\u2019 length that sheltered Brim\u2019s home in a cove.\nThe silver afternoon sky darkened. Brim gritted her teeth. Ebba\u2019s harpoon fit her well enough. Through the slits in her bone goggles, Brim\u2019s eyes traced it down to the coiled rings of its rope to where it ended, wound about one of the rusted leverage hooks that adorned the wall. She had been practicing. She thought she could lift her sister\u2019s weight.\nShe must.\nIn the long months since the last High Tide, Brim had awoken cold on many brittle spring mornings, her sleeping hands patting the empty hammock that had been Ebba\u2019s. Brim had traveled to the fish market during summer days in her sister\u2019s boots, almost forgetting that Ebba no longer trudged through puddles alongside her. Brim had sat at Father\u2019s bedside this past winter and dreamed Ebba was laughing there by the fire, distracting them from the damp sound of his labored breathing.\nIt had been a hard year for everyone. Most villagers only came to the wall for funerals: some rituals feel safer to abide by, especially those concerning the dead. One after another the bodies were cast from their capstones along the wall. They plummeted headlong into the sea. If the sea was kind and the families patient, it was said that the waves would one day bear the bodies back to shore to be granted new life during the next High Tide.\nFamilies were hardly patient any more, and the sea was hardly kind. Each time the tide had risen near high enough for the drove to reappear, someone had died \u2014 from fever or chill or being old and weatherworn \u2014 and the hungry sea had pulled away, satiated.\nNo one could remember the last time a villager had been brought back from a drenched tomb. Hardly anyone even wanted the drove to arrive. It was painful to see familiar white bodies writhing beneath the waves like maggots in foul meat. And what were the odds that a fisher could not only spot a loved one\u2019s corpse beneath the waves, but also bring it ashore? The wall was long, the waves strong, the water dark.\nWould Ebba smile if Brim plucked her from the drove? Would she rise, dripping and laughing, life restored after months of submersion? Brim imagined reeling Ebba in. Imagined Ebba clinging to the parapet and pulling herself over. Unlike Brim, Ebba always took pleasure in doing things on her own, however she liked. Between the two sisters there had always been their gasping father, the earthbound fish swaddled in blankets, eyes vacant \u2014 but it was only ever Brim left holding the bedpan.\nThe waves rose higher, cascading into the wall with all the racket of a hurricane. Brim hummed her lips against the inside of her mask. She tightened her grip on the harpoon.\nThe sound of the waves shattering below became a shattering and thumping. More than water was slamming against the jetty\u2019s base. Brim squinted into the depths, and saw, quite clearly, white flashes beneath the surface. She watched another corpse thump into the jetty.\nAs far as she could see in the graying light, the waves were laden with white shapes, shadows of the village\u2019s dead.\nThe drove had returned.\nIt was because her eyes were fixed on the crashing waves that Brim did not see the other fisher approaching. It would have been difficult to hear unsteady footsteps on stone over the noise of the wind and sea. She started when the newcomer cupped hands against the side of her covered ear.\n\u201cBrim.\u201d\nBrim stiffened. She knew that voice: Lo.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nEbba always squealed with mock horror whenever the old man lifted his pant leg to reveal a scar like a white comet, its tail extending from the back of his shins up past the underside of his knee. He told them that the harpoon that pulled him out had been seven feet long, and that the woman who had done it had asked for marriage once he was yanked out.\nEver since his submersion, his eyes were ceaselessly leaking seawater. He said he drank so much from his spigots to make sure his insides would not dry up. He said that words could not express what it was like to be carried around the world alongside dead brethren, caught in the currents that traced countless coasts, his lungs filled with water \u2014 the same salty water that now leaked from his eyes.\nFather was sick even then, so it was Lo\u2019s duty to come away from cleaning and send the girls homeward down the hill after the tavern keeper lapsed into snoring.\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t a harpoon wound,\u201d murmured Lo, once. He and Brim lingered in Ebba\u2019s wake as she slip-skated across the winding ice of the village street. \u201cHe got that scar when he was our age, from a fall and a broken fence. He\u2019s never died at all.\u201d\nEbba stopped. \u201cMaybe not. But what harm can he do?\u201d\nLo shuffled his feet. \u201cIf people believe him \u2026 people might go to the wall.\u201d\nEbba snorted. \u201cWhich idiots are you so worried about?\u201d\nLo looked Brim dead in the eye; not Ebba, but Brim.\n\u201cOh?\u201d\nLo flushed. \u201cI just meant \u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you worry, Lo. If my sister slips on the ice, I\u2019ll catch her!\u201d Ebba twisted herself like a dancer, wordlessly beckoning them on. She knew they would always follow her.\nAnd wasn\u2019t that what they were doing now, months after her funeral?\nShe can laugh. Ebba can laugh all she wants when we pluck her from the drove.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cBrim!\u201d\nBrim listened to the smack of the corpses below. \u201cYou\u2019ve followed her, too.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Lo\u2019s panicked breaths, filtered through his mask, seeped into her ear. \u201cNot her!\u201d\nBrim saw another white arm and a mat of pallid hair. The nearest of the drove, emerging from black waves. A pale child, emaciated and drawn. The waves flipped her forward and pressed her against the wall. Her stomach was deflated, her eyes white, her hair tangled as the waves recalled her.\n\u201cI\u2019m not about to go home without her, Lo.\u201d\nA second wave contained more and more, all elbows and knees. And the third rose high enough that all along the wall, the glossy dead of the island slapped against the jetty.\nLo shouted over the cacophony. \u201cAnd if Ebba strikes elsewhere?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see her.\u201d She loved being seen.\nWater slopped down from between the nearest parapets, soaking them to the marrow. Brim imagined Lo\u2019s eyes were wide beneath his goggles. He pressed himself closer, away from the dead that were getting caught on the wall, were bowed over it. More water crested the wall.\nA dull moaning arose from the waves crashing below. Beside her, Brim felt Lo tremble as the dead wave cascaded over the wall entire. Now members of the drove were almost within grasp; Ebba pulled Lo back as one woman, wrinkled with age and algae-specked, nearly landed atop them. Lifeless forearms scraped against the stone inches away, tangled limbs rose higher and water, more water, splashed down into Ebba\u2019s boots.\nBrim braced herself and grabbed the wall. Beside her a dead man, suspended by his midriff and caught on a bulwark, was groaning from his tattered throat. Farther down, entire writhing bodies lay on the wall. A few had been carried beyond, to the other side; they would have to be cleared from the shoreline in the morning. There could be no restoring those neglected bodies that were beached overnight.\n\u201cWe have to go!\u201d Lo clutched Brim\u2019s slippery arm.\nMore than seawater drenched her face, though Lo could not know it. \u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d\nLo began to pull her away, stumbling over foreign limbs and torsos as he yanked her forcefully toward the shore. \u201cThese corpses are made up of years, decades; don\u2019t you think I want to search for my own sisters, my mother?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re frightened. But I won\u2019t be anymore!\u201d\nShe gasped as another corpse spun up over the wall between them, nearly knocking her backwards into the water. A cold hand slapped her across the shoulder.\nLo pressed his mouth to her ear. \u201cEbba wasn\u2019t frightened, and look where she is now! Gone off on her own again, for good! She wouldn\u2019t want to be followed this time!\u201d\nBrim growled and tried to pull away, but he held her tight. She could barely see. The harpoon, dislodged from the hook, dragged behind her, catching here and there on the dead underfoot. Lo kept pulling.\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t always get what she wants!\u201d Brim cried, unsure that he could hear her.\nFrom the corner of her eye, Brim saw a bloated severed limb \u2014 a leg? \u2014 soaring near. She held tight to Lo\u2019s arm and shoved him to the ground. She thought she heard the splash as it hit the surface of the lagoon.\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t want to shrivel up, swollen and bedridden like Father!\u201d Brim rested her forehead against the wall.\nBefore and behind them, countless corpses dotted the slippery wall in piles, in squirming heaps. The sea was generous. Lo was panting so loudly that Brim could hear it above all else. He had given up pulling altogether. There was blood running down from the bottom of his mask. He\u2019d hit his head against the stones when Brim shoved him.\n\u201cI could have caught her.\u201d The words flooded from Brim\u2019s mouth. \u201cThat day I left Father to get fish salve at market. For his chapped lips. I heard her laugh, saw her slip from across the street. I was holding a basket. And for some reason, I didn\u2019t drop it. Maybe I was angry that she was laughing while I was buying fish salve. She left me alone with him again. But I watched her fall towards the stone and for an instant I considered catching her and then some part of me decided she could always catch herself. And I didn\u2019t drop the basket.\u201d\nBrim closed her eyes. All she felt was sea breeze, all she was was cold and wet. Salt in her nostrils, in her eyelashes. Beside her, Lo was heaving. Brim could not wipe her nose with the mask on. She could not wipe her eyes.\nFinally Lo said: \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to be caught.\u201d\nBrim laughed \u2014 a broken rasp. \u201cI suppose not.\u201d\nThe wind whipped around her and for a moment she did not feel it. At last she helped Lo to his feet. They stumbled toward the village.\nShe became aware that the tide was lowering and light was breaking in the sky \u2014 the tail of evening sun, clearing the sky to pale green. The worst had passed. But so many of the drove were marooned on the wall. Would they dry out by morning? Would they smell like fish?\nWhen the shoreline was almost close enough to leap for, Lo stopped and gazed back out to sea. Brim could not see his expression, but she could feel him tense beneath her grip.\nLo pointed out to the diminishing tide and cried: \u201cEbba!\u201d\nThey should have all looked the same, Brim knew. Water-encased corpses should have been impossible to differentiate between.\nBut Ebba was Ebba, even in death. She was caught adrift on a recoiling wave, braced in foamy white. Her hair was bleached to match her skin, her bones seemed fragile beneath her flesh. On her scalp was the bulge of a water-swollen wound that revealed her skull to the air. But there was no mistaking the shape of her, the shape that had danced on ice.\n\u201cYour harpoon, Brim!\u201d\nBrim was already throwing it. She had no time to tie it to the wall, so she and Lo held tight to the end of the rope and watched the harpoon sail into the sea.\nBrim cursed. She had aimed wide. She yanked it back, pulling the rope quickly into a loose coil on the ground.\n\u201cAgain, Brim!\u201d\nShe gripped the spear tight in her sister\u2019s gloves and Lo held her steady as she pulled the harpoon back. With an almighty thrust she threw it into the sea.\nThe barbed point pierced her sister\u2019s stomach and lodged there. From the end of the line, Brim could feel it catch, and then she could feel her wriggling. Slowly, arms protesting, she and Lo hoisted Ebba up, over the wall. It took much longer than she had ever anticipated; it seemed that Ebba resisted, that she had grown impossibly heavy after soaking in all that saltwater.\nFinally, Ebba was free of the water. She weighed even more. Lo cried aloud and Brim\u2019s arms had all but given out when at last the tip of Ebba\u2019s pale head, followed by her narrow face, followed by the protrusion of her chest, and her speared navel, crested the wall.\nShe did not climb up herself.\nBrim nearly fell backwards into the sea as Ebba flopped onto the stones at her boots.\n\u201cEbba,\u201d said Lo, after a moment of stillness.\nHer hair hung lank. Her mouth fell slack. She squirmed on the jetty; she writhed and twisted. From her throat sea foam was pouring; her eyes were vacant opals. She did not smile.\nFor an instant, Brim wanted to take her up into her arms. Wanted to pull her to her feet. She imagined again that Ebba would laugh, shake the water from her shoulders, cross her arms over her chest, and demand to be taken somewhere warm and given some proper clothing, given something to drink. Brim would trail behind when Ebba asked for a story or two. Father might even recognize her. Over time, her cheeks would regain their luster. The wound would heal to a white comet.\nThe thing that was Ebba sucked on empty air. Its limbs contorted and twitched.\n\u201cBrim\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cI know.\u201d\nAnd together, without ceremony, she and Lo cast her sister back into the sea.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue25\/3lbe25_story1.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"She was dressed in her sister's clothes, and that was why the chill found her so quickly.

He placed the crate of bottles on the porch of their two-story rental house. Papa would not be home from his research fellowship at the Trieste Laboratory for Marine Zoology, the Zoologische Station, until well after six o\u2019clock.\n\u201cNothing that requires dissection or a microscope, of course,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut I have an idea that I can test here at the house. Papa will be so proud.\u201d\n\u201cSi, signorine.\u201d\n\u201cGraciis.\u201d She knew less than ten words of the language spoken in this part of the Habsburg Empire along the northern Adriatic Sea, but she could at least manage a thank you.\nHe left, and she was alone again in a city of strangers.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhen he opened the door, Janika was sitting on the staircase where she had been waiting since five o\u2019clock, with her naturalist\u2019s journal ready in her lap. \u201cPapa!\u201d She stood up and took a step towards him, but then remembered that he did not like to be touched before he had time to wash up after handling eels all day.\n\u201cJanika. And I see you have your notebook.\u201d\n\u201cI have my eel question. I am ready.\u201d Papa\u2019s eel question was proving that eels were hermaphroditic and that one could be found with both male and female organs. He and Sigmund, who was simply looking for a male, dissected eels for the month-long fellowship. \u201cIt is something Gram used to say. About eels. She said if you rubbed your skin with an eel, then you would have the ability to see faeries. I do not believe in faeries, of course.\u201d It was important to say that quickly before Papa became angry. \u201cBut, it is easily tested. I will apply oil from the eel to my skin on a daily basis and record whether I see anything extraordinary. I can vary the locations on the skin, and the dose will be cumulative.\u201d\n\u201cFaeries. That sounds like her.\u201d Papa thought most of Mama\u2019s people were silly and gullible. He described them as \u201csimple carnies\u201d when he was in a good mood and \u201cdangerously foolish and irresponsible\u201d when he was grieving. It was too late to ask Gram for more information now. They had not spoken to anyone from Mama\u2019s family since the accident.\n\u201cThe topic is interesting. Such fanciful notions would benefit from occasional straight-forward testing. But, I am not sure about the rigor of your design. How will you know if you do see a faery? Have you ever seen one before?\u201d\nJanika knew a test when she heard it. \u201cMy hypothesis is that applying the eel oil will cause me to see something which I have never seen before, which I could then describe and sketch in my journal for comparison to known natural creatures. The null hypothesis is that I see nothing new. That much should be verifiable.\u201d\n\u201cAnd will this prove if eel oil conveys the fabled fae-sight?\u201d\n\u201cYes. No. Definitely no. If I see nothing new, it will provide proof that this eel did not give one girl the ability to see anything extraordinary that was available to be seen in our house or elsewhere in this city where I chanced to look during the twenty-three days left in our stay here. It will not answer whether there was nothing here to be seen. Or whether there still exists something I could have seen had I been in some other location. Or if it would have worked if I was younger or older than twelve. Or, if I had used a different eel. All we can learn is if it works for me, now, in this place, with the eel you will provide me.\u201d\n\u201cAgreed.\u201d Papa shook her hand very formally, and hugged her only with his eyes.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nOn the 6th day of the experiment, she started rubbing the eel oil into her eyes as well, assuming that the eyes ought to be involved with anything to do with seeing.\nOn the 13th day of the experiment, she caught her first glimpse of the shadow.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nVari seemed always to re-position itself in its tank to face the shadow. Watching.\nShe rubbed the eel oil on every inch of her skin, eager to speed the experiment, and to reach a next phase where she could see more than a glimpsed shadow.\n\u201cAre you a faery?\u201d she asked, but there was no response.\n\u201cAre you a boy?\u201d Nothing. But she could see, at times, clear signs that its shape was unlike hers, and distinctly masculine.\n\u201cAre you really there?\u201d Nothing.\nThen, she would lose sight of the shadow, and even the eel could not find it.\nJanika made up stories about the shadow and the eel. Sometimes the eel was her mother, because she drowned and maybe drowned people became fishes, even if they drowned in a human-sized fishbowl because they were too drunk to stay upright for their mermaid act.\nSometimes the shadow was the son she knew her father would have preferred. Sometimes the shadow was a brother she never knew she had. Sometimes it was just an imaginary friend that she could talk to all day long. It was better than talking to the milk boy. She could pretend that the shadow understood her.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cPapa?\u201d she asked on the night of the 18th day of the experiment. They were leaving Trieste for Vienna in less than a week. She would soon have to return her eel to the sea. She had begun to wonder if the shadow would disappear along with the eel, and if she wanted it to. It had never taken any clearer form, no matter how much eel oil she rubbed into her skin.\n\u201cYes?\u201d He was reading at his desk. She stood before him, journal tucked under one elbow.\n\u201cWould you have been happier if I had been a boy?\u201d\nHe shut his book, but still looked down at it, avoiding eye contact. \u201cI would have been happier if many things had been different, but I never wanted anything for you then that you be you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cThis is not a good time. Maybe when you are older. Go on to bed. It is late.\u201d\n\u201cYou never ask me what I have seen. If it worked. If I have seen a faery.\u201d\n\u201cHave you?\u201d His tone suggested he was sure she had not.\n\u201cI have begun seeing something. I do not know if it is a faery, but it is something. It looks like a shadow. The shadow of a boy. Almost my shadow. But not mine.\u201d\n\u201cDo you have any idea how ridiculous that sounds? The point was to teach you reason, to teach you to test and reject folly, not to indulge your imagination.\u201d\nJanika saw the shadow move. It was slipping across the room, getting farther and farther from her. \u201cThere!\u201d she cried. \u201cIt is almost to the door.\u201d\nPapa looked up and stared at the exact spot where she could see the shadow. It struck her that he handled eels day in and day out, from eight in the morning to six at night. Surely he had more eel oil on his skin then she did.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked him. \u201cI know you can see it. Better even than I can.\u201d\n\u201cLet it go.\u201d\nAt go, the shadow fled from the room.\n\u201cWhat is it? What will I lose if I never see that shadow again?\u201d\n\u201cThere is no going back. She would have made a spectacle of you. A sideshow attraction. It was no life for a child.\u201d\n\u201cWho? Mama?\u201d\n\u201cShe said it was a gift. Natural. But, she would have exposed you to a thousand prying eyes. It is a natural state. Particularly in fish. Sometimes sequential, sometimes simultaneous, but relatively common. It is my life\u2019s work now to study it. But no animal gives its young to a barker to be a freak. I had to do something, so I took you to a doctor, and decided to make you my daughter when you were once so much more. I removed the choice, and your mother never forgave me for it.\u201d\nJanika felt like she was choking. She needed to get away from him. She needed to catch her shadow, and reclaim what she had lost. She caught sight of it at the top of the stairs and began to run.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe water began to wick up her skirts as soon as she reached its edge. The shadow stretched out ahead of her on the surface of the waves, and then slipped under.\nHer skirts grew heavier and heavier as she walked out into the sea.\nShe heard her father\u2019s voice, calling her name.\nShe kept walking and let the water swallow her knees and thighs and scar and breasts.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cI found it. A hermaphrodite eel.\u201d Janika\u2019s father knew that the boy who delivered the milk would not understand him, but he was so equally excited and privately horrified that he needed to tell someone. \u201cAfter dissecting hundreds, I finally found one.\u201d It was not Janika, he told himself. It was just a dead fish. He had to believe that.\n\u201cSi, signor.\u201d The boy who was not there to deliver milk smiled gently, and thought: Farewell, Papa. Janika would make her own life here, in the strange city so close to the sea. As whomever she wanted to be.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue22\/3lbe22_story2.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"'Papa promised me an eel of my own if I can propose a sufficiently interesting experiment,' Janika explained to the boy who delivered their milk.

Ona\u2019s lesson rang in his mind as he dragged his good hand along the fold, crushing the fibers. Half a yard along, he knew he had ruined another piece of paper. The tribesmen at the folding rocks ignored his groan. They flipped their newly-made sheets in skilled hands, forging them into sharp parallelogram units. The page is destroyed by the first crease, and is remade into one of the perfect forms, his Ona would say. Thus we have the use of it.\nIblesh looked at the ragged crease, off-center. Not in this case, he thought. He might not care, if he hadn\u2019t spent several days pulping the fibers for it with a heavy steel rod. He sighed, and started again. He worked a smooth stone across the middle of the page, bending low to hold the sheet in place with his stunted right arm.\nThe sun lifted high above the oasis. Work continued, at the pulping pits and the slurry pools. There could never be enough paper, especially just before a migration. Tribesmen dipped wire-frame deckles into the vats of pulped slurry. They spread the fibrous mixture out into sheets and placed the frames on the ground to dry. The sheets were pressed in stacks beneath large wooden boards, weighted with stones used by generations of hands. Across the waters of the oasis pools, women were stringing up the sheets from lines hung on the trees, the faint blush of colorful inks showing. Iblesh caught sight of his Ona, laying a rough page onto one of the cutting boulders, working a blade through the template scarred into the rock, sweeping aside the excess.\nShe paused in her work, somehow feeling his eyes on her. She smiled across the distance.\nSomeone whistled. Lunch.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cYou\u2019re frustrated, Iblesh.\u201d\nHe said nothing, poking at the berries and lichen in his folded bowl.\n\u201cYou\u2019re young,\u201d Ona said. \u201cYou\u2019ll learn.\u201d\nHer face, though weathered and tanned, was gorgeous. Soon he would appear the same age as his own grandmother. He did not know how old she was. When he asked her, she would reply that she couldn\u2019t remember a time when she wasn\u2019t alive. Did she smile a little when she said it? Teasing, elliptical responses he could never quite grasp.\n\u201cAt least I can crush pulp,\u201d he said. \u201cI can understand how to do that.\u201d\nIt was cool in their hut. The cream-colored paper modules were fitted snugly into a dome high enough to stand in. Ona swallowed the last mouthful of her own lunch, and smoothed out her bowl into a flat sheet crosshatched with wrinkles.\n\u201cThe perfect forms exist,\u201d she began, making a diagonal fold, \u201cwhether there is paper or not. We understand them, meditate upon them, and they come into being through us.\u201d Her deft fingers doubled the paper back onto itself, popped it out. He realized she was making a model of a li-li, one of the birds that migrated to the oasis for water. Finished, she held it up; though it was crisp, the neck was too long, the tail too short. \u201cImperfect. You see? But informed by the idea. The idea lives in it.\u201d With a snap she unmade the model, passed the wrinkled page to him. He took it with his good hand.\n\u201cAnd now the idea is gone?\u201d he asked.\nShe cocked her head.\n\u201cEven if there are no folds in the paper, the perfect forms exist. Think about this when you are working.\u201d\n\u201cI still don\u2019t get it,\u201d he murmured.\nShe grasped him by the wrist.\n\u201cYou will.\u201d\nHe thought of his toil, and how hard it was with his imperfect body.\n\u201cWhen will we go to the migration, Ona?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re tired of work, aren\u2019t you, Iblesh?\u201d\nHe nodded. Nothing was lost on her.\n\u201cDo you know when you\u2019ll be called?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cHow do you know it\u2019ll be me that\u2019s called?\u201d\nShe looked suddenly weary, and for a second he knew she was old.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always you, Ona.\u201d\nAnother whistle pierced the thin walls of their hut. Rising. Repeated.\nHer eyebrows flickered up.\n\u201cNot always.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cQuickly, now. We don\u2019t want to lose sight of her.\u201d\nPast the lowering huts, Iblesh could see the diviner. Isylla, a young girl, the triangle of her paper skirt reducing over the distance of the lichen-floored plain. She was walking, drawn by her trance, to the migration path of the tapijara.\nBreyu paused, gave Iblesh a forced smile as he packed his belongings into a small cube of doubled paper. Iblesh dropped his gaze, unable to meet that false look. He pities me, he thought. The deformed one, the orphan. They only tolerate me because of Ona.\n\u201cIsylla heard the call this time,\u201d the chief said to her.\nShe smiled.\n\u201cI knew she would, Breyu. Sooner or later.\u201d\n\u201cNo regrets?\u201d\n\u201cNone. It\u2019s no fun going without food or drink for three days.\u201d\nThe chief idly straightened a stack of modules, lifting them into a cube. Iblesh felt that he was trying to appear casual.\n\u201cWhen we get there,\u201d he said without looking at her, \u201cmaybe you will build a hut with me?\u201d\nOna smiled again, though Iblesh recognized she was being polite.\n\u201cAnother time,\u201d she replied.\nBreyu nodded, then sauntered off without reply.\n\u201cYou could have stayed with him, Ona,\u201d said Iblesh. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d\nShe looped her long hair into a bun, placed a wide-brim hat on her head.\n\u201cI would,\u201d she said. \u201cBreyu is too much the chief.\u201d\nIblesh was silent, his mind again stuck on his Ona\u2019s turn of phrase.\n\u201cYou have everything?\u201d she asked, smiling. \u201cWill you be ready to hunt?\u201d\nIblesh touched the tip of the curved metal cylinder in his packing cube, nestled in with some glass jars. Its alien metal surface reminded him of the tribe\u2019s last journey to the distant caravan routes. The memory was vague; he had been very small. Iblesh\u2019s family had traded their surplus paper. It had been shortly before their death.\n\u201cI\u2019m ready, Ona.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s get some water.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d said Iblesh, gathering his possessions. She tried to keep the disgust from her expression, pushing past him.\nOna helped him refold his cube, pack the empty jars and cylinder again.\n\u201cWhat about water?\u201d he said.\n\u201cSomeone will share,\u201d she replied.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThere was a cry ahead of Iblesh and Ona. A group of people paused, lowering their packs. A man was lying on the ground, collapsed, his belongings scattered about. Water from his store was puddled, seeping into the pale green lichen. It was Hando, the second man of the tribe. Two women crouched next to him and wept. The crowd broke into murmurs. Iblesh craned to look. The man\u2019s eyes were open, but his only movement was faint breathing.\n\u201cHe is desolate,\u201d said Ona.\nDesolate. Iblesh knew that his parents had fallen to the crippling weariness, on their return journey from the caravan route.\n\u201cWhat is wrong here?\u201d Breyu. He took one look at the prone tribesman.\n\u201cYou two,\u201d he said, clicking his fingers at a pair of young men. \u201cPick him up. He might come back.\u201d\nThe two women wailed as the men handed their packs to others. Iblesh presented himself, but was not needed. The young pair hefted the dead weight of their tribesman, wrapping his arms around their shoulders.\n\u201cWe must move,\u201d said Breyu.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAt sunset on the third day, Isylla came to a halt. She blinked, taking a confused look at the plain around her. Then, three days without food, she crumpled.\nThe night was perfectly still. The people went through the silent ritual of selecting new hutmates, many adults grouping into pairs, threes and fours. Older children were left to house themselves. The new groups built their huts, fitting the stock parallelograms into an array of shapes, weaving colors into their designs.\nIblesh and Ona set up their hut and went inside, yawning. Ona took a pair of docki stones from an envelope and cracked them together. There phosphorescence lit the hut. She put them in a pair of upturned cone lanterns. Iblesh plucked handfuls of lichen and placed them into bowls. On the dry plain, the lichen was one of the few plants that could survive, subsisting on water vapor. The staple of the tribe, it was bitter and unvarying.\nThey ate.\n\u201cWill the desolate ones come back, Ona?\u201d\nShe dipped a cup into the water box, drained it at one gulp.\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d she said, wiping her lips. \u201cSome do.\u201d\n\u201cWhat makes them?\u201d\n\u201cGo, or come back?\u201d Her teasing smile again.\nIblesh knew what made someone become desolate. Some hidden truth of reality was revealed, in an instant voiding a person\u2019s will to live, their will to move. It was taboo to speak of this truth, and Iblesh did his best not to think of it.\n\u201cCome back,\u201d he said.\nShe chewed her last bite of food, smoothing out her bowl in the familiar ritual. Working it nimbly, she halved the flat sheet and began a series of quick, small folds. Iblesh recognized the long beak, the semi-circular crest atop the head. She had created a wide-winged tapijara. With a flick of the wrist she made it fly. By a design of the folding it flew in an arc, encircling Iblesh where he sat. It glided behind him, coming back around to her. She tapped it on the underside as it came past, sending it higher. In this way the paper model traced circle after circle in the hut.\n\u201cWe are something like this tapijara,\u201d she said, tapping it again. \u201cWe can go on and on. Hando, who collapsed on the first night, is very old. Much older than me, though we appear the same age. We can continue, but something has to keep us going.\u201d\nThe tapijara swept past her again, and this time she left it alone. Two more circles and it landed in her lap. She looked at Iblesh, the point concluded.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said.\n\u201cMaybe Hando doesn\u2019t want to come back.\u201d\nIblesh blinked.\n\u201cBut what about the woman? Mahra. She has three children.\u201d\nAs soon as he spoke he remembered his parents, and the age he\u2019d been when their desolation came. They hadn\u2019t stirred from it.\n\u201cPerhaps her love for them will bring her back. Who knows?\u201d A flicker of impatience crossed Ona\u2019s face, a flicker of weariness. Something Iblesh had never seen in her. \u201cWe should rest,\u201d she said, lying down.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ona. I\u2019m sorry about your daughter.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault, Iblesh,\u201d she said over her shoulder. \u201cThe Burning One cannot be stopped.\u201d\nThe phrase rolled off her tongue, one of the lessons that he had heard many times. It was Ona\u2019s fatalism, he thought; a way to deal with her loss.\nA pale blue fire shone in his mind. A glimmer of a dream, or a memory.\n\u201cGo to sleep, Iblesh.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nListening.\nHe heard it. A whooping cry rang out. Black specks appeared in the sky, distant and sparse. The first of the tapijara. The men spun where they sat, turning to meet the migration path. More calls pierced the air, rising and falling, alien and urgent. The noise grew, distorting the excited shouts of the hunters. The men ran to reposition themselves into a wide crescent. They flipped open their cylinder lids.\nThe tapijara glided on steady wings. Their progress seemed slow, the pattern of their formation shifted with wind and the occasional flap. Some veered out to gain altitude, circling high. Their pace was deceptive; in no time they were within range of the tribesmen.\nIblesh\u2019s eye was drawn to one, off to the side. He watched it make small tilting adjustments, its long wings twitching. As the thin flock passed over their heads, the men released their harpoons. They sizzled into the sky, but none hit their mark. A webwork of lines drifted limply to the dry ground.\nIblesh\u2019s target swung away from the group, seeking an updraft. He tracked it, his finger waiting on the catch. It rose above the flock, hard crest shining red in the sun. When its long mouth opened to call out. Iblesh released the catch. The spring trembled as the harpoon shot into the air, trailing its thin cord. The tapijara swung back, intersecting with the flight of the harpoon. The steel broke through the reptile\u2019s neck.\nIblesh gave a whoop of triumph; he had claimed the first kill. The other men cheered with surprise.\nBroken, the tapijara fell to earth with twitching wings. Iblesh cranked the handle on his cylinder as he ran to meet it, re-spooling the line. He hauled his prize clear of the other harpoons. The creature\u2019s long beak made a curving gash in the sandy soil.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIt had been the perfect kill. The ceremony was timeless, perfect. And he, the deformed one, felt perfect in this moment.\nThere was an odd murmur among the women; the misshapen idiot was suddenly the village champion. They watched Isylla. She lifted the fallen creature in her arms, its soft wings collapsing, its long beak lolling. She pushed her fingers into the cut Iblesh had made, withdrawing dark flesh.\nShe ate, and everyone cheered.\nThe other tapijara were shared among the women, the bird-like bodies skinned with harpoon blades, the meat pulled forth and eaten raw. A small feast, on the first night of the migration, with many people watching on. Little of the creatures went to waste; the claws and gizzards were ground with pestle and mortar into a dark paste for the children.\nThe meal complete, music broke out. The tribe sang, chanted, clapped out polyrhythms that made Iblesh giddy. They blew hooting notes through long rolled tubes of paper, mimicking the whooping call of the tapijara.\nIblesh looked for his Ona, holding his second kill like a precious trophy. She wasn\u2019t in the crowd. He wandered to their hut, beaming, triumphant. The music of the tribe throbbed. He knew that he had started it, caused the revel. His heart pounded.\nOna was limp against the side of the hut, neither sitting nor lying down, the modules forced apart with her weight. In the purple glow of the docki stones he could see her eyes. They were open, staring at nothing.\nDesolate.\n\u201cOna,\u201d he said to her, \u201cOna, come back. I made the first kill.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t stir.\n\u201cI made the first kill\u2026\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHe sat for long periods, entranced by the pattern of wings in the sky. He thought of Ona\u2019s paper model, when she had tried to teach him about the desolation.\nBy late afternoon his ears hurt from the noise and he felt sick. No matter how many times his harpoon sprang into the air, he could not bring down a kill. The good-natured taunts soon dried up. The other men acted as though some contagious weird were upon him, and gave him a wide berth. With the sun dipping to the flat horizon, he reeled in his harpoon for the last time, and closed the lid.\nHe had hoped to give his Ona a reason to stir, to come back to him. Instead he faced only jibes from the women for returning empty-handed. Twilight swept across the plain as he approached the huts.\nA lightning-blue flame ignited in the midst of the village, fierce and bright. It roared high, a pillar of blinding light. Iblesh shielded his face, and dropped to a crouch. Women and children screamed.\nThe Burning One had come.\nIblesh dashed into the village, skirting the paper buildings. Odd rays and shadows played across the ground as the Burning One moved through. Iblesh came to the wide space where the tribe had feasted the night before, and saw the creature from his dreams, like a human cloaked in fire. The air was warped by the heat. The faces of the tribeswomen were small blue ovals, peering from the dark folds in the homes.\n\u201cIblesh!\u201d one of them yelled. It was Isylla, cowering, her eyes shining. \u201cDon\u2019t try to stop it!\u201d\nHando emerged from a hut. Iblesh thought for a moment that the Burning One had stirred him from his desolation. But he walked in a trance, like the diviner seeking the migration path. The Burning One came to him with arms outstretched. It laid glowing hands on him, and his flesh sizzled. The sky-blue flame erupted in a halo around Hando. There was a flash and Iblesh shielded his watering eyes. When he opened them again, a great pillar of fire rose out of the clearing, leaving a cascade of ash where Hando had stood, and browning the nearby walls.\nMahra, the mother of three, appeared on the far side of the clearing, her paper frock glowing blue in the weird light.\nThe Burning One was claiming the desolate.\n\u201cSomeone help,\u201d called Iblesh. \u201cIt\u2019ll kill her!\u201d\nNobody moved. A baby squealed from somewhere. He looked around the open space, expecting his Ona to appear, the third desolate victim. Iblesh felt the coiled weight of the harpoon in his hand.\nHis Ona would be next, after Mahra.\n\u201cIblesh!\u201d Isylla\u2019s voice tore the air.\nHe bolted across the clearing toward the Burning One. Two lighting blue eyes crackled in its white form, as the desolate woman was drawn to it. He knocked open the lid with his withered hand and felt for the catch with his thumb. His face burned as he drew near, his eyebrows crisped. He jammed the canister under its chin, the skin of his hands frying, and released the catch. The harpoon jettisoned, spiking through the top of its head.\nThe Burning One cannot be stopped.\nIt turned, scorching his body. He screamed. The flame reduced, and in the blue glow Iblesh could see the face of the Burning One.\n\u201cOna,\u201d he said.\nShe toppled backward into a hut, her head broken. The paper segments burst into flame at her touch. A corona of orange fire surrounded his grandmother, her body propped by the folded segments. She fell through, the structure ripping apart. Sheets of black and burning paper lifted on the waft of heat and scattered across the village.\nMahra stirred then, ripped from her desolation. The muscles on her arms and neck juddered and locked, her hands hooked, and she howled. She howled at Iblesh as though she were mad, and he the cause of it. She leapt at him, tore at his face. He stumbled back, kicking free of her. None of the women helped him. He fled the communal space, running into the endless twilight of the plain.\nHe understood Ona\u2019s lesson at last.\nIt cannot be stopped. It must be left alone.\nSome distance away, he turned to look. The tribesmen were returning in a rush from the hunt, and fighting the spreading blaze, stripping huts to the ground and stamping on smoldering embers. More children screamed. Pieces of paper, reduced to a grey ash, sifted through the village as light as ghosts.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThey asked him questions.\nThey asked him where he was going. He told them he didn\u2019t know, only that he was leaving his people behind. They asked if he left of his own will, and he did not reply. They asked him why he left, and he said that he had killed the Burning One, who gave his people release.\nHis eyes watched the yellow flames dance, and they soon stopped asking questions.\n\u2022\n\u00a9 2011 Miles Hurt, all rights reserved","source":null,"source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/rZ8u0-djKgMrD6yy94m7izJoFZg.json"}

They are also liminal: suffused with ambiguity, and hence opportunity. Think of this: a woman locks up a shop. It is early evening. It is dark and cool as she leaves the warmth and light of the premises. At the same time, she is comforted by the feel of the woolen scarf around her neck, brushing her skin, not because it warms her in the present, but because of associations with childhood \u2014 an adult caring for her, tucking her in, ensuring she is dressed properly, fussing, making her the center. Outside the door, there is the shock and reassurance of a new but familiar smell, the hint of wood smoke. She must turn to lock the door, so that she faces that which she is leaving. The keys mark her possession and control, but they are used only as she stands outside her domain. The street exists for traffic, but though her hands fuss with keys, on a macro level she is motionless with respect to the street itsel \u2014\nYes, I understand your impatience. You have lost an important man who was carrying a valuable item. You have film of him until just before he disappeared. Of course. If you had film of him after he disappeared, you would not be here.\nLook. A man wins the lottery. He is excited, this changes his life. What are the odds? Another man is a courier, who each week delivers a check to the latest lucky lottery winner. One man is leaping up and down, the other is a little bored. You see? Except, we are not bored \u2014 we enjoy our work.\nI shall get to the point.\nThe lady at her shop \u2014 this sort of event occurs all the time. This particular evening, though, is different. The energy of the city and a conspiracy of traffic lights throw up an attractor in the murmuration of commuters. It is one of those rare but real periodic pauses in busyness that, when they occur during a working day, may generate an otherworldly sense of peace and relief in those caught within their field.\nHowever, it is night. And another way of describing a lack of traffic is: an absence of witnesses. She hunches with keys at the door over the lock with her back to the street. Silent and unseen, a man stands behind her. He is very much within the boundary of her personal spa \u2014\nYou would move the event further on? Delay does not reduce liminality. A woman leaves a shop late at night \u2014 even more profound. Or, a woman does not leave the shop at all. Fearful, she remains after hours. She is in a place that is not meant to be occupied. The strange noises. Passing voices. What is a shop? A place for people to attend during business hours. But in the twilight afterwards, as the floor is swept, the money counted, stock returned to its place \u2014 a legitimate extension, but increasingly fraught. To push that boundary further though \u2014 have you never felt it yourself, in the office on the weekend, with nobody around, each ringing footstep a condemnation of your presence?\nDo you feel it now?\nTransformation by force: a man enters the shop at noon. He walks through the door to the tinkle of the bell. Once inside, he reaches around and throws the bolt of the lock. He twists the sign from Open to Closed. He faces the woman in the store as she stands alone \u2014 the power of the words \u2018in broad daylight\u2019.\nOthers with whom you have consulted \u2014 I know them, they do not know me \u2014 will express to you that categories are only a tool of modeling, that in fact all places are on a continuum. No. Transitions may occur over time, but is noon twilight? Is a full moon a new moon? For the person proffered a cup of tea by a sinister old lady, is there a spectrum between arsenic and cyanide? Please. Analysis requires rigor.\nOnce upon a time, there was a man. He walked down a corridor in a busy airport of a major city. No, this is an appropriate way to describe it. Yes, I will use such language in my report. Everything is a story, and we must not fool ourselves otherwise. He was a handsome prince, forced by circumstance to carry out a task he could not trust to a courtier. Over his shoulder he carried a battered and worn satchel. In this way he hoped he would not alert anyone that within there was treasure.\nSo then.\nThe prince walked a corridor devoid of doors. It is a utilitarian walkway. The wall on the left hid from view, in order: some toilets; a janitorial supply room; and a series of offices of airport personnel. These offices in turn fronted another corridor, access to which required a security card, and a tolerance for boredom. The wall on the prince\u2019s right was the back wall of inter alia, offices for several car hire agencies; a store selling metallic balloons and similar items to welcome weary travelers; and an information kiosk. All were entered from the front; none had a back entrance.\nNaturally in this information-rich age of terror, there was a security camera at each end of the corridor. The images from the camera in the east show the prince entering. We see the people who entered a few minutes before him, and those who entered a few minutes afterwards. From the west end camera, we see the same folk traipsing along and emerging at the exit. All except our prince.\nOf course we find this intriguing. We appreciate that for you, this is no cozy Agatha Christie locked room mystery. A prince and his treasure are missing. Heads and other body parts have been lopped. (The liminality of those places of parting, those dingy back rooms and midnight industrial areas!) Several organizations are on war footing. Rumbles normally subterranean are rising to the surface. But we are scientists. We must be dispassionate.\nThis is a First World country. Certifications are required. The security installers have passed certifications. There are stickers bearing dates and signatures. There can be no blind spot that is beyond the reach of the cameras. And there was not, at first. They were calibrated to overlap. Somewhere about the midpoint, we should be able to see the travelers from both cameras.\nWho is to blame? That question assumes agency, and human free will does not assume a position of prominence in our theories. Everywhere we make spaces, defining volume with our constructions. Modern glades within groves. Rows of pallets. Stacks of cardboard boxes. Office partitions. Crawlspaces. Alleys. Pipelines. Warehouses. Graves. Storm drains. Wardrobes. The special place between the floor and the bed. Lines of cornstalks, the spaces between the fields. These are the contributions of agriculture, civilization, industrialization, urbanization. None of these developments were in the interest of individuals. Hunter-gatherers were always healthier than their sedentary counterparts. Longer lives, better teeth, less parasites. Villages and towns were death traps and plague pits. Before the rise of agriculture, the only corridors our ancestors constructed were lanes to concentrate migrating flocks and herds of animals to fields of slaughter. What installed this desire in us to create abattoir corridors for ourselves?\nIf there is to be blame, look at the universe, with its physical laws. At any temperature above zero Kelvin, nothing is truly at rest. Brownian motion, the transfer of energy between particles. Over time, the camera mounts at each end of the corridor shifted slightly. It would have been detected eventually, there are inspections for such things. But until that happened, the result was a blind spot. We measured its length. For your prince, it was six steps long.\nWhy assume enemy action? What enemy of yours is subtle or smart enough?\nYes, we knew it would be something like this. In a massively over-surveilled high-technology world, where else would someone disappear, but in a blind spot?\nConsider: a woman walks home alone at night. She is grateful for the development of technology which means that her way is well lit. Electricity flows to the street lights above her head, installed by local authorities over many years. Expectations of these companies should not be high. After all, we see blunders at NASA and the NSA, which are much better resourced in PhDs and funds. The local agencies are purchased by conglomerations, wages are reduced \u2014 you see where I am heading. The lamps are not perfectly placed. Sometimes they are vandalized, or simply fail. The perverse result: gloom gathers like water in a deep pothole, for the darkness expelled from the other segments of her commute has been left a place to pool. When we dam, do we reduce the amount of water in the world? Not a jot. We simply increase the concentration of it in one area.\nSo then. The prince in the airport corridor. We have inspected the walls, the ceilings. There are no hidden exits, no rotating panels in the walls, no sign of disturbance in the structure, no challenges to the integrity of the fabric of the hallway. Our examination is thorough. There are no secrets.\nHmm, a conundrum. Come, let us reason together. The corridor is a continuum, just like a footpath: a series of stones placed in mud or water to ease traversal. The path is made up of the stones, not the spaces between. May I suggest for your consideration, an intersecting continuum, one composed of weakest links and blind spots? In the absence of perfect uniformity (see above: physical laws of the universe), there will always be a weakest spot in any system. Usually it will not matter \u2014 we are speaking relatively. The weakest spot may often be pretty damn strong. But here, a gap of six paces was enough.\nYou shake your head before I finish. What, do you picture the ceiling opening? Overhead tiles slid roughly across, the massive arms of a bull-headed man reaching down, crushing your prince to his huge leather chest to smother his screams? Do you think if there was just one more camera, you could have caught the image, and the mystery would be solved? You miss the point. The black hole of concentrated tenebrosity between the streetlights, where the shadows run thick and gather like molasses \u2014 it is denser darkness because of the streetlights. An extra streetlight would simply mean, this is not a place where the darkness gathers. But it would gather somewhere else. There is always a weakest link. And then the links are linked.\nSomething travelled through, passing from gap to gap, just as the handsome prince was there. Of course.\nIt is not a tiger. It is not just appetite and the transfer of energy from one creature to another. It is not an alien maw descending from the ceiling like an anaconda penis tipped with vagina dentata.\nIf the prince could be fished out of that oblivion, if he could be reconstructed from where he is spread over eleven dimensions, what could he tell you? The garbled meanderings of a tourist returned to Flatland from your world? See him stretched, ratcheted out of time, in a spectrum previously undreamed of. To capture all of that, well, that would be some security camera.\nPerhaps I am too harsh on our ancestors. Maybe it was all inevitable. Early hunters adopted for themselves paths they thought created by animals tracking to and from waterholes. And so it began. A reasonable assumption, if not always correct.\nRevert to the simple life. Lie naked in a field. Think yourself as safe as humans were before the first lean-to, the first crude copy of a cave scratched out of clay. But eventually you will fall asleep, and the dreams you dream are human constructions, tunnels through the mind and id: difficult to navigate, but the Minotaur is persistent.\nIf you were not bound and gagged \u2014 and if you were smarter \u2014 you might say something like, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. We agree. That is why we are here tonight, in this particular building. Yes, we know that it is owned by your organization \u2014 legend says that a very long time ago, our group commenced as a cabal of financial analysts, tracing the movements of funds and changes in ownership of property. The channeling of such a quantity of numbers is guaranteed to take you to esoteric and forbidding places.\nWe waited, analyzing the chaotic dynamics around a number of your properties. Increased traffic flow, divergence of aircraft overhead, a spike in wrong telephone calls, the birth of two-headed calves \u2014 all the classic indicators.\nDid you listen to the beginning of my report? Think of it: we stand unobserved \u2014 in your monitoring room. Unseeing eyes gaze at screens. We crunched the numbers, there were options. Not all of the scenarios required your men to die. They could have disappeared, but we have to be careful of our own disposition to irony. There is tradition, even for scientists. Spilled blood pays strange bills, and we have our fingers in so very many pies\u2026\nYou cannot see the monitors. They reveal pandemonium. Things crescendo. Earlier this evening, I said scientists must be dispassionate. Do not be mistaken \u2014 I do not lack passion. I am a romantic. I stand in awe of mystery.\nI need to know. I need to see. Even if imagination must fail, so that I could not even describe it to myself, even if I retain my identity for only a moment.\nShhh. Do not be afraid. You will not stare the gorgon in the face, I won\u2019t let that happen. That is the point of you. A king, helpless in his own castle. His royal blood spilled, like so. Betrayed by, well, a nobody. You understand \u2014 the liminality.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe noise of a door opening where there is no door. A draft ensues. Air moves to solidify. Shadows shift to make shape. The floor creaks to signify mass. I hear deep breathing two feet above my head, creating a sense of size.\nSomething is standing behind me, something passing through. I turn, to provide meaning. I have to see.\nplease find enclosed, for your earliest attention, our memorandum of fees for services rendered.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue30\/3lbe30_story2.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"Herewith, the results of our modeling\u2026 Tonight, we shall demonstrate that categories can be usurped by force for a most dramatic effect.

Once I drove into my old street I would cross a threshold, a change as monumental as when I left.\nThe council houses accreted on the village. I drove onto the verge, neglected turf smearing beneath the wheels. Plastic toys in the gardens gave the only flash of color, stark against beige fake brick cladding. No one peered out to see who was parking up. They knew better.\nI still had my key but checked in the letterbox anyway and wasn\u2019t surprised to find the spare gone. Inside, the air smelled of mildew. I turned on the immersion boiler, the electric fire and the kettle in that order. The water boiled. In the front room the glowing coiled wire scorched the dust that had settled since Dad went missing.\nFrom the kitchen window I could see the village, a nest of ancient buildings filled with rotting families who never had the sense to leave. At least they had a choice. No one left Kiln Close because they had nowhere to go.\nInside the fridge everything was rotten or on the turn. I made a cup of black tea and brought it to the living room. A transit van turned into the street, drove to the end, slowing as it passed, then circled around to leave. I moved close to the window so they could see me. The passenger stared as they drove by. They knew I was here. Saved me a job. In the kitchen I poured the cold tea down the sink.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThis hardness, this solidity, affected personalities. Made people inflexible. Made people go too far rather than admit they were wrong. Lot of blood spilt because some were not willing to say they were sorry. Like when Jamie reversed into the cornershop and refused to pay for the damage.\nThe paint scrapes matched. Bernie Houlder called in his cousins from Leeds. They weren\u2019t as inflexible as people around here. Willing to turn their hand to anything. Improvise. Any object can inflict pain if you\u2019re inventive enough. They used drills, angle grinders, and tools they found lying around that old barn far beyond the reach of any police.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBefore going in I paused by the door, reading posters for variety acts and fortune tellers. Spiritualists searching for the dead. There was no shortage of ghosts for them to find.\nInside, the air was thick with cigarette smoke. Government bans didn\u2019t apply in Slakeby. Beneath tables blind sheepdogs barked at the disturbance. I ignored them and the lone barman\u2019s stare, pushing through to the archway beyond and the pool room.\nUnder artificial light they were still holding court at the largest table as if nothing had changed since I\u2019d left. I dropped a pound coin near a pocket and pulled up a stool to wait.\nThe sound of shots ricocheting was the only noise. The three men in the corner supped their pints and stared, ignoring the game in progress. Foam dripped onto piles of bank notes.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not responsible,\u201d I said, not looking at any of them. \u201cThen you know who is.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s your game, lad,\u201d Billy Clapham said, nodding toward the pool table. \u201cWinner stays on.\u201d\nMy opponent was Jack, Billy\u2019s older brother. Before picking up the cue I touched my pocket, reassured by the hidden knife\u2019s weight. I grabbed the coin and tossed it in the air, caught it in my palm, flipping it against my wrist.\n\u201cYour call,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWinner breaks too,\u201d Jack said. I shrugged, slid the coin into the slot and waited as the balls tumbled through the hidden network of pipes, watching as he dropped them one by one into the triangle and split the pack.\n\u201cSomeone wrote me a letter. Told me he\u2019d gone missing.\u201d\n\u201cSomeone around here wrote? Must have gone to the grammar school,\u201d Billy said, a ripple of laughter going around the room. He handed his empty glass to one of his hangers-on, not handing over any money for the drink.\n\u201cYou stopping at his house?\u201d\n\u201cMy house now,\u201d I said. The trick was to not let them see they were getting to you. Turn your back on them. Make the cowardly fucks think you didn\u2019t care.\n\u201cCouncil might see it differently. Soon move some single mum in there,\u201d Billy continued. \u201cI\u2019d sort through his stuff. See what you want to keep before they skip it.\u201d\n\u201cWhere is he, Billy?\u201d\nJack potted the eight ball, took it out and set it back amongst the spread of reds and yellows.\n\u201cHaven\u2019t seen him in weeks,\u201d Billy said, absentmindedly flicking through the stack of money. \u201cMaybe he visited you in the big city and got lost. Mind hasn\u2019t been right for a long time.\u201d\nIgnoring Jack\u2019s cheating and Billy\u2019s pisstaking I took aim. Two reds went down and I lined up for the next. I listened to Jack\u2019s breathing behind me and hit the cue ball.\n\u201cWould be a good idea if we all walked out of here,\u201d I said. \u201cHow will you help me find him, if we all fall out now?\u201d\nJack looked at his brother and shrugged. Though he was older he never had the head for running the scams, even when we were all at school, stealing diesel and farm equipment. Apprenticeships for the family business.\nNo one said anything. Outside a truck passed by the pub, heavy wheels shuddering the walls. I took the next shot and unhooked the cue-rest from the rack on the wall.\n\u201cI thought the County Council banned trucks coming through the village,\u201d I said, leaning forward to sight down the cue.\n\u201cDepends who the trucks belong to,\u201d Billy said. \u201cForeign drivers. Don\u2019t take much notice of local rules.\u201d\n\u201cEspecially when they\u2019re working with you?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d he said. For a moment I thought he was going to say something else. His phone rang. I watched him ease it out, listen then stand up, gathering up the stack of money.\n\u201cWould be good if you were gone by the time we get back,\u201d Billy said.\n\u201cYou know that\u2019s not going to happen, Billy. My old man was never scared of you, and neither am I.\u201d\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t scared of us because of your old man. Things change.\u201d\n\u201cYes they do,\u201d I said, and watched them leave the pub.\nI walked out into the daylight. A second truck passed, side curtain too dirty to read. The slipstream opened my jacket to the cold Dales\u2019 air. I watched the truck navigate its way between the village buildings, barely skimming cornerstones on its way.\nThe Claphams didn\u2019t live in the village, though it was their little fiefdom\u2019s heart. The family was spread around several farms scattered across the Dale and the moors above. If the police ever did break their money-greased truce with the family any evidence would be long gone. If an urban crew decided to attack, somehow managing not to get lost across the moors, they would be swamped by family with a much better equipped arsenal. A lot of burnt-out cars found on the moors. Lot of dead bodies under the peat. How do I know? Because when I was younger my Dad tried to get me to follow in his footsteps. I learnt enough not to be intimidated and then left.\nBack to the house it was easy to tell they\u2019d been there by new splinters around the doorframe. Meant for me to see, of course. Inside, nothing had been tossed or turned over, but I smelt them on the air. The stench of dead sheep and sour beer. I turned on the fire, made myself a cup of tea, then sat on the sofa and closed my eyes.\nI decided to give them three days. The first day for them to laugh it off, the second day for them to plan and the third day for them to come for me.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI stood at the back window. A narrow road clung to the far side of the Dale. Motorbikes flicked between drystone walls, nipping past the tourist traffic and back into the correct lane. They saw the Dales as destinations and racing lines. I saw it as nets draped over the limestone and heather. Traps and knots for the unwary. Whether you were a sheep, shepherd or shop-owner, there were pockets of death in the country too easy to fall into.\nGetting out my knife I unfolded the blade and slid the tip into the discolored plastic at the base of the rotting tackle bag.\nPeople like the Claphams they think everyone is on the same intelligence level as them. What they had wasn\u2019t intelligence, but cunning. Take Dad for example. They knew he was fast and dangerous, but they never credited him with any brains.\nDad was smart. Never going to excel at school or go to university, but he was smart. The type of smart that kept him alive in the Dale for sixty years. I didn\u2019t know where he went wrong, but I knew where to look.\nThe book was slid between tackle bag\u2019s hard base and waterproof coating. I hooked it out and flicked back the red cover. Inside was filled with notes. Not the most detailed records, but the key information. Where the bodies were buried. Sometimes literally. I sat on the bed and read his precise handwriting, making a star next to the most important entries. Turning to the middle pages, a photo fell out. I picked it up off the carpet and turned it over to stare at the two figures who sat on the riverbank.\nAge had taken his face in the photo, but there was no mistaking my expression. Pride and love for the man who, despite all his faults, brought me up on his own after my mother died. Now the Claphams had taken him from me. I sat staring at the both of us until the sun set and I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt I was an orphan.\nI woke up in the early hours slumped on my old bed, notebook still in my hand. Opening my bag I turned on the mobile hotspot, connected my phone and began to photograph the pages, uploading them straight to the cloud.\nIt wasn\u2019t that the Claphams didn\u2019t acknowledge technology, just the ways of inflicting pain hadn\u2019t really changed in a couple of thousand years. They were traditionalists when it came to their working methods.\nIn 2015 they converted a barn to a studio and recruited camgirls to livestream 24\/7. Problem was the Claphams had a very conservative attitude to money. They tended to conserve it for themselves, and not want to share it with others. The girls left on a Sunday morning when the family were at Church, hotwiring an old stolen car hidden behind the cattle shed.\nOf course the brothers came back and sent out younger family members to look for them, but they were all gone by then. That was the closest they came to turning legitimate.\nOnce the photos were uploaded I tucked the original back in its hiding place and went downstairs.\nThe newspaper lying on the doormat hadn\u2019t been there when I arrived. Word gets around when someone\u2019s away and the local papergirl stops delivering. I picked it up and flicked on the hall light. It was the local rag, The Dales Courier. The date on the front was months ago, long before I found out I needed to return home. Out of habit I turned to Week in the Courts, then to the letters page.\nHe had a way with words, did Dad. Not a good way with words, but a way. I read the letter several times and sat down on the stairs.\n\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d I said, to the empty house. \u201cYou daft old fucker.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThey knew where to look in the house, so he never kept anything bulky at home. Once a week he drove to the nearby town, weaving through the streets until he reached the small block of prefabs. The garage cost him \u00a35 and change a week. For peace of mind to keep his memories away from those who would steal from him? Money well spent.\nHe only took me once. I came home late from college to find him drunk in the front room. He looked up from his bottle of vodka, grabbed me by arm and dragged me to his Land Rover.\nAt the garage he opened the door and by the headlight glare showed me all the old photos of mum. Photos of her in wedding dress and pictures and jeans. Some of her smiling and some scowling for him catching her unawares, but always with love. I never understood how he stayed whole when that part of him was torn away after he buried her. We never went back to the garage.\nA few times over the years I walked up to the door and stood outside, eyes closed, trying to taste those memories on the air. There were none for me to find. My mum died when I was too young to make my own memories. Apart from that drunken drive through the countryside my Dad never spoke about her.\nThe money must have still been paying the Council, the door still locked with the same padlock. I reached in my boot for a screwdriver, forced it behind the panel and wrenched it free. Security wasn\u2019t meant to stop thieves, just encourage them to look elsewhere.\nInside was stacked with box files. Those in back were crammed with the memories Dad didn\u2019t want infecting the rest of his life. Others in front were newer. I pulled the door partway down behind me and started flipping open the cardboard lids.\nSome were full of receipts, tax returns and accountant letters. Legitimate cover for illegal income. It didn\u2019t take me long to find what I was looking for. The County Council\u2019s replies were clipped to copies of letters he\u2019d sent them, every word written out a second time in his tight handwriting. I read them back and forth out of order until I could recite the discussion between him and the Transport and Streets department. With the letters spread like Tarot cards I held my head in my hands and closed my eyes.\n\u201cYou stupid old bastard,\u201d I said. There was no one left to hear apart from memories.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBilly picked up the documents and passed them to Jack without a glance.\n\u201cHe is a bit of an interfering old fucker, your old man. Always has been. You know that\u2019s why he ended up doing work for us? Saved Mags when some bloke was hassling her. The older boys were impressed with how he could handle himself. I knew he\u2019d eventually trip over his own fucking curiosity.\u201d\n\u201cI want to speak to Stan,\u201d I said. I stared at the glass-framed picture on the wall in front of me, the two idiots behind me thinking I couldn\u2019t see them.\n\u201cTell them to fuck off, Billy.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t? What if I have them drag you out, shatter your ankles, powder your wrists, and dump you on Lapwing Moor? What if that\u2019s how it plays out?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be trying to crawl back to civilization, and you\u2019ll be looking for a voicebox donor.\u201d\nHe looked down at the blade pressing against his throat and laughed.\n\u201cJack, give Stan a ring and see if he\u2019s up for a meeting.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t move, still holding the knife in place. Jack dialed a number, said something I didn\u2019t quite hear and passed me the phone.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI stepped up into the Transit van\u2019s cab, kicking some space for my feet.\nWe drove in silence through low fields until the road rose up the Dale side, across the moor to a cottage by itself in the middle of nowhere. Out of curiosity I checked my phone signal. The only signals out here were geese cleaving through the sky above us.\nOf course I\u2019d asked to take my own car. That was not open for negotiation and I needed to lose the battles not worth winning to stand a chance of making it out again.\nBilly parked on the lane with the engine running.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you going to drive all the way up?\u201d I said.\n\u201cNah. If he shoots you, I don\u2019t get caught in the crossfire.\u201d\nClimbing out I tried to keep Billy in sight while also watching the cottage for an ambush. There was no cover on the moor. Nowhere to hide. Like all Clapham places, anyone inside could see people approaching from miles away.\nI walked through the small garden planted with neat rows of vegetables, knocked on the door, and waited\nStan was Billy and Jack\u2019s uncle, but there was little family resemblance. While the brothers were both tall and muscular, spending as much time in the gym as in the cattle shed, Stan was compact and wiry as any Dale\u2019s tree, skin worn and marked with scars earned over the years in the fields and car park fights.\n\u201cJoe isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nI nodded.\n\u201cCome in. You\u2019re letting heat escape. Fire\u2019s a bugger to get right when it goes out.\u201d\nI followed him into the cottage, past the kitchen with its range and into the sitting room.\n\u201cTea?\u201d He said, gesturing for me to sit down.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I said. For a few minutes the room was quiet apart from the fire, and Stan coughing into his hand as he worked around his kitchen making the drinks. Finished, he sat down in the armchair by the fire, took a sip and put the cup down on the hearth.\n\u201cBilly tells me you\u2019re looking for your old man.\u201d\n\u201cHe went missing and someone wrote to me. Seems he contacted the Council about the trucks going through the village.\u201d\nStan nodded and reached for a packet of tobacco, rolling himself a cigarette and lighting it before speaking again.\n\u201cYou know, in the early eighties your Dad was the best tobacco smuggler we had. Never got stopped by Customs and Excise,\u201d he said, inhaling a lungful of smoke and blowing it toward the yellowed ceiling. \u201cAlways an interfering bastard though. Always wanting to know what was going on. More than once I had to convince Keith and Alan he wasn\u2019t a grass. Turns out I was wrong.\u201d\n\u201cCome on Stan, where is he? He was complaining about the noise from the trucks going through the High Street, not calling in the fucking drug squad.\u201d\n\u201cHe brought the Council\u2019s attention to the amount of traffic. Started talking about petitions and press. Where the press goes, the law follows.\u201d\n\u201cJust tell me where he is, so I can give him a decent burial. I\u2019m not going to go looking for revenge on you lot am I?\u201d I lied. \u201cHow many of you are there compared to me?\u201d\n\u201cNot as many as there used to be,\u201d Stan said, shifting around in his chair. \u201cWhen I were a kid, I had eight brothers and sisters. Two more died as young \u2019uns. Today, you\u2019re struggling to get families to squeeze out one kid, never mind ten.\u201d\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t someone have had a quiet word with him? He was stubborn, but wasn\u2019t unreasonable.\u201d\nStan shook his head and drained his cup in one, chucking the dregs into the flames. He stared at the row of photos on the mantelpiece. The first, black and white, showed a wedding party outside a church door, hair sprinkled with monochrome confetti. The second, the same couple a bit older sat on the sands at Bridlington, toddlers playing around their feet. The third was a long photo showing over fifty people, at the center the same couple still holding hands.\n\u201cYou miss her, don\u2019t you? Margaret. You still miss her,\u201d I said.\nStan nodded and carried on looking at the mantelpiece.\n\u201cEvery single day,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery single day.\u201d\n\u201cSo you know how I feel. I don\u2019t have a wife, or kids, or a mother. I just had my Dad. The least you can do is let me know where he is.\u201d\nThere was a silence. For a moment I thought I\u2019d pushed too hard. Dug in too deep trying to find some humanity left in the worn-out old man in front of me. Don\u2019t get me wrong. He wasn\u2019t weak or broken, just he\u2019d drank too much of the hills over the years. More stone than person.\n\u201cFrom what I understand, someone did go to talk to him.\u201d\nI leant forward, keeping my hands on my lap.\n\u201cWho?\u201d\nThere was no need to be aggressive with someone like Stan. He either told you, or he didn\u2019t. If he didn\u2019t there was nothing you could do. You could burn him or scald him. Pour bleach in his eyes, or cut him to pieces inch by bloody inch. Even in his seventies he\u2019d keep his mouth shut.\n\u201cJack.\u201d\n\u201cThey sent Jack to negotiate with someone? Not Billy or Samuel? Not even Sarah.\u201d\n\u201cJoe, I don\u2019t make decisions any more. I\u2019m seventy-four fucking years old. I\u2019ve spent decades in fields either tending beasts or moving crop. I\u2019m old. My body is shagged. I just to want to sit by the fire, smoke fags, and have a pint on a Friday night.\u201d\nI knew he was lying, and he knew he was lying. What could I do?\n\u201cGet them to take me out to him. That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking. Let me give him a proper burial. At least let me have somewhere to visit when I come back.\u201d\nI let him think. I could try and kidnap him, force them to take me to Dad. There was no way I could get him off the moor. Billy was still in the van outside, watching the door very closely. Instead I watched this old man weigh alliances and favors in his head until he nodded.\n\u201cSend the lad in. Tell him I need to chat to him about the lethera tups.\u201d\nOutside, Billy listened carefully.\n\u201cSay it again,\u201d he said, leaning against the van.\nI did, speaking exactly the same phrase for a second time.\n\u201cWait in there. I\u2019ll be out after I\u2019ve spoken to him.\u201d\nInside the van I watched mist steam up the window and ran a finger through the moisture. I wondered if they gave Dad the luxury of sitting up front, or if they bound him and chucked him in the back like unwashed fleece.\nBilly came back out, opened the driver\u2019s door and climbed in, spitting into the dirt outside like he was sealing a deal with the moor itself.\n\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m sorry about what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cJack can go off on one. I was on a job. I just wanted him to talk to your Dad.\u201d\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you.\u201d\nWe drove in silence, Billy concentrating on the road and me just concentrating. Out on the moor there wasn\u2019t even a radio signal to break up the quiet. We left the made road and drove down a dirt track barely visible in the dark. Billy kept the lights off, driving by instinct as much as knowledge.\n\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\n\u201cTo find your old man.\u201d\n\u201cAnd where is he?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see when we get there,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIs this the only route?\u201d\nEven in the dark I saw him roll his eyes.\n\u201cYou can go by road, but from Stan\u2019s place this is quicker.\u201d\nI shut up then. We carried on, the van chucking one way and another as he tried to negotiate the wheel ruts scarring the moor.\nReaching the moor edge, the track tipped forward and we jagged our way down until we hit tarmac once more. Billy paused and wiped his face with a cloth he pulled from under the seat.\n\u201cLast stretch is always a bit hairy,\u201d he said, as if we were friends on a fishing trip.\nI said nothing and he shrugged, setting off again into the distance. The van rounded a corner and stopped at a break in the hill.\nI climbed out and followed him through the quarry entrance, skirting the rusted-in-place barrier. The quarry was vast, big enough to fit the village. From side to side it was filled with freight containers, stacked so high it was unclear how they\u2019d all been lifted into place. Most were so rusted the company logos decorating their corrugated sides were faded beyond reading.\n\u201cWelcome to the graveyard,\u201d Billy said. Something in his voice told me he wasn\u2019t talking about the containers.\nI followed him further in. Jagged walls of metal hid the quarry face beyond.\nWhat is this place?\u201d I said.\n\u201cA quarry,\u201d he said, searching his pockets for a packet of tobacco.\n\u201cThe containers?\u201d\nSome looked decades old, rotting amongst the moors. Others were fresh. I recognized the curtain side from the truck in the village.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve expanded a bit since you left. More contacts in the cities. Turns out they\u2019re mostly families like us. Sometimes they need people disappearing. We\u2019re very good at making people disappear.\u201d\n\u201cYou just load them up and unload the containers here?\u201d\n\u201cNo one really paid attention. Apart from your dad.\u201d\nBilly stopped talking then, scanning the stacks of metal boxes. In the silence I noticed the reek of decay seeping from the stacks around us.\n\u201cOver there,\u201d he said, pointing to a container on its own, door closed with hasp and padlock.\nI followed him over trying to keep in his blindspot. He hadn\u2019t survived this long by stupidity.\n\u201cStand over there,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere I can see you. Come close and I\u2019ll perforate you and leave you on High Street as a warning.\u201d\nI said nothing but moved to the patch of dirt he indicated. He kept me in sight and fished a key out of his pocket, unfastening the lock. I should have known when he fumbled the task, almost dropping the key on the floor, and swearing under his breath. I thought it was just nervousness. Being there alone with me. He pocketed the padlock and gestured me over.\nFlicking back the clasps, I held the metal handle and pulled, the bar turning and flexing the door out. As soon as the smell hit me, I knew, dropped my hand into my pocket for the knife, swung left and cut through fabric and skin.\nThe blow knocking me from my feet came from the right. I tasted grit and oil as I fell, my open mouth scraped across the gravel. A boot stamped on my kidneys then my spine, another smashing down on my hand separating the bones from each other inside my skin. I screamed. The kicks continued. Something heavy and metal and cold caught me on the back of the knees, and I heard rather than felt the tendons tear. Then the boots started once more, stamping on my back and my neck until I blacked out.\nThe sound of chains woke me. I tried to sit up but the floor was cold metal and comforting. A splinter of light came between the doors, then I heard rattling above and the world tilted. The container began to slowly spin and I was thrown into a far corner, the taut chains above lifting it off the ground.\nThe second concussion took me out for what seemed like hours. I searched my pockets for my phone, staring at the display through the shattered screen. The kicking or the movement of the container had smashed it up. I watched the battery level fade quickly followed by the display.\nThere was no movement outside. I gave my eyes a moment to adjust to the darkness. Somewhere above me, standing water had rusted the steel to knives and dripped through to collect in the metal gaps. I crawled over and cupped the liquid in my hands, lapping it out of my palms, trying to ignore the taste of metal and paint.\nMy thirst was barely touched and my torn body ached. I leant against the wall and tried to collect myself. Let my eyes adjust a little more. Let my other senses follow. Enough air was coming through for me to smell the quarry and the Dales beyond. The mixture of limestone dust and diesel. Peat and the wind whipping over drystone walls. I was not here to be suffocated, but forgotten.\nI noticed my Dad soon after, fallen over in the corner where he had once been propped up. To start with I ignored him. Paying any attention would mean accepting the reality of where I was. Accepting what had happened. For the next couple of hours I just sat and stared, as if looking for signs of life. Not daring to approach in case he wasn\u2019t alive, or maybe in case he was. Then, hating the sound of my own breathing, I started talking.\n\u201cYou fucking idiot,\u201d I said. My voice sounded too loud in the container, steel walls reflected back the anger and amplified it. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you just leave well alone? Why couldn\u2019t you just keep out of their business?\u201d\nI wanted to grab his body and smash it against the walls. Make him fight back, even as I knew that wasn\u2019t possible. Instead I spent the day perched in the far corner in silence, staring across and willing him to speak. Willing him to be faking, or to be in a coma. The only breath I heard was my own.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe hunger came on the second day. I was able to ignore it for three days. On the fifth day everything changed.\nI took out my knife and untucked his T-shirt. The blade slid easily into the flesh above his belt and I cut up, peeling a strip away to expose the fat below, then again down to the ribs. The knife caught on bone as I sawed and the friction filled the container with the stench of burning.\nHarvesting the meat from his torso meant my transgression was hidden under his clothes. I pulled down the T-shirt once more, pushing it back into his waistband.\nThe muscle and fat just sat in my hand until I could think of it as food. Hunger helped. Before the sun went down I\u2019d chewed my first mouthful and taken the knife to his dead body once more.\nI tried to ignore the meat\u2019s source as I ate. Fooling myself that it was cattle left to die in the container. Chewing, I tasted the grit of the land in each mouthful and felt it settle in my stomach. I had spent many years eating food not tainted by the mark of stone. Now the flesh I needed to eat to survive was infecting me once more.\nExposed ribs were narrow windows of butchery divulging the lie beneath the skin. Each time I cut down his flanks, steel caught on bone and something deep inside the corpse rattled. I reached into his chest cavity, pushed my fingers between tar filled lungs, and pulled out his heart. The organ sat in my hands, shrunken and crusted with stone, snapped off from the rest of his body where blood vessels could no longer support the extra weight. I turned the petrified organ over in my hands, the weight of the hills raw against my palms. In that moment I knew that I could gnaw out every grain of marrow and it would make no difference. My body would rot to dust in this metal coffin. With the last bit of rage, I weighed the heart in my hand and smashed in the face I could not see, just to stop his dead eyes looking. When I\u2019d recovered from the exertion I started to harvest once more.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI listened to him shut the van door, and fuss outside, taking off the lock and opening the container. I waited until he stepped inside before hitting him with the lump of stone that was Dad\u2019s petrified heart. He fell and though I was ready for a fight, the impact with the container\u2019s metal floor shattered his skull. I dragged him inside before I began to butcher him. The knife slid through his muscle easier than into my father\u2019s withered corpse, the dulling edge separating strips of meat from his bones. What I couldn\u2019t eat I hung up to dry in the container.\nThe van keys must have been lost in the struggle, but it doesn\u2019t matter. I found the padlock keys in Billy\u2019s pocket. It will take me a while to work out which keys open which containers. I have no need to go anywhere. All the food I need is in the metal boxes stacked around the quarry, dried out by the still air. I weigh my Dad\u2019s heart in my hand, place it on the floor beside the remains of his corpse and step out into my stolen kingdom.\n\u2022\nFront & Back cover art by Rew X\n\u2022\nJulie Ireland\nBear Weiter\nCraig Church\nKelly L.\nJessica Guptill\nThomas Ha\nMaria Haskins\nLorna D.

The Hecate Centuria was only ever deployed on direct order from the goddess Hecate herself.\nYet another centurion howled in victory; from her place of concealment Dematria shuddered at the thought of what atrocity could have motivated the outburst. Already, she had seen at least seven of her sisters savagely torn apart by Hecate\u2019s lupine soldiers.\nThere was only one thing another god could want from Venera: the goddess\u2019s sacred fires. As long as the holy flames were kept alive and within city limits, the goddess and her eponymous city were as one, each of them an aspect of the other. The sacred fires could also infuse mundane matter with a spark of divinity, hence vermilion\u2019s potency. For someone with the proper training, for someone who knew the sacred rites of the goddess, vermilion could be much more than the simple recreational drug most used it as.\nHidden she may be among the wax statues of the Platea Theatrum, atop a slight rise that gave her an unobstructed view of the eastern shore and of the heart of city \u2014 whose most recent face had been overseen by the Pompeian exile Maria Vitruvia, outdoing by far the decadent Campanian metropolis for the gaudy eroticism of its architectural detail; the goddess Venera encouraged indulgence in carnal and sensual delights, and the architecture of her city reflected her predilections \u2014 but Dematria knew it was only a matter of time before the centurions caught her scent and hunted her down.\nDematria weighed her options. There was a chance she might survive if she went underground and lost herself among the layers of history and prehistory beneath the modern city of Venera; there was a hidden opening to the tunnels a mere hundred steps from where she stood \u2026 if she could reach it without being detected. Or she could make her way to the sacred altar where burned the goddess\u2019s holy flames, where perhaps, with the proper ritual, Venera might grant her the divine attributes necessary to save the city \u2014 an option that carried not only an increased risk of discovery but the potential of leading the enemy to the very secrets they desired to wrest from the goddess. Or Dematria could reveal her presence to the invaders and let herself be slaughtered by the changeling centurions, eliminating any danger that she might carelessly betray her city-goddess. Or the priestess could simply do nothing, stay hidden, and hope that she survive the carnage.\nOr she could inhale the last of her stash, pray to Venera, and perhaps the plans of the city-goddess might then be revealed to her.\nChoice was taken away from her: two of Hecate\u2019s man-wolves were now sniffing around the piazza, converging upon her. Quickly, she snorted the rest of her vermilion, hoping at least that it would numb the pain of the inevitable brutal assault.\nThe heavy dose of the holy spice made her lose control of her sensory input. Dematria could barely hold on to even her sense of self. No longer aware of the material world, she was thrust into the presence of the goddess Venera, became one with the object of her worship. Dematria hoped to fathom if the goddess had any plans to save the city, but the deity \u2014 like her Earthly alter ego, the city-state that bore her name \u2014 was under attack. Venera was locked in combat with the divine she-wolf, the goddess Hecate herself. Dematria did not so much see as intuit the conflict; the gods could not be reduced to mere visual representation. Hecate remained locked in her lupine attribute, and Dematria recoiled at the savageness of the invading deity, at the assault of ethereal claws and fangs; Dematria marshalled her courage, struggled to remain calm and silent; she dared not distract her matron goddess, lest she unwittingly give an advantage to the aggressor Hecate.\nSharp physical pain pulled Dematria back to the material world, back to the Platea Theatrum. One of the centurion wolves had attacked her. He had gone for her neck, but even in her vermilion trance Dematria had reflexively blocked the assault with her forearm.\nThey were both on the ground now, the wolf\u2019s jaws clamped on her arm, tearing it to shreds. The second wolf hung back, observing the fight and protecting his fellow centurion\u2019s flank.\nDematria\u2019s blood covered the wolf-soldier\u2019s snout, filled his mouth. The divine attributes of vermilion extended her consciousness. She was one with her shed blood as it flowed down the wolf\u2019s throat, as her blood became one with the wolf.\nDematria herself became one with the wolf. Her desperate, vermilion-enhanced consciousness overwhelmed that of the overconfident and obedient soldier\u2019s, and she now commanded the changeling\u2019s body. With her newfound canine senses, heightened by the holy spice, she detected that the other wolf smelled that something was amiss with his fellow centurion. She could not afford to wait.\nBefore the other wolf could be fully on guard, Dematria set upon him and tore at his throat until he lay dead before her.\nWith wolf eyes, she looked back at her bleeding, savaged human body; it had precious little life left. Her consciousness would fade once her original body expired. There was no time to waste.\nThis wolf body had escaped unscathed from that first confrontation with another wolf. She knew she could not always be so fortunate. The Hecate Centuria was a full hundred soldiers strong. She had possessed one and killed a second. That was only two.\nWith a last sniff at her dying human vessel, Dematria howled at the full moon and set out to hunt the ninety-eight remaining werewolves.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue23\/3lbe23_story4.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"In the light of the full moon, her vision enhanced by vermilion, Dematria watched in horror as Hecate's changeling centurions terrorized her beloved goddess-city, Venera.

She felt the electric stare before her eyes connected with him. A lanky man, with an ash-green pallor stood taller than everyone else. He watched her casually as he sucked on a cigarette. Everything about him felt out of place: his faded camo pants, his gator skin biker vest over the too-big Old Navy T-shirt, his gray hair tied in a long braid falling over the scales and scutes of his vest like a cascade over glistening black rocks, his indifference at the emergency vehicle.\nHis golden eyes, cool and steady, made her look away. She wanted to recede into herself. She hated the instinct, so she kept walking until she reached her driveway. Was it her driveway? Maybe she had the wrong house and this was all a stupid mistake.\nDemi lived in a small boxy home built in the \u201960s. It looked like every other house in West Hialeah, only hers was painted a tranquil green, like aged jade. The bottom half had been decorated with a tan and onyx stone veneer. At this time in the day the western side felt the shade of a medium-sized mango tree growing in their perfectly manicured front lawn. But the flashing ambulance reds and whites threw off her sense for a moment. Then the front door opened and her mother waved her in, eyes damp and red, mouth pursed into a tight beak.\nDemi went numb. She ran her hand over her sweaty short hair, peeled off her backpack and dropped it and the skateboard on the grass. Then, after realizing she had to move, she hurried to her mom. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d she croaked.\n\u201cAyap\u00e1,\u201d was all her mother managed to say.\nHer grandfather. Had he fallen trying to knock down the high mangoes? Had he finally cut himself on the machete he kept under his pillow? \u201c\u00bfPero que paso?\"\nMom enfolded Demi in her thick soft arms and pressed her close. Her permanent aroma of oily cooking and fresh linens obliterated all traces of the ambulance exhaust. \u201cAy, Demi, Ayapito is dead.\u201d\nDemi waited for the inevitable tears. Her throat closed up and her face twisted, but none came. She clung to her mom and barely noticed when she was pulled inside and the door shut.\nFrom their living room they could see Ayapito\u2019s room, it had been the garage a long time ago. Through the door she saw her grandmother Yeya hovering behind the two burly paramedics, answering questions in Spanish. Every minute or two her grandmother took off her big tortoiseshell glasses, wiped them on her floral housedress, and propped them back on her nose. Her father sat on the sofa, face in hands, crying like a baby. Ayap\u00e1 was his father, or great great grandfather, or something.\n\u201cBut \u2026 but how can he be dead?\u201d she whispered into her mother\u2019s neck, still holding on. \u201cHe\u2019s like a thousand years old? A thousand three-hundred!\u201d\n\u201cShhh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d her mother said, rubbing her back. \u201cThese things happen.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a trick? He\u2019s just messing with us.\u201d Her grandfather was the most immature person she knew. One time, he hid under Abuelita Yeya\u2019s bed and nearly gave her a heart attack when he snatched her ankle just as she settled in for the night. He laughed so hard he nearly gave himself a heart attack too.\n\u201cNo, mija, they checked him.\u201d\n\u201cBut what did he die of?!\u201d Demi shouted at the EMTs, pulling back from her mom.\nOne of them, the youngest of the pair with shaved arms and diamond earrings, said, \u201cWe don\u2019t know, but probably just old age. He passed in his sleep.\u201d\nThat made no sense to her. How could an ancient spirit suddenly die?\nThen, with no effort at all, the paramedics lifted Ayap\u00e1. The small frail body, with its wrinkled skin the color of coffee and fluffy white hair, sailed to the stretcher. This was not her hero. No scintillating ash\u00e9 rolled off of him like waves on a sunlit lake. This was an empty shell.\nThey covered grandfather with a sheet, gave Yeya instructions, and wheeled him away. For an instant, her home buzzed with a deafening underwater quiet. Then, Demi\u2019s body spasmed, her chest tightened. She sucked in a big breath and crumpled to the floor. She hugged her knees tight and sobbed, trying to compress her entire being into her chest, letting her ancestral predisposition take over.\n\u201cEso es mentira!\u201d her father yelled suddenly, breaking her grieving. \u201cAyapito didn\u2019t die in his sleep. He was murdered!\u201d\n\u201c\u00a1Alfredo c\u00e1lmate!\u201d her mother shouted.\nYeya puttered in the kitchen, wringing her hands and shaking her head. She never got involved when Mami and Papi argued.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me to calm down, Lydia! I know it was that gringo boya who suddenly showed up. Ese hijueputa slipped into our lake in the middle of the night and got him. \u00bfQue carajo is he even doing in Hialeah?\u201d\n\u201cI think Papi is right.\u201d Demi emerged from behind her knees, anger bubbling inside her. She had her father\u2019s temper. \u201cI saw him too. He was outside right now, glaring at me. He wasn\u2019t human, but I wasn\u2019t sure.\u201d\n\u201cAy, Dios Santo. We should go. I should text T\u00eda Magali.\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Demi and her father snapped in unison. He took a breath and regarded her, half annoyance and half pride.\nEveryone fell silent.\n\u201cJust because we carry our homes on our back,\u201d she continued. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean moving away when things get bad! We always do that! We should stay and fight this guy.\u201d\nEveryone gaped at her now, even Yeya poked her head out of the kitchen.\n\u201cNo,\u201d her father said soberly, wiping away tears and spittle with his sleeve. He looked a bit like Ayapito, only fatter, more diminished somehow. \u201cHe\u2019s too powerful. That boya will crack our backs with those jaws of his.\u201d\nThe scraggy man hadn\u2019t looked very impressive to Demi. \u201cWe\u2019re powerful too,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m the Princess of the venerable Jicotea tribe. I\u2019ll fucking do it myself!\u201d\n\u201cNo comas mierda, Demi.\u201d Her father growled at her. \u201cThis isn\u2019t one of your cartoons. Your title doesn\u2019t mean shit in this country. We left all that behind in Cuba.\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019m a turtle spirit in human form!\u201d\n\u201cMe too. Big deal. I still have to get up at 5:40 in the morning, go to work and pay the bills.\u201d He hoisted his bulk from the sofa and pointed a stubby finger at her. \u201cNo te metas, Demi. Just go back to your AP classes and catching Pok\u00e9mon or whatever it is you do on your phone. There\u2019s nothing you can do about Ayap\u00e1. He\u2019s died before. Now, I need to think!\u201d Her father huffed into his room and slammed the door.\nShe winced. The only sound in the house was the blood pumping behind Demi\u2019s ears and Yeya banging around in the kitchen, whispering on the phone.\nHer mother lightly touched her shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s just upset.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m upset.\u201d\n\u201cI know, mi amor.\u201d She kissed the side of her head. \u201cSince we\u2019re not leaving, you should get ready. The family is going to start showing up.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDemi just sat there, clenching and unclenching her fists, grinding her teeth. Her mother set a plate of croquetas and a cold can of Sprite next to her, but she barely noticed. Her eyes were on the water. She loved this lake. It was the reason her parents had bought this house in the first place. She often did homework or read by its shore. She swam in it every summer \u2014 and it was always summer in Florida. She had even hatched in that sandy spot underneath the dancing areca palms and had followed the moon into its lapping embrace. So she could tell that something was wrong.\nIt was subtle things like the nervous way the great blue heron tiptoed around its edge; or that drifting log, that-wasn\u2019t-a-log, appearing and disappearing out of the corner of her eye; or that among this gathering of a hundred totemic aquatic turtles, all of them politely avoided the water as if it were made of acid. An evil spirit had intruded into her little kingdom and Demi burned with indignation.\nThe boya had crushed her grandfather in its maw. She knew from all the folk tales that animal spirits retained their bestial proclivities, predators hunted prey for their ash\u00e9. What if it went after her father next? Or her mother? Or the neighbor\u2019s two-year-old son she\u2019d seen splashing and giggling in the water last week? Poor cute, unsuspecting, woefully-human William. She had to do something.\nDemi\u2019s entire life had been that of a mortal girl, but she wasn\u2019t mortal, or even a girl. She was the Jicotea Princess and no matter what her father said, that had to count for something. Maybe not here in the material world of bills and final exams, but beneath the thin algal membrane that separated the surface and fluid realms, her heritage would matter. All of Apayito and Yeya\u2019s stories came surging back like tears and bile. Many millennia of arcane histories woven in with disastrous ballet classes and tantrums at Target, trips to Disneyworld and driving lessons that ended in shouting.\nThe turtles\u2019 susurrations suddenly cut out and Demi turned to see a giant tortoise crossing from the neighbor\u2019s yard. It was more statuesque than any Gal\u00e1pagos cousin, with cheerful marigold scales on its neck and legs and a vibrant green, almost turquois, shell adorned with vermillion starbursts. A jewel the size of a boulder. It stepped over the other guests with great solemnity and dignity, each move like an exhausted parent navigating their sleeping child\u2019s bedroom. Demi watched it make its laborious journey all the way to her lawn chair. She knew she should stand or curtsy in its presence, maybe even bow, but the sight of it dazzled her into impropriety.\nIt dipped its elongated neck and said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for your loss, your highness.\u201d It pipped like a small bird or frog.\nYour highness. Demi wanted to roll her eyes and sneer, but she controlled her adolescent pesadeses. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said instead.\n\u201cI will miss Ayap\u00e1 very much.\u201d She couldn\u2019t tell if this being was male or female. It probably ceased to matter or care long ago.\n\u201cMe too.\u201d\n\u201cYou know, I was at your parent\u2019s wedding.\u201d The other guests inched closer to hear this flamboyant brontosaurus speak. \u201cIt was quite the event. The king and queen of the Jicotea tribe. A union between two royal families, one from Africa and one from the Americas. I danced with Ayapito all night long. I believe the island of Cuba shifted a whole millimeter with all my gyrations.\u201d Ah, it was female. There was a smile somewhere in all the jaundiced wrinkles. The tortoise closed her eyes and swayed her considerable bulk to the bittersweet bachata now on the radio.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all over now.\u201d Demi drew her legs close and bit her bottom lip. Her father\u2019s words still stung. She knew nothing of that glorious past. She couldn\u2019t imagine him as a young king perched on a moss-covered throne. They had left all that in Cuba when they\u2019d came to Miami. All she knew was that he had gone to jail for a couple years and when he got out, they fled.\nThe painted tortoise nodded slowly. \u201cYes, there\u2019s lots of sacrifice in exile.\u201d\nDemi waited patiently for her to continue, but she never did. Lost in thought, remembering the protracted laundry list of sacrifices. This was the soul of a long-extinct species, after all. She endured in the spirit world only because turtles the world over still sang of her splendor. Demi understood that simply by gazing into the constellations on her back. She had once been a real turtle, native to an atoll ground down by geologic forces, but she looked more like a shamanic vision than the actual product of evolution.\nThen some asshole honked their horn and everyone jumped, including Demi. The heron flapped away, squawking. The mourners ducked into their shells. Even the antediluvian tortoise with its imposing size cowered within her pretty bunker. Fear stuck to everything like mud.\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d Demi shot up from her lawn chair, knocking over the now-warm can of soda. Round, wizened heads cautiously emerged from quivering carapaces. \u201cI\u2019m going to stop this shit right now.\u201d\nAfter that, everything blurred. Her heart boomed in her chest, her cheeks sizzled. She went inside, ignoring all questions and concerns from her people-shaped family and raged into her room. \u201cD\u00e9jala,\u201d she heard one of her uncles say. \u201cIt\u2019s hitting her really hard.\u201d She kicked off her sneakers, peeled off her socks, shirt and pants. Then fished her vintage Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle T-shirt from the closet and pulled it on with the care of a warrior donning enchanted armor. Demi fought the urge to glance in the mirror, one look at her pudgy countenance and she\u2019d lose all nerve.\nShe crossed her home again, wearing nothing but the ebullient green shirt and panties. This time no one said anything as she burst into Ayapito\u2019s room. The trace of his musky cologne permeated the air. His dead cells coated everything like dust. The black-and-white photos on the dresser, the unread El Nuevo Herald \u2026 it almost knocked the air out of her. She felt a powerful impulse to jump onto his bed and weep. Instead, Demi leaned in, snatched his machete from its sacred resting place and swished it around like a katana.\n\u201cYou remind me of him.\u201d\nDemi wheeled around to find Yeya standing there in her floral housedress, eyes red and wet from tears. She had applied red lipstick for the guests. In her blind determination Demi had almost nicked her abuelita with the blade. When had she cried? The old lady was tougher than all of them \u2014 had taken charge in the midst of calamity.\n\u201cHe especially would have appreciated the shirt. Como le encantaba ver mu\u00f1equitos contigo.\u201d\nInstantly Demi got a flash of her grandfather, incandescent smile, if\u00e1 gleaming in one eye and mischievousness in the other, maybe dancing with a too-big tortuga. \u201cDon\u2019t try and stop me, Yeya.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d her voice gave a bit. She smelled like sea spray, not from the tacky body splashes they sell in stores, but the ageless briny, salty stench of tide pools. Her eyes wandered to a photo of her grandfather \u2014 in his less-ancient days \u2014 grinning shirtless under a palm in Varadero. Her grandmother used to joke that you couldn\u2019t tell who was skinnier, Ayapito or the palm tree.\nOf course, she loved him. Yeya was her mother\u2019s mom. She wasn\u2019t married to Ayapito. Her husband had died long ago in Baracoa during the Revolution, but Demi knew that when the moon was full and the spiced rum flowed he would sneak into Yeya\u2019s room \u2014 and not just to scare her. Sometimes, Demi would hear old Cuban Son emanating through her locked door. An attempt to drown out the rhythmic scrape of keratin plates, the moaning and groaning, the laughing and playful pillow talk. She would call him \u00ccj\u00e0p\u00e1, as he was known in Yorubaland, and he would reverently refer to her as Caguama, mother of all Ta\u00edno people. Two royal houses coming together. It used to gross her out, but now Demi found it unbearably sweet, and, as Ayapito used to say, \u201cYou can\u2019t tell an old turtle from a young one.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of you, Demi.\u201d Her grandmother shut the door behind her. \u201cNo le hagas caso a ese Papa tuyo. Your title is not decorative. Your responsibility to your tribe is very real.\u201d\n\u201cThat colorful tortoise out there seems to think so.\u201d\nA hint of jealously flared in her grandmother\u2019s eyes. \u201cYes, there\u2019s still wisdom in esa vieja gorda.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Yeya!\u201d She wanted to hug her, kiss her, but her grandmother held up her hand as straight and cutting as a sword.\n\u201cBut you need to slow down, mijita. Remember, el que empieza corriendo termina caminando. What is the rush?\u201d\nDemi hated that old saying. It seemed to her a very stereotypically turtle thing to say, but her grandmother was right. She had no idea what she was doing. \u201cMaybe I should YouTube some Haitian machete fencing videos before I wield this thing in battle?\u201d She flicked her wrist, slicing the air like a clumsy ninja.\n\u201cPor favor!\u201d She chuckled and some of the sorrow washed away. Yeya sat on the edge of the bed and pulled Demi down next to her. \u201cAyapito only used that thing to cut ca\u00f1a. Ese flaco has never won a single fight with his fists in his entire life! But he was clever and charming and that counts for a lot.\u201d She sighed heavily and the bed undulated like an ocean.\nThe mention of Ayapito losing a fight sent a sudden chill down Demi\u2019s spine. \u201cI still don\u2019t understand how he could die in his sleep and have been attacked by this boya? If I \u2026 If I get killed out there, will my body be whisked back into bed, perfectly unperturbed?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Yeya, patted her granddaughter\u2019s thigh with a soft, leathery palm. \u201cYour grandfather had more tricks than he could remember. He was probably dreaming of being a turtle, and so he was both snoring in bed and paddling around in the lake.\u201d\nDemi tended to slouch, but she sat straighter at the very real thought of her own demise.\n\u201cCoge.\u201d Yeya pulled out a putrid smelling pouch from her pocket and hung it around Demi\u2019s neck. \u201cI also know a lot of tricks.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the heck is this?\u201d She gagged. How had she not smelled it until now?\n\u201cUn cocimiento antiguo. Yerba de jicotea to help you transform, because you\u2019ve lived almost your entire life as a girl and don\u2019t know anything at all, Vivapor\u00fa for its general potency \u2014 and a little something else for protection against evil spirits.\u201d\nDemi put her hand over her grandmother\u2019s hand. \u201cYou\u2019re okay with me doing this?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m worried.\u201d Yeya shrugged, not callously. Her eyes and smile gave her manner a tender resolve. \u201cBut we\u2019re turtles. We leave our young to fend for themselves on hostile shores. It\u2019s our way.\u201d\nDemi kissed Yeya on the cheek and without another word, she stood up and left the room.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe moon was nearly full in the watercolor sky. She didn\u2019t know if that was an auspicious sign, or a dreadful portent. Sweat soaked her T-shirt. She should\u2019ve listened more carefully to her grandparents\u2019 stories.\nDemi Dominguez tried to dredge up the courage to keep walking. She was a supernatural princess. A nexus point of two mythic turtle lineages. Her slow and steady forebears had survived the rise of dinosaurs, mass extinction events, conquests, colonization, slavery, dictatorships, economic collapses and immigration. She could handle one malignant spirit sitting at the bottom of her lake. She clutched the pungent pouch of herbs with her left hand and the weighty machete in her right, its curve reflected the silver moonlight. She put one foot in front of the other until her toes touched the water\u2019s razor edge.\nNo turning back now. She waded into the tepid lake. Black, wiggling tadpoles scattered like fireworks. Demi moved deliberately, trying to minimize the ripples that would alert her foe. Her mouth went arid with doubt. Her feet crunched on rocks and then sunk into squishy muck. The heaps of turtles behind her hissed a primeval dirge in her honor. She kept moving forward until the water tickled her waist. Then she inhaled deeply and slid below the surface, without ceremony or second thought.\nDemi entered a world the shade of green tea. A forest of spiraling, aquatic plants caressed her body. The memory of a frightened hatchling in the tangle flooded her mind. This had been her nursery. Bluegill and peacock bass darted away as she approached. She kicked, propelling herself deeper into the lake. Even in human form Demi could hold her breath for hours. Her eyes quickly adjusted to the gloom and the rich, familiar ecosystem came into view. She scanned the area carefully and found no demon lurking in the shadows, but she could taste faint hints of something bizarre lingering in the current. It fouled the water like an iridescent oil spill. She swam on, strong and agile.\nA long, black catfish zoomed by and almost made her gasp, which would\u2019ve been unfortunate while submerged. Demi thought about activating her grandmother\u2019s potion, but a part of her worried about shedding her human form. She\u2019d never done so before. What if she couldn\u2019t change back? What would happen to her extra molecules when she became a smaller creature? Would she get them all back? In exactly the same order? Worse still, what if she recognized her testundinal manifestation as her true form and the girl she\u2019d been for the last seventeen years just faded like a dream? No, she\u2019d grown to like the smart, squat, clumsy, little person she\u2019d become. Besides, she needed an opposable thumb to brandish Ayapito\u2019s machete. She let the pouch bob around her neck.\nDemi dived until the water chilled and darkened. Life grew scarce. Her skin prickled with goosebumps. Lake Vivien was not actually a lake but an artificial retention pond excavated by the city to mitigate flooding in the surrounding residential area. But she had traveled deeper than should be possible, beyond any city plans. Of course, like all bodies of water, the lake was also a portal to an immaterial abyss, a fathomless underworld twinkling with spectral flotsam. Demi stopped, suspended in space, her T-shirt drifted above her belly. She felt completely exposed. Where was she going? She noticed two pinpricks of light holding steady in the shimmering gyre. They burrowed into her like golden lasers. Her pulse quickened.\nThen something large swept through the dark water around her. She spun like a bath toy in its wake. Every muscle in her body locked with fear. She squeezed her eyes shut. The flavor of the water changed dramatically, acquiring the particular tang of sulfur emitted by decomposing sludge caged within mangrove roots.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be crazy coming down here, little girl!\u201d Demi felt the words rattle in the pit of her stomach like starvation. \u201cDidn\u2019t even have the decency to wear your true face!\u201d\nShe wrenched her eyes open. Tiny bubbles and particulates swirled in vortices around her head. Then she saw it. The massive boya, floating a short distance away. Jet-black and jet-fast. It was made of nightmare now, twenty feet long and two thousand pounds, all pulverizing jaws and anfractuous tail. Its four stubby legs dangled at its sides like an afterthought.\n\u201cYou killed my grandfather,\u201d she snarled, biting back the ballooning anxiety in her chest.\n\u201cYou mean, that ol\u2019 ghost turtle? Yeah.\u201d Its long rows of bone-white teeth ended in a smirk. \u201cCrunchy little morsel. Thought he could kick me out of this watering hole.\u201d\nThe machete\u2019s wooden handle smoldered in her fist. \u201cWell, I\u2019m here to kick you out.\u201d\n\u201cAre you?\u201d A terrible rumble, like a well-tuned Harley Davidson, resounded through the water. Demi braced herself. The beast shot toward her, streaking this way and that, pulling her along then wiping her around with a swish of its broad tail. This time she was ready. She recovered her equilibrium, attuned her internal buoyancy and thrust out with her machete. Strident metal met armored hide. Exhilaration cut through the viscous fear.\nThe rumble died. The roiling water settled, but the boya drifted \u2014 completely unharmed \u2014 three kicks away. Smug, serrated smile firmly in place. \u201cNice try, sweetheart.\u201d\n\u201cThis is my home.\u201d Her astral voice cracked, spilling all conviction like smoky blood in water.\n\u201cYou\u2019re what, a Cuban slider?\u201d\n\u201cCuban-American.\u201d\n\u201cWell then, that makes you an invasive species, don\u2019t it? I\u2019m an American Alligator. This is my territory, has been for all time. I might just do Florida Fish and Wildlife a favor and kill you right now.\u201d\nShe swung her blade into striking position, frog-kicking to stay in place. Drag made her movements slow and graceful. \u201cYou can try.\u201d\nHe came at her. Straight as a torpedo. She manage to glide sideways and \u2014 with all her strength \u2014 struck at its bow-shaped snout. The impact dislodged the machete from her grip. The boya\u2019s elongated silhouette thundered past her like a nuclear submarine, sending her tumbling head over heels on its slipstream \u2014 helpless \u2014 as her heirloom dagger sank to the bottom of the lake.\nHer head and stomach spun in different directions. She could taste vomit in the back of her throat. She grit her teeth and steadied herself.\nIt came at her again. No games or taunts, just fury. They churned around each other. Demi barely eluded its snapping jaws. Her compact size allowed her some maneuverability, but she was just stalling \u2014 unable to attack.\nThen she saw an opening, and planted both of her bare feet on the tender scales of its belly and pushed off and away from the turbulent clash. She plunged deeper into the lake, scissoring with all her might, stroking her arms wildly. She dived until her ears threatened to pop in her skull, and then deeper still. She needed that machete. She possessed no natural weapons, in any form. The crocodilian phantom scalded the water behind her.\nHer pupils eclipsed her honey-hued irises, panicked, hungry for light. She spotted a curved shadow below. She swam faster than any human could toward the promise of something. A round hollowed shape, pale yellow and russet, like a carved gourd, lay at the bottom of the lake. She had reached the bottom! For a heart-stopping instant Demi thought it was Ayapito\u2019s carcass lying in a bed of fish bones and pond scum.\n\u201cEnd of the line, child.\u201d\nA crippling pain shot through her right calf, but it was only an agonizing cramp and not the fatal stab of ten thousand pointed teeth. Not yet, anyway. She knifed through the water. Her eyes focused on the thing that wasn\u2019t her grandfather. It turned out to be the rusted-out chassis of an abandoned Volkswagen Beetle, waterlogged for five decades. There was no sign of the machete anywhere. It had been swallowed by the slime-covered graveyard.\nDemi\u2019s lungs tingled in complaint. \u00a1Co\u00f1o! She could hold her breath for hours if she were enjoying a leisurely dip. Now, fighting for her life, she burned through precious oxygen like a furnace. Her heart pounded into her sternum like on old ritual drum. Boiling blackness and the taste of rot surrounded her. The merciless hunter had finally caught up with its arrogant prey. Every cell in her body screamed for the congenial protection of a shell. She gave into the prehistoric compulsion and scrambled for sunken car.\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m done with you, I\u2019m going up there and have myself a turtle buffet. You hear me?\u201d\nThe door jammed, but she pried it open enough to squeeze her soft human form inside. Then she shrank into the car\u2019s backseat as the monster outside probed and pounded the wrecked VW.\nWith the temporary safety, Demi\u2019s mind quieted somewhat. She understood the utter lunacy of coming down here. The audacity! This creature was just as hoary as any jicotea, had survived the same travails, and was unimaginably more powerful. The words \u201csuicide\u201d and \u201ccome mierda\u201d trickled into her mind along with the torrential terror.\nThe boya snapped up the car in its colossal jaws. Glass exploded and corroded metal screeched as five hundred pounds of pressure crushed the weakened vehicle. Demi fought the urge to scream. Then, the beast surrendered to its primal nature and spun its great body, car firmly in mouth, in a frenzied death roll. Demi smashed her head. A sharp piece of glass sliced her back. A tire went gliding into the murk. After an eternity, the boya flung the Beetle to the side like a crumpled soda can.\nDemi accepted that this was the end. She lay beaten, wedged between the backseat and perforated roof at the bottom of a lake she had so foolishly thought of as her own. It had been a short, mundane life for the Jicotea Princess. Her Mami and Papi wouldn\u2019t even find her body to bury. She was delirious. How had Ayapito and Yeya managed to live such incredibly long lives when the spirit world was so damned savage?\nHer grandmother\u2019s words pierced the vertiginous ringing in her ears. Ayapito had never actually won a single fight with his fists. He was clever and used tricks.\nThe boya circled outside, ranting, \u201cI belong here. I\u2019m tied to this land. I draw succor from it.\u201d Boom! Snout hammered car.\nIt was right. Yeya\u2019s protection spell hadn\u2019t worked because the alligator spirit wasn\u2019t evil at all \u2014 just angry and stupid \u2014 and this was its ancestral home. It had every right to be here. Boom! But it had a terrible appetite and Demi could not allow it to devour her family and friends \u2014 her tribe.\nHer grandmother\u2019s charm drifted across her face, its repugnant pong roused her like smelling salts. Demi reached out and grabbed it. It hurt so much to move, but the potent herbs felt warm in her frigid hand. If she transformed, would she keep her injuries or would her new body be unharmed? Would her ravenous lungs be refilled with air? A magical second-wind? The boya clamped down on the wreck. Metal squealed. Through a shattered window she saw down its ashen gullet. Demi knew she couldn\u2019t survive another violent roll.\nShe ripped the cord from her neck and sent the pouch sailing into the waiting maw. A final act of defiance and desperation.\nA conflagration of opalescent light engulfed the dreary universe, like pearls on fire. Her dark-adapted eyes went blind, but she saw the boya consumed by her grandmother\u2019s juju as a neon afterimage on the inside of her eyelids. It writhed in pain. Its growl shook the beat-up car. Then all was quiet.\nWhen Demi\u2019s vision returned, her adversary floated before her, utterly stupefied. Clumps of pond scum fell like a slow-moving blizzard. She blinked, unsure of what she was looking at. The boya\u2019s gargantuan form had been dwarfed by the sudden radiance. It was pug-nosed now. Its barded torso compressed. Its once prodigious tail swished, thin and unimpressive.\n\u201cWhat the fuck did you do to me?\u201d A wild panic tinted its golden eyes.\nDemi wanted to laugh \u2014 and cry. If her entire body didn\u2019t ache, if she weren\u2019t worried about a concussion or the shard of glass embedded in her back, she would\u2019ve cackled like a witch. As it was, she had trouble controlling the wide grin spreading on her face. Ayapito would have loved this. \u201cI turned you into a turtle. An alligator snapping turtle to be precise.\u201d\n\u201cChange me back!\u201d She could see the strain on its newly-flattened face, it was trying to undo the enchantment, to shift back the same way it did between reptile and human, but Demi had changed something fundamental \u2014 altered its core being. The demon gator had depended on brute force alone throughout the eons, and knew no other tricks. It was stuck.\n\u201cUm, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d she said, ruefully.\nIts hooked bill went agape with disbelief, its front legs waggled with unrestrained outrage, but compared to mere moments before, the boya looked absolutely comical. It was also bound by time-honored magic and etiquette to obey its new princess.\nDemi pulled herself out of the twisted-steel husk. She grimaced as pain crawled up and down her body. Then swam toward it, acutely aware of each pang and throb. \u201cI couldn\u2019t beat you and I couldn\u2019t, in good conscience, exile you from your home \u2014 so I made you one of us.\u201d She stroked its bumpy, boney shell and it tried to nip her fingers off. \u201cWelcome to the Jicotea tribe! You can stay in our lake as long as you like. Just don\u2019t attack any of the neighbors.\u201d\n\u201cI killed your grandfather! Ground him up into dust!\u201d\nDemi nodded and shrugged, not unlike her grandmother. There was no malice in her manner, just exhaustion. \u201cA turtle for a turtle, right?\u201d She started to ascend. Her movements were very slow and deliberate. The boya watched her for a while then paddled away into the dark. It would curse her, shout and yell, tear at its new shell \u2014 perhaps contemplate this unexpected chapter in its life. Demi too had a lot to think about. She lowered her metabolism to conserve what little oxygen she had. There was no hurry now. She flexed her legs with the languid rhythm of swaying aquatic plants. It was night and so the different zones within the lake would all be equally inky. The only light in the water was the glimmer of if\u00e1 smoldering in her eye.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue28\/3lbe28_story5.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"When Demi Dominguez roared in on her skateboard, the stink of diesel and pulsing ambulance lights slammed her to a stop.

Marching down the driveway of the house across the street was a short, fat man beating a chubby fist on the shiniest trash can Bob had ever seen. The drummer, resplendent in a balloon sleeved orange fiesta shirt and sky blue pants, was drumming and grinning, swinging along as if he were leading a circus parade. Trailing behind him was a stout little woman dressed entirely in black and a painfully thin little girl in a tee shirt and jeans. Bob watched as the fat man halted at the curb, set the can down, and waited for his followers to catch up. When they joined him by the side of the road, he straightened the trash can, ran a hand through his oily black hair, and gazed benevolently up and down the street at all the other garbage cans waiting for collection the next day.\n\u201cAnn!\u201d Bob called to his wife. \u201cC'mere quick! You\u2019re not gonna believe what\u2019s going on outside.\u201d Ann rushed into the living room, a long spoon still in her hand from stirring supper.\n\u201cWhat? What is it?\u201d she asked, pushing in next to him at the window. Bob didn\u2019t bother answering, only pointed toward the people at the curb. Shooting her husband a disappointed look, Ann said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s only the new neighbors, the Kartoupelos. I thought something was wrong.\u201d\n\u201cKartoupelos?\u201d Bob said.\n\u201cYes, they moved in on Thursday. They\u2019re renting the old Peterson house. You know, the one that never sold because it\u2019s falling apart. Betty down the block said she thinks they\u2019re from one of those places that used to be part of the Soviet Union.\u201d\n\u201cKartoupelo? What the hell kind of name is that?\u201d\n\u201cI told you, Ukrainian or Siberian or something.\u201d\n\u201cBut what\u2019re they doing?\u201d Bob wanted to know.\n\u201cWhy, they\u2019re taking out the trash, silly. Look, I\u2019ve gotta get back in the kitchen before dinner is ruined.\u201d Ann hurried out of the room while Bob stared out the window. He watched as the Kartoupelos stood smiling at all the garbage cans, plastic pails, and trash bags set out on the street, their own container the handsomest by far.\nProblems at the office, planning a summer vacation their ten year-old daughter could endure, and all of life\u2019s other day to day details claimed Bob\u2019s attention, and he didn\u2019t spare another thought for the new neighbors until he came home from work the following Wednesday and found the ladder leaning against the side of the house. He went straight into the spare room Ann had turned into her office and, hoping there was some other explanation, asked if she'd been up on the roof.\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said, as if Bob didn\u2019t know perfectly well that such a thing was possible. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d\n\u201cThe ladder\u2019s out like somebody was up there.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I forgot. Papa was cleaning out the gutters.\u201d\n\u201cYour father was here?\u201d Bob was totally confused. He couldn\u2019t picture Ed Meeker taking time out from his medical practice to scoop sludge out of their drainpipes.\n\u201cNo, dad wasn\u2019t here.\u201d Ann spoke absently, peering at her computer screen. \u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d\n\u201cWell, you said\u2026\u201d\nAnn turned to face her husband. \u201cOh, you thought I meant\u2026 no, Mr. Kartoupelo was cleaning them. Everyone calls him Papa, that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t understand.\u201d She swung back to the monitor.\n\u201cHow come he was doing that?\u201d\nAnn made a few quick motions with the mouse and said, \u201cWell, you\u2019ve been promising to go up there since the end of autumn, and here it is practically July and you never made it. You should\u2019ve seen all the gunk he pulled out of there.\u201d\nDespite the fact that Bob was glad to have avoided the job, he still felt that his rightful place as doer of dangerous deeds for the household had been usurped. He heard the whine in his voice as he complained, \u201cI would\u2019ve gotten around to it. How did he end up doing it?\u201d\n\u201cHe came over and asked,\u201d Ann said matter-of-factly. \u201cFrom what I could understand, his English isn\u2019t exactly perfect, he does odd jobs around town. I guess he\u2019s having a hard time getting a regular job. But he\u2019s a good worker, he even took all the bags of slimy leaves with him.\u201d\n\u201cLucky he didn\u2019t break the ladder and sue us,\u201d Bob sulked. \u201cFat guy like that oughtta stay on the ground where he belongs.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I think it was a bargain at twenty dollars,\u201d Ann said, opening a new computer file and closing the Kartoupelo subject with one crisp motion.\nThat day seemed to Bob the beginning of a perpetual involvement of his family with the Kartoupelos. The first thing he heard when he got out of his car the next evening was a heavily accented voice from across the street hollering, \u201cPapa\u2019s home!\u201d Bob looked over just in time to see the neighbor\u2019s front door burst open, Mrs. K and little whatshername dashing out to greet the fat foreigner bounding up the walkway. Bob watched as the three of them embraced as if Papa was returning from some long, bloody war that he'd won single-handedly. Shaking his head, Bob headed up his own front steps where not even the cat came to meet him.\nDuring dinner that night Ann casually mentioned that their daughter, Cindy, had spent the day playing with the Kartoupelo\u2019s little girl. Bob turned to his daughter, trying to catch her eye as she rolled some peas around her plate. \u201cIs that so?\u201d He asked. She made a minute head movement that he took to be a nod. \u201cHave a good time?\u201d\n\u201cMnh hmn.\u201d\n\u201cShe about your age?\u201d\n\u201cMnh.\u201d\n\u201cSo, what'd you do over there?\u201d\n\u201cOh, they had a lot of fun,\u201d Ann jumped in. \u201cDidn\u2019t you, dear?\u201d\n\u201cI guess.\u201d Cindy mumbled. \u201cThey got all old stuff.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of old stuff?\u201d Bob said, leaning over to see his daughter\u2019s face.\n\u201cY'know, like junk.\u201d Cindy finally looked up from her pea pushing. \u201cTheir furniture\u2019s all scratched up like they got it at the dump, and there\u2019s a brick holding up one side of the couch. Even their clothes look like they used to belong to somebody else. And their house smells gross! Do I have to go over there again, Daddy? Krista talks funny and she doesn\u2019t even have a CD player.\u201d\n\u201cIt was my idea,\u201d Ann said. \u201cKrista, that\u2019s the little girl, was outside all by herself. She was scratching at the sidewalk with a piece of broken chalk, and she looked so lonely. I just thought it might be nice if she and Cindy could be friends.\u201d\nBob glanced at his wife, wondering how to approach the situation. Her expression was just the one he expected, the one that told him that if he reached down deep enough he'd come up with the right answer. It was as if a bit of Ann\u2019s innate kindness flowed across the table, the words suddenly in his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go there if you don\u2019t want to, but I think it'd be nice. Imagine if you were in an unfamiliar country with no friends. Wouldn\u2019t you want someone to be kind to you?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d Cindy said.\n\u201cSure you would. They probably couldn\u2019t take all their things with them when they came here. Maybe it was real bad where they used to live and they had to get out in a hurry. I\u2019ll bet that in a few months they\u2019ll fit right in. Just watch, they\u2019ll end up more like us than you could ever imagine.\u201d\nAnn beamed at her husband, Cindy seemed unsure but maybe willing to give them a chance, and Bob found himself believing his own words. Believing them until late the following Sunday when his orderly little world spun into a whole new orbit.\nAs Bob was taking out the trash that Sunday evening, he witnessed the same scene across the street as the week before. Papa Kartoupelo, dressed in a different, but just as colorful costume, came drumming and marching down his driveway, leading his tiny trash procession to the curb.Bob\u2019s curiosity wouldn\u2019t allow him to return quietly to his own house, but propelled him across the road to stand before the neighbors, a foolish grin plastered to his face, an awkward hand stuck out in greeting.\n\u201cHi, I'm Bob Mahoney. From across the way? I couldn\u2019t help noticing you out here, so I thought I'd introduce myself.\u201d He was grateful when the man took his hand so he could stop babbling for a minute. The grip was like a steel trap.\n\u201cI am Papa Kartoupelo,\u201d the man pronounced carefully. He made a sweeping gesture toward his wife and daughter. \u201cThis my family, Kira an Krista.\u201d\nBob nodded while the woman offered a shy smile and the girl studied the toes of her worn sneakers. \u201cWell,\u201d Bob began awkwardly, \u201cI see you\u2019re having quite a time taking out the trash.\u201d\nPapa lit up like a little boy with a new toy. \u201cTomorrow garbage day, so tonight we celebrate Garbage Eve. This country so wonderful, a holiday every week!\u201d\n\u201cGuess I never looked at it like that,\u201d Bob said, trying to think of a graceful way to escape this fat madman.\n\u201cWhere we come from,\u201d Papa explained, \u201cwhole village could live for month on what people throw away on this street tonight.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose we are pretty wasteful,\u201d Bob said.\n\u201cThat what make this land so great,\u201d Papa said gathering his wife and child in his bear-like arms. They turned and started up the driveway, leaving Bob speechless at the curb.\nBob dreamt of garbage that night: huge mounds of trash, like a rubbish mountain range extending as far as the eye could see. The Kartoupelo family frolicked, hand in hand, across the slopes. Krista took a running dive off a tall, trash cliff, crashing into a wickedly gleaming pile of sharp silver cans. Bob sat straight up in bed.\nRubbing his eyes, trying to wipe away the image of Krista\u2019s slashed face, Bob lay back on his pillow. He rolled onto his side and heard the same metallic sound from his dream. For one appallingly long moment he was sure he'd see the little girl\u2019s torn face grinning up at him if he peeked over the side of the bed. Then the noise came again and he realized he was hearing it through the open window.\nSneaking out of bed so as not to wake Ann, he crept to the window and looked down onto the midnight street. He could just make out the lighter shade of the sidewalk and some darker shapes that he took to be his trash pails. He was thinking that there seemed to be too many pails, when one of the shapes moved. And then another and another. Three shadowy figures seemed to be digging in the garbage cans.\nBob hustled down the stairs, hoping to catch them in the act. His hand was closing around the knob on the front door when he froze. Something told him he didn\u2019t want to go out there, didn\u2019t want the prowlers to know he saw them. It was a little like catching somebody picking their nose at a red light, or seeing someone kick a dog when they think no one is looking. Or witnessing a member of your community engaged in some behavior so unnatural that they might just do something to keep you from telling anyone. And it was that last thought that stopped Bob in his tracks. There was no way he was going to confront them at their witching hour work, but he had to find out exactly what it was they were doing.\nMoving to a front window, he lifted the shade just enough to peek out. He could hear the rattle of the cans clearly and, as his eyes adjusted to the gloom, he began to recognize Papa Kartoupelo\u2019s round form selecting tidbits of trash and stashing them in [some sort of sack]. Evidently his wife and child couldn\u2019t wait to get home for the feast; they were rooting around in the pails, coffee grounds slopping from Mrs. K\u2019s over-full maw, bits of eggshell stuck to little Krista\u2019s chin, as they chomped and slurped and gobbled the garbage. Bob felt he'd be sick if he watched for a minute longer, but he couldn\u2019t tear his eyes from the abominable banquet for even a second. Papa finally filled his bag, popped something into his mouth that might\u2019ve been the bit of moldy cheese that Ann had thrown away the day before, and headed up the sidewalk, presumably, towards the next offering.\nAfter a moment, Kira and the youngest Kartoupelo followed.\nThat seemed to break the spell. Bob backed away from the window, unconsciously running his tongue through his lips, swallowing over and over to ease the dryness in his mouth. He collapsed onto the couch and sat in the dark, wondering if he could tell even his wife what he'd seen.\nThe next morning, Bob woke up stiff and sore from the sofa. He'd finally fallen asleep sometime near dawn, after turning on the television to purge the pictures from his head. By the time his wife and daughter woke up and Bob had a couple of cups of coffee, the events of the night before didn\u2019t seem quite as bizarre. Not that he thought it was normal to scrounge for food in someone\u2019s garbage, but he began to consider the idea that what the Kartoupelos had been doing might not be considered outlandish behavior back where they'd come from. For years he'd heard stories from his parents about the Depression, how it'd turned people into misers and workaholics. Maybe this was the same kind of thing. The Kartoupelos were probably victims of such poverty that they'd learned to scavenge to survive. Bob thought back to what he had told his daughter about giving the new neighbors time to adjust, and decided to take his own advice.\nOver the next few days Bob found himself increasingly irritable at work. At home he grew distant, retreating behind the newspaper or through the T.V. screen. As much as he wanted to believe that the best course was to mind his own business, a part of him, that bothersome part that had conjured the vision of the girl\u2019s bloody face, insisted he do something. He was angry because he wasn\u2019t sure how to handle the situation, and furious that he felt it was his responsibility to figure it out.\nIt all came to a head when he drove up his street on Thursday night. There was Papa, bouncing down the sidewalk, calling out his customary \u201cPapa\u2019s home!\u201d as he reached his yard. The sight of his neighbor, the oblivious bluster of the man, made up Bob\u2019s mind that it was time to go over there and see if there was anything he could do to straighten the whole thing out. Perhaps have a talk with them about food banks and charitable organizations. At least drop a few hints about the dangers of disease.\nMrs. Kartoupelo, attired in her usual drab uniform, opened the door and immediately turned her head, calling over her shoulder in an odd sounding language that Bob wasn\u2019t able to identify. Papa came bustling to the entryway, nudging his wife aside and greeting Bob in his loud bass voice. He wore a conservative pair of red bib overalls and seemed extremely pleased to have company. Taking Bob by the hand, he led him to a seat in the living room. Mrs. K left the men alone.\nThe first thing Bob noticed after sitting down was the odor. It made sense that the place would smell bad, considering their dining habits, but there was a foulness to the air that went beyond the mere pungency of spoiled food. He tried to ignore it, looking around the room with a silly smile on his face. The furniture was just as his daughter had described it, looking like it had been unearthed instead of bought. There was not a single decoration of any kind on the walls, and Bob was surprised to see that there wasn\u2019t the television set that he assumed would be in even the poorest of American dwellings. There wasn\u2019t even a radio in sight. He wondered how they amused themselves when they weren\u2019t out gathering garbage. Mr. Kartoupelo hovered over Bob, an expectant expression on his fleshy face. Bob searched for a casual tone.\n\u201cListen, I was thinking, Mr. \u2026\u201d\n\u201cPapa! Call me Papa. We friends.\u201d\n\u201cYea, well uh, Papa. Like I said, I was thinking. Being neighbors an all\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYes, neighbors!\u201d Papa agreed happily.\n\u201cI think neighbors should help one another, and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOf course, help. What you need?\u201d Papa bent down, apparently so Bob could whisper, should he be embarrassed to beg out loud.\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d Bob said quickly, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I thought I might be able to do something for you. Maybe lend you a couple of bucks. I realize you\u2019ve got your pride, and I don\u2019t mean to insult you, but just to make sure your wife and daughter have enough to eat, until you can get on your feet.\u201d\nBob saw he was getting nowhere. He hated to do it, but the guy just wasn\u2019t getting it. \u201cLook, I saw you Sunday night. In the\u2026 you know, in my garbage. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, I wasn\u2019t spying or anything, I just happened to glance out the window. What you\u2019re doing is unhealthy! And its also unnecessary. If you don\u2019t want to take anything from me, there\u2019s all sorts of assistance out there. But you\u2019ve gotta stop doing what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re all going to get sick! Understand?\u201d\nPapa walked toward the doorway. \u201cI understand. We not sick, healthy as pack of wolves. Now you must go home. You are tired, talk crazy.\u201d He stood holding the door, and Bob had no choice but to leave. He also knew that he had no choice but to tell someone what was going on. And he wasn\u2019t about to waste his time with cumbersome state agencies or ineffectual charitable foundations. It was time to do what he should\u2019ve done in the first place, bring out the big guns. Bob went home and told his wife everything.\nAs always, her confidence amazed him. After he'd finished telling the tale, the words tumbling out like a guilt-crazed schoolboy\u2019s in a confessional, Ann headed out to have a \u201cmother-to-mother talk\u201d with Kira Kartoupelo. Bob had a feeling that after ten minutes alone with his wife, Mrs. K would be ready to write down recipes and begin clipping coupons. He was sitting at the kitchen table, just starting to enjoy the feeling that everything would be all right, when Ann came through the back door.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not home,\u201d she said.\n\u201cSure they are,\u201d Bob said. I told you I was just over there.\u201d\n\u201cWell, if they are, they\u2019re not answering the door.\u201d\nBob stood up, saying, \u201cI'm gonna find out what they\u2019re up to, now.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t do anything foolish,\u201d Ann called to him. But he was already out the door.\nBob marched up the Kartoupelo\u2019s front steps and jammed a finger into the doorbell button. He heard the chime, but that was all that happened; no footsteps, no plump woman in black, no hearty welcome from his new buddy, Papa. After punching the button a few more times, Bob decided they weren\u2019t going to play games with him. He walked around the house, peeping in windows, listening for some tell-tale sound to prove the house wasn\u2019t empty. From what he could see, only the living room and kitchen were furnished, the other rooms used to store junk that ranged from broken exercise bikes to old fashioned dress dummies.\nThe last window he checked looked in on a space the size of a small bedroom that was almost completely filled with plastic garbage bags. He picked up the odor right through the glass, and was about to give up his search when he noticed the pile of clothes in a corner. At least that was what he assumed it was, but there was something wrong about it. The more he stared, the less it looked like clothes heaped in that dusty corner. He gave the window frame a tentative push, and the glass slid smoothly up. The stench was overpowering. Turning his head, Bob took a deep breath, then angled himself into the room.\nWith every step he told himself that this was insane, he'd be caught, probably arrested, but he kept on wading through the bags toward the corner. It seemed to take forever, placing his feet carefully among the soft sacks. When he reached the pile, his breath burst from his lungs, but he no longer noticed the smell. Every bit of his attention was focused on what lay in the corner. For a second his brain refused to accept what he was seeing, insisting that it was nothing more than a stack of foam pads, some leftover carpet matting. A glimpse of finger, a flash of foot, and his mind invented a collection of rubber costumes, stored out of the way until the next Halloween. A good hard look at a tangle of oily black hair, deflated breast, flattened little girl face, and Bob\u2019s head gave up trying to fool him. He stared at the three empty skins, wondering who they'd belonged to before the Kartoupelos.\nBob managed to pry himself away from that vile pile, not so much because he was afraid of getting caught in the house, although the very thought terrified him, but because he found the sight of those pelts utterly fascinating. And that scared the hell out of him because he understood that if he didn\u2019t get out of there quick, he might just have to touch them. He experienced a reckless curiosity, a desperate longing to know how this was done, to understand exactly what these creatures, these Kartoupelos, were about. Forcing himself back across the room, he ducked through the window and ran toward his house.\nAnn was waiting for him when he returned. \u201cWell?\u201d she asked, \u201cwere they there?\u201d\n\u201cNo, they\u2019ve gone away.\u201d\n\u201cGone away? What do you mean, moved out? I didn\u2019t see a truck or anything. Are you sure they\u2019re gone, gone, or just out for a while? How can you tell? You didn\u2019t go in there, did you?\u201d\n\u201cI just know.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe they went to the store or out visiting someone.\u201d\n\u201cVisiting?\u201d Bob began to laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2026 they can\u2019t go visiting without their\u2026\u201d His laughter turned shrill, almost a shriek. \u201cI don\u2019t know where they are, but its not out for a goddamn visit!\u201d He collapsed into a chair, eyes wild, howling in helpless, air gulping laughter.\nAll that evening, Bob sat and stared at the T.V., jumping at every noise, a slight twitch developing in his right eye. Ann kept a close watch on him, figuring he would eventually tell her what was bothering him when he'd worried whatever it was to a stalemate. When the eleven o'clock news came on and Bob was still silent, Ann went up to bed, leaving her husband to fall into a fitful sleep on the couch.\nBob sat straight up on the sofa. Rubbing his eyes, trying to wipe away the nightmare image, he lay back on the couch. He rolled onto his side and heard the same metallic sound from his dream. Then the noise came again and he realized he was hearing it from outside. He rushed to the front window, gazing out at the empty street, then caught his mistake: this wasn\u2019t Garbage Eve, the cans were still in back of the house where he kept them during the week. He made his way to the kitchen window.\nIn the darkness of the back yard, Bob was able to make out two figures, one larger than the other. As he watched, they foraged through the trash, the larger one leaning deep into a pail, the smaller sifting through the debris that spilled from the other can laying on its side. Bob was wondering where Papa was when his eyes adjusted just enough to recognize the scavengers. His head reeled, his stomach lurched, as he gaped at his wife and daughter gobbling up the garbage. He passed out cold on the kitchen floor when a voice behind him whispered, \u201cPapa\u2019s home.\u201d\n\u2022\n\u00a9 1999 Lester Thees, all rights reserved","source":null,"source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/9tqbN6QKo0sCpLOvF+4R-yG4Mho.json"}

That didn\u2019t stop the panic from rising in his voice.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think I\u2019ve tried,\u201d Meredith replied, that red slash of a mouth curling into a contemptuous sneer. \u201cThey forgot an off switch.\u201d\nThere was a loud thumping and bits of plaster tumbled down the walls, their noise as quiet as mice. A voice in Terrance\u2019s head whispered a reminder that the clients were getting through. The bloodlust now clouded their minds, the need to hit and bite and scratch overwhelming.\n\u201cThere\u2019s got to be a way to calm them down,\u201d Terrance stated.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Meredith replied, \u201cNo, there isn't.\u201d Her voice hiding a hint of laughter.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe information inside the file was gathered by an attractive dark-haired woman named Lindsey. Lindsey had been the Intake Counselor when Terrance started at the CDT years ago, and she hadn\u2019t seemed to age at all, he noticed on a number of occasions, or ever look her age of forty. Presently, she was slumped against the kitchen sink with a pipe rammed through her gut.\nAccording to her Direct Care Worker at St. John's, Meredith Coney had been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic, with possible schizoaffective disorder. Policemen had brought the girl to the hospital after finding her on the side of the Van Wyck Expressway, screaming. Coney was very well spoken and non-violent. She suffered from delusions involving 'Mems.' The Mems, according to her statement, were mysterious men and women who conducted medical experiments to create new weapons \u2014 for whom, she didn\u2019t know.\nIt was no secret that the CDT was in desperate need of some new, low-risk clients. The suicide the month before had brought auditors like locust and a change in upper management. It was the sort of chaos that meant rocky times for the 'trench divisions\u2019 like Terrance's. Meredith, who was quiet and non-violent in spite of her delusions, seemed perfect.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cThis is stupid\u2026what you\u2019re doing,\u201d she told him.\n\u201cI'm trying to save your life.\u201d Terrance snapped. The red rage flashing behind his eyes now matched the thumping of his heart. He took the pill bottle from his pocket and rubbed his thumb against the lid absently.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t design me for re-use. I'm a one-shot weapon. To be deployed and cleaned up after.\u201d\nTerrance looked at her, tried to connect her with the screaming just outside his office\u2019s thin walls, the smells wafting through the circulation ducts. He told himself that she was something evil, something designed to kill whole towns.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he eventually decided aloud.\n\u201cWho said it had to?\u201d she responded.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cHere we have a young white woman, twenty-five years of age, diagnosed with mild schizophrenia undifferentiated, a consistent delusional mindset, evidence of some paranoia. Supposedly not a danger to herself or other, tested clean for alcohol and drugs, no history of abuse\u2026did anyone see her?\u201d\nDr. Blevins nodded. He scratched his neck absently. \u201cShe was very lucid, a good historian up until three years ago, when her delusions begins.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the 'Mems\u2019 scenario?\u201d\nDr. Blevins\u2019 already sour face puckered up even more, as if he swallowed a lemon whole\u2026with a spoiled milk chaser. \u201cYes. She claims that three years ago she was kidnapped from her car by these beings she called 'Mems.' The Mems, according to the patient description, resemble the 'Men in Black' of conspiracy theorists. These Mem held her in an upstate hospital against her will and experimented upon her until she escaped six months ago \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cAt which point she is found on the Van Wyck,\u201d Terrance suggested.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nTerrance continued going through the folder with a careful eye. The packet was surprisingly clean of the usual highlighted portions indicating problems with potential intakes. \u201cAnd she\u2019s been meds compliant, no incidents, no indication of decompensation?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d offered Jimmy, the counselor who ran the day Center\u2019s MICA program for hardcore drug and alcohol abusers. \u201cMy only concern is that she doesn\u2019t seem to be getting better.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have made much progress either if I was at St. John's,\u201d Lindsey said with a slight bemused smile.\nJimmy nodded. \u201cThey\u2019ve been having more trouble than us with their charges. In this case, the CSW may not be blowing smoke out of their asses. She may need a more stable environment.\u201d\n\u201cYou know what I heard,\u201d piped up Wanda, the clinician. With her roundish, wrinkled head and propensity for cable-knit sweaters, she always reminded Terrance of a tortoise. \u201cI heard they caught one of the orderlies torturing a patient.\u201d\nTerrance looked up from the file sternly. \u201cWanda, that was in poor taste.\u201d\nJimmy shrugged. \u201cI think we\u2019ve all heard stories like that. Some wild, wild stuff was happening on those wards. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ever going to find out what.\u201d\n\u201cStill \u2014 let\u2019s be sensitive, people,\u201d Terrance warned. \u201cUnder different circumstances, it might be our program people were talking about like that. Do we want to give Ms. Coney a trial?\u201d\nDr. Blevins tilted his head to one side. \u201cShe has no real downside. Let her try the program for three months.\u201d\n\u201cAny objections?\u201d\nThere was some general muttering, but no objections.\nTerrance looked toward Lindsey. \u201cThen let\u2019s bring her in.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIt was hot inside his office. The three white strips over the ventilation duct hung limp. Meredith tucked her long legs under her and watched him loosen his tie.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t believe me at St. John\u2019s either,\u201d she offered.\nThere was a series of thumping noises, in rapid succession, each impact accompanied by a sour musical note. The Musical Expression Group must\u2019ve decided there was a better use for its brass instruments.\n\u201cBut you were listed as non-violent.\u201d\nHe could hear her shifting position. She placed a hand on his arm. Her flesh was cold enough for him to feel through his suit jacket and dress shirt. He imagined her studying his profile in the emergency lights, deciding how to break it to him.\n\u201cIt was how they planned it,\u201d she explained to him as if to a child. Her breath, in contrast to her skin, was warm \u2014 feverishly so. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t work if I was the one behaving oddly.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nTerrance looked up from the protocol memo on his desk. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\nJimmy sat down opposite Terrance, the smile on his face so wide as to be predatory. \u201cThe Mems is not just a private delusion of our Ms. Coney.\u201d\nTerrance paused. He put aside the memo. \u201cGet outta here.\u201d\nIf possible, Jimmy\u2019s smile grew wider. \u201cI was discussing our latest patient with a colleague over at Rockland \u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t do that, Jimmy,\u201d Terrance admonished.\nJimmy snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I didn\u2019t use names. Anyway, I made reference to 'the Mems,' and guess what? Rockland had a client with delusions highly similar to hers.\u201d\n\u201cHow similar?\u201d\nJimmy flipped open his reporter\u2019s pad. \u201cPatient claimed to have participated in a pharmacological study that was secretly funded by a black ticket organization called 'Dulles Mem.' This organization took the patient to an abandoned hospital somewhere in upstate New York and experimented on him, developing against his will certain psionic empathic abilities.\u201d\nTerrance paused. He adjusted himself in his chair. \u201cSo what are you saying \u2014 that these 'Mems\u2019 Ms. Coney tells us about are real?\u201d\nJimmy put away his pad. \u201cMaybe. Or these Mems are a developing urban legend or something we\u2019ve never come across.\u201d\nTerrance, in retrospect, had heard the beginning of the incident through the wall his office shared with Group Room Three. But at the time, the unintelligible mutterings meant nothing. \u201cDid Rockland try to locate this Dulles Mem?\u201d\n\u201cNo such luck\u2026although the guy tried pretty damn hard\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s bring this up at deposition nex \u2014\u201d\nThere was a crash next door, and the intercom came to life. \u201cCode One, Room Three!\u201d\nCode One was the callsign indicating a violent situation on the grounds. Terrance and Jimmy were already on their feet. Some of the clients were beginning to scream and cry. There was blood smeared on the glass to the Group Room. Security rushed up from the Kitchen area.\nTerrance went back into his office to call an ambulance. He was sure it was going to be an isolated incident.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMeredith\u2019s face was only an inch away from Terrance. With every word she formed, he felt her breath stirring his hair. Her body brushed up against him. Terrance felt a physical stirring and fought the impulse to leap away from her, to startle her, or himself. It was the paranoia mounting, he thought, just that momentary loss of control flared into its own burst of fear.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to stop until they find us,\u201d Meredith told him.\nShadows moved across the frosted glass \u2014 the sounds of furniture being overturned and equipment smashed. A high-pitched shriek rose from the bullpen until one of the shadows lifted something high up and brought it down hard. Crimson dotted his office glass.\n\u201cWhy would anyone do this,\u201d he asked aloud, not really to her. He moved himself away from the warmth of her body. In the partial light of his office, Terrance thought he saw her smiling.\n\u201cTo win,\u201d she said. \u201cDrop me in an enemy country\u2019s capitol, let the virus take hold, and the citizens will destroy themselves.\u201d\n\u201cBut y-you'd still be free.\u201d Terrance looked at the bottle in his hands; anything to look away from her.\nMeredith stirred, shook her head with a languid slowness. \u201cWell, if they\u2019re killing everything in the area, and I'm in the area, then I die as well, right?\u201d\nThere was a frighteningly loud thump as a chair slammed against the door, making it shudder and cracking the glass. Terrance looked around for something to defend himself. \u201cThat\u2019s insane.\u201d\nA low chuckle rose from Meredith\u2019s throat. \u201cWhy do you think I'm here, director?\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIt began as a general overall irritability in the client population. At first, they were uncooperative, some of them crying for no reason. Terrance felt himself tense when he walked through the halls.\nThen Jerry, a MICA client, became upset when asked if he had gone back to using crack. Jerry expressed the intensity of his upset by slamming a counselor\u2019s head into the dryer repeatedly.\nLater that week, another client expressed her frustration at not painting her ceramics project correctly by smashing the item over the client next to her.\nThen Jimmy found one of the non-violent clients inside one of the staff bathrooms, watching her own hands impassionately as she drowned had one of the intern\u2019s in the toilet.\nThere was no question there would be audits. Terrance knew there would probably be some disciplinary action. He didn\u2019t care; he wanted the rash of incidents to end. The rash of increasing Code Ones.\nWhich is when Meredith\u2019s full story came out.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to stop,\u201d he realized aloud.\n\u201cNo they\u2019re not,\u201d whispered Meredith. He could hear her shifting position again behind him. \u201cI did a little reading while I was on the street \u2014 after I got away from the Mems. You'd be surprised at what you can find in a comprehensive library.\u201d\nTerrance remained silent, debating about whether he should open up the bottle or not.\nHe could feel her moving closer. It surprised him that, even though the noise beyond his office was a howling cacophony of carnage, Terrance heard every word of her whisper.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s something about the particular brain chemistry of the mentally ill,\u201d she theorized, her words coming slowly and carefully. \u201cThey absorb the psionic signal I'm sending with a greater efficiency \u2014 making them kill-crazy sooner. And since they\u2019re already deeply psychotic, they tend to act out with a great deal more violence. If it wasn\u2019t for that, your staff might\u2019ve had more of a chance.\u201d She sounded like a weapon now, if he'd had any doubt.\nTerrance looked down at the pill bottle. The mild sedatives rattled inside the plastic container. He wondered if was the self-medication that kept him from joining the beasts outside, from becoming one of the half-human berserkers scratching at his door.\n\u201cWe need to get you out of here,\u201d he insisted.\n\u201cWhy? So I can infect the neighborhood?\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nConey is a 25-year-old white female who looks younger than her stated age. Patient was referred by Jamaica Hospital Medical Center. Patient proved to be a lucid historian, and displayed good ADLs. She presented well, being very clean, groomed and dressed in a black blouse and jeans.\nPatient claimed to have been travelling after graduating college when she was in a car accident 'somewhere outside New Paltz.' According to her delusion, she was taken to 'the Mem' while unconscious. The Mem referred to is a top-secret laboratory run by the government. Patient claims that the Mem held her against her will, and experimented upon her through both surgical and pharmacological means. Patient claims her brain 'no longer looks like a normal human one.' She claims that the Mem was populated with \u2018hundreds\u2019 of people, all without families, who were experimented upon at will. When asked why more people weren\u2019t aware of the Mem, patient replied, \u2018Because they don\u2019t want you to know.\u2019\nPatient claimed to be responsible for the increase in decompensations on Ward because 'that\u2019s what the Mem wants me to do, whether I want to do it or not.' This seems to indicate Patient will need close monitoring to prevent her from taking actions to prove that her delusions are true.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMeredith stood up. She walked toward the door, her face passing through the dusky light. \u201cThis could be the only way to stop it. It might be the only way for me to be stopped.\u201d\nTerrance reached for her. The razor-wire slashes of light that made their way into the room rolled lovingly over her body. It made Meredith into something more beautiful, maybe a vision of fictions and promises.\n\u201cAre you insane?\u201d Terrance cried, \u201cThey\u2019ll\u2026\u201d\nHe let the statement trail off.\nShe smiled an ivory slash amidst shades of gray. \u201cAfraid to give up your life?\u201d\nHe looked at her, pleaded with his eyes. Another impact shook the door. The crack got larger, extending the hairlines to the window frame itself.\n\u201cThere\u2026\u201d Terrance said, suddenly aware all of the white noise beyond the room, a choir of pre-lingual grunts that drowned in their own meaninglessness. He looked around frantically for a solution. \u201cThere\u2026 has to be a better way.\u201d\nThe glass broke inward. The chicken wire held everything but the tiniest granules of glass in place. A shred of bloody flesh hung off one jagged angle. The grunts were turning to screams. The door shuddered in its frame as one, then another, then another of the transformed patients threw themselves against it. Terrance instinctively looked to his desk. He saw his personal items: the picture of someone he thought he was going to grow old with, a few toys, the stress beanbag \u2014 and realized these were all useless elements now.\n\u201cI'm going to let them in,\u201d Meredith was saying, \u201cI just hope it\u2019ll be quick. I don\u2019t think I'd mind a lot of pain if it was over quickly.\u201d\nTerrance heard her footsteps approach the door. There was a crack like a rifle shot when one of the panels splintered. He got to his feet and scrambled to where Meredith was, hands reaching for her wrists, looking to pull her back.\nIn the back of his head, he fantasized about throwing her against the wall. Repeatedly. It\u2019s just that weird effect talking, he warned himself, and for a split second wondered how long ago he had taken the sedatives.\nMeredith flinched when he touched her. With a grunt indistinguishable from the ones outside, she pushed backwards, leading with her sharp, angular knees. Terrance went back a few steps \u2014 long enough for Meredith\u2019s hands to grip the doorknob.\nTerrance heard a whisper in the back of his head, louder than the cacophony of guttural voices and the sounds of meat hitting hard wood. It whispered and calmed and instructed him, pointing out all the objects on hand he could pick up and use. He shifted, reached for the stone paperweight he kept on his desk. In the dusky light, it was little more than a shadow given form. But its cool smoothness felt good in his hands as he advanced on her.\nThe sound of the doorknob turning was like thunder, loud in Terrance\u2019s ear and reverberating in his skull.\n\u201cThis is for the best,\u201d Meredith said, still facing the door.\nAs Terrance reared up, the paperweight gripped so tightly in his hands that his knuckles were white.\nThey came through like a wave just as Terrance brought the heavy stone down on the girl\u2019s head. The residents effected by her siren call came flooding in, their weight and smell overwhelming Terrance, the coppery tang now filling the air, suffocating him. He fell back under their weight, in a difficult tangle of groping, thrashing limbs. But he continued striking them with the rock, feeling the impact down his wrist and up his arm, feeling the warm wet droplets on his fingers and the back of his hand. There was pain as their fingernails dug into his flesh, and the world turned red when someone bit his earlobe and ripped it free.

Six places where the blood pooled too close to the surface, the sick, purpled mottling blooming across pale flesh. She was hungry, but she would not eat. Beneath, her bones pushed against wasted meat. It didn\u2019t like when she went without food.\nHer palm pressed tight against her chest, she traced her fingertips along her sternum, let them drift across the protruding rib bones. She counted them, wondered if with enough pressure, she could draw them out, release them from her thin cage of skin. If she did this, would it finally stop? Or would the marking linger on her decomposing body, a reminder even to the dirt that she was different, a thing separate?\nOnce, when she was a girl and the bruising had just begun, she\u2019d found a slug and carried it home, her fingers aching from such a delicate touch. Later, she would eat it, taking small, neat bites. If she could fill her body with something else, something distinctly not Violet, perhaps the marking would pass over her, but the next morning the bruises had multiplied, and her mother smiled to see them.\nHow old had she been the first time? Five? Six? There were flashes of dark woods, the trees stretching jagged limbs against blackened sky, and the moon always absent. She could not remember it all. Hushed whispers, grunting. A great slab laid out before a hulking figure carved from stone. It would be years before she knew the correct word. Altar.\n\u201cMarked,\u201d her mother said each time, her fingers tracing the marred flesh. Over the years, Violet learned to hate her mother\u2019s touch, but she willed her body to hold still, to curl into itself, a small quiet thing in the face of her mother\u2019s fever bright eyes.\nAt first she had asked questions, but her mother would go silent, her eyes twitching away, searching for something beyond the physical space they occupied. But at night Violet listened. She tiptoed through shadow to her mother\u2019s room, pressed her ear against the door, and waited. If her mother ever dreamed of it, of the thing, its name never manifested. There was only silence in the great house, the rooms too large and menacing in their emptiness.\nShe would think of the woods then, those dark trees pressing down against her as she looked into the ancient stone face of something that had once worn the flesh of humans. But it had never been human. Even in her faded memory, Violet had the sense that it was much, much older than man. Older perhaps, than even her mother had ever imagined.\nBut she wasn\u2019t a girl any more. Had not been, in fact, for many years. She had moved out of her mother\u2019s house at seventeen, worked double shifts down at Fast Eddie\u2019s to cover rent on a shitty one-bedroom apartment that smelled of cooked cabbage and cigarettes. Somehow, fifteen years passed, but the marking had never stopped. Starving herself seemed to keep it at bay, but the markings had begun coming closer together. What had once happened once or twice a year was now happening once a month. Fear curved like a hard stone in her belly.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cViolet.\u201d The voice filled the room, came from both beneath and above her. The shadow was on the ceiling now. Had it come from the window, or had it always been there? Watching, waiting for her to finally notice its slow, calculated creeping?\n\u201cHello, Mother,\u201d Violet said, and the voice chuckled, a deep, rasping wheeze.\n\u201cNever could fool you. Always watching me with those big eyes. Like you were drinking the whole world with them.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t eaten, Mother. For a long, long time.\u201d She offered up an emaciated arm.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anymore. Be a good girl and take off the blanket.\u201d\nFor a moment Violet considered not obeying, thought about running from the room to her car and driving until the tank ran empty or until her organs finally shut down. Flesh and bone mangled up with steel and rubber. But it hadn\u2019t mattered in the past. Certainly, it wouldn\u2019t matter now, and there was so little of her left. She had made sure.\nShe kicked at the quilt that covered her, pushed it down so that her naked form lay exposed. Warm, fetid air wormed over the soles of her feet, up and across her thighs, the concave bowl of her belly.\n\u201cFlesh of my own. Blood of my own,\u201d her mother said. The shadow was no more. Only her mother pressing against her, stretching her form to fit into Violet\u2019s. Her dark hair flowing across Violet\u2019s chest, spilling over her face. Their palms flat against one another, and then her mother\u2019s mouth forcing her lips apart. She smelled of earth, of something that had come from beneath the ground.\n\u201cFeed me. This last time,\u201d Mother said.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHer mother ran on all fours, on impossibly long limbs with joints crooked upward. Violet wanted to scream, but she feared that if she did her mother would turn back, would look at her from a face that she didn\u2019t recognize. The thought terrified her. She kept moving. She knew the way.\nThe great stone loomed ahead of them, and her mother slowed. She turned away. She did not want to see its face.\n\u201cLook at Her, Violet.\u201d\nSome animal cried out into the night, a long screaming that set her skin crawling.\n\u201cThe Great Worm,\u201d her mother whispered and crept forward, curled herself against its feet, ran her fingers between her legs.\nThe statue leered down, the body and face of a woman, the mouth opening impossibly large, rows and rows of pointed teeth crammed into the space. A vortex of razor blades that went on and on. It was a mouth of violence. A mouth that hunted out soft flesh and attached itself there, suckled until it was satiated.\n\u201cFrom the beginning, She wanted you,\u201d her mother said, \u201cMarked you as Her own, and She paid me for bringing you. She let me see things.\u201d\n\u201cPlease. Don\u2019t,\u201d Violet said. She was so tired. She lay down, pressed her hands against the hard earth.\n\u201cThere is a hole in the bottom of the world,\u201d her mother panted, writhing under that gaping mouth.\n\u201cYou know that moment before you fall asleep? That moment where you feel yourself falling? All the earth suddenly drops away into nothingness? That\u2019s the hole opening. You\u2019re feeling Her move,\u201d she said.\nThe stars blazed, a piercing white light that bored into Violet\u2019s skull, burned ghostly images against her retinas. She clawed at her eyes, and her stomach heaved.\n\u201cAnd now, it\u2019s time.\u201d Her mother grasped her, dirty fingernails pressing into pale flesh. \u201cFeed me, my love. My little daughter. Feed me now.\u201d She pressed her mouth to her daughter\u2019s abdomen. An unnatural heat that pulsated in time with her heart grew under her mother\u2019s tongue.\n\u201cIt was you, wasn\u2019t it? It was always you. The marking,\u201d Violet said, and wrapped her fingers in her mother\u2019s hair, tried to pull her away. Her arm was so heavy, and her mother was too strong. There was only the movement of her mother\u2019s mouth, the baring of teeth as she suckled, the burning as blood rose to the surface.\n\u201cShe\u2019ll take me now. And the hole will open once more. Will open wide, and She\u2019ll take it all, everything tumbling into that great void until She\u2019s the only thing left. The way it once was. The way it should be. And I\u2019ll stand with Her as the world implodes.\u201d\nAbove them, the great stone eyes stared down, blank, unseeing orbs, and around them, all had fallen silent. Deep down, in the places where shadows slept, the world shifted, as something great and powerful came awake. Violet closed her eyes and let her hand fall from her mother\u2019s hair. Her mouth tasted of blood.\n\u201cThese are the small ways we die, Violet, her mother said, traced her tongue against Violet\u2019s skin. \u201cEvery day, another part of us rotting. Bags of meat and bone. But you have fed me. You have fed Her.\u201d\nThen the great mouth opened, wide rows of teeth gleaming unnaturally white against the grey stone. The empty stone eyes looked down at the two women lying in the dirt. One crouched before the other, arms and legs tangled together.\nWhen the entire world began to scream, Violet opened her mouth to add her own cry in the dark. Everything slipping away, land bleeding into sky, and something vast creeping toward the surface. She did not want to see, so she shut her eyes, closed them tight as she had when she was a child.\n\u201cIt was always you. I didn\u2019t even know to hate you for it,\u201d Violet whispered.\nHer heart fluttered against her ribs, a frenetic, broken pumping that hitched her breath, left her gasping, her head a light, airy thing. For a moment, she floated, her body untethered from the earth, and she opened her eyes and saw.\nEverything She had ever wanted. The large eyes of a small girl, her pale, fragile body stretched before Her, a vessel to fill. Rebirth. A doorway. And the dark-haired woman so willing, so eager. She brought the girl, weakened her, marked her as Her own. And now, She would use the girl one last time.\n\u201cShe never wanted you, Mother,\u201d Violet said, and laughed. She whispered it again and again. She never wanted you. She wanted me.\n\u201cOf course She wanted you. From the very beginning,\u201d her mother said.\nViolet shook her head, the effort knifing through her. \u201cNo. It was only me. Only me. I can see now.\u201d\nAbove them, the blank orbs stared down, and the mouth opened ever wider.\n\u201cToo late. Too late,\u201d Violet said, and her heart shuddered, the speed too much to bear. Once. Twice. As the moment came, she smiled. There would not be enough left. Only a pile of skin and bone, a smeared reminder of what she had once been.\nAnd then there was nothing remaining. Only a mother clutching her daughter to her chest as she screamed into a world fallen silent.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue27\/3lbe27_story2.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"Violet woke up with the bruises.

Not trusting Ezekiel or Hiram \u2014 who mean well, but they are clumsy \u2014 I gave them the metallic parts to look after; but made sure to keep the Anning Lens myself, detached from the rest of the \u2019Scope, wrapped in two pillows and in all the clothing I had to hand beside; I fear the coachman, a devout Mormon, turned quite pink at the glimpse of my bloomers; yet I could little afford concern on this point, for I spent the entire trip, from Salt Lake City to Fillmore, bent over that bundle like a mother hen, straining to fend off catastrophe. It was exhausting, but the integrity of the lens has been maintained; a result more due to luck than to my stewardship, for it is a wonder that anything in that carriage is still in one piece after the mad jostling we suffered across so many false turns. Zeke and Hi are still complaining about their aching muscles. My very hat was dented and ill fits me now. At any rate, your investment is secure. We lost but one fitting, and Hiram avows it will be easy to improvise a replacement.\nThe reason for our unstinting speed \u2014 and I fear you will see the expense in the attached invoice, listed as a \u201cDoucement to the Stage Driver\u201d \u2014 is that word was already spreading on the train from Kansas City that Eccleston was also en route to the Shales, with a full team, and in Salt Lake we missed him by no more than an hour. It was my concerted aim to make up for time through sheer speed, and so achieve the best location along the Valley, but he outfoxed us. I have no doubt that he may have even bribed our coach driver to take an especially bumpy route, and to get lost three times (as he did) in an attempt to break the Paleoscope before our team even arrived. I am not without intelligence concerning our rival, however; a baggage handler at the station noted that, among Eccleston\u2019s team\u2019s equipment, there was a \u201cman-shaped suit of bronze and iron\u201d that seemed \u201cstudded with gears along the back.\u201d He also reported a small portable-looking stove with what sounded like arm-straps, and it seems clear that Eccleston has not only brought his Armature, but that he has somehow induced it to run on steam power instead of springs. How I wish I had left Ohio even a day earlier! When I think of the damage he will do to the Pratt Shale!\nAnd not, perhaps, just to the Shale. The selfsame baggage handler (easily bribed with a cigarette and a turn of my ankle; no charge) reported that among Eccleston\u2019s equipment, he observed several pounds of dynamite. This could be the Wolverton Quarry all over again, only now we are in the Wild West, and who knows what ill could transpire here, how many fossils and people he could destroy from sheer professional jealousy? Rest assured that our entire team is armed and watchful. We have tricks of our own.\nIn any event, we have set up our own camp discreetly, a mile and a half south of Eccleston\u2019s and away from view. We are smaller, and move lightly, and I have some suspicion that he may not even be aware that we are here, and so near to him; for the sound of his Armature is a blight on the entire valley, sending a hammering cacophony that a deaf man could hear all the way from Skull Rock Pass. Rest assured; the Paleoscope and Lithotome will prove the more cunning and useful devices; and I guarantee we will uncover and assemble an echinoderm fossil before Eccleston\u2019s team manages the same, no matter what ruses he employs to delay us. I was plucking icthyosaurs from seaside rocks ten years before he even knew what a trilobite was, or which end of it was which. In short, although he has made a head start, in the end, the scientific journals will hear of helicoplacus grandhaveni long before whatever it is Eccleston is hoping to call his next find. He has a slight edge in the Jurassic, as we have noted; but we shall beat him in the Cambrian!\nWith gratitude for your enthusiasm for this project, and for your willingness to accept such a nontraditional ally as myself in this war for scientific knowledge, I remain, as ever \u2026 etc.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2026It is with hands trembling in excitement that I announce I have found you an exceptional fossil, and one that cannot fail to bring you renown. Let Eccleston have his helioplacus; for I have located a creature unexampled in all the literature, and unprecedented in all conventional morphology; and we have the Paleoscope to credit for the discovery.\nYou should first be apprised that Eccleston knows we are here, and has shown himself to be exceedingly unhelpful and ungenerous, but at least our work has not yet been physically interfered with. When we are done here, my hope is to slip away before he suspects that we have discovered anything. And as of today, that moment may come sooner than any of us expected.\nAs Ezekiel foretold, it was actually very easy to charge the Anning Lens in the desert sun. One unexpected difficulty lay simply in the glare reflected from the shale; and this was easily remedied by covering the Lithotome\u2019s cutting-scaffold with Hiram\u2019s greatcoat. (Ezekiel offered his as well, but we only needed one, and Hiram is the larger-bodied man.) Thus, with the scaffold pressed firm against the cliffside, and working in relative darkness beneath the greatcoat, I was able to use the cosmogenic energies from the Anomaly Boiler to peer through the Lens, layer by layer, as far as two and a half feet into the rock. You were right; even outside the laboratory, shale is an exceptionally sympathetic mineral for these new energies! When we are finally able to cut, I feel certain it will proceed quickly.\nThe initial scanning would have seemed slow progress to an outside observer, for the Boiler makes for hot work, and we are already in the desert, and we must take breaks every twenty minutes to allow the device to cool down. It is, as you know, far too expensive to replace! (When the stage arrives next week, I will be sure to request more and larger crates of ice \u2014 if any are to be had; and if Eccleston has not outbid us.) Such patience is surely worth it. For whatever progress Eccleston makes with his battering and cutting, he cannot have found what I have: I call it Anomalocusta, for it resembles no lobster science has ever seen. And best of all: it is intact.\nIt remains in the rock, of course, and removing it thence will be the Lithotome\u2019s job. But for now I can see the entire fossil through the Lens and here is my first attempt at a description: it is a long jointed-plate arthropod rather like a lobster or a shrimp, but larger than either, exceeding three feet from head to tail, making it far and away the largest Cambrian creature ever recorded by science. Unlike a lobster, it has no claws or other limbs. In its body shape it resembles a large trilobite whose segments have been flattened and stretched and transformed into underwater wings. Its head is the most disturbing feature, for it has a demonic shape, and possesses \u2014 I should say possessed \u2014 two large hooklike fangs over six inches long, which look capable of cracking open shells and armor, and it boasts two large compound eyes on stalks \u2014 but unlike the tiny beady eyes of the lobster, these are large and pale and eerie, resembling searching headlamps. Finally, and most disconcertingly, it has a thin, needlelike proboscis that extends from between the fangs. This proboscis looks long, soft, and prehensile \u2014 an odd thing indeed to see coming from such a stiff armored creature. The Anomalocusta must have undulated through the primoridal seas with great speed and indifferent grace, like some mechanical insectlike manta ray \u2014 but what could it have fed upon? I would send my rough drawings of the Anomalocusta, but I do not want to risk the mail being waylaid by Eccleston\u2019s agents. I will send them when I judge myself to be in a more secure locality.\nIn case you are wondering why I have not appended a species name to this creature\u2019s taxonomy yet, it is just this: after years of sending you dozens of new fossils, which you have been only too happy to classify and take credit for, I feel I have earned the right to some modicum of recognition for my tireless work. I know that I am but a modestly educated woman, and no proper scientist as the Geological Society recognizes such. Yet from my childhood by the shore I have shown, have I not, for over two decades that I understand the care of fossils, the reconstruction of organisms, the importance of a subtle eye and a care for stinting detail. And I have reliably sent you all my latest finds for a dozen years when your rivals have offered me bribes and other inducements to send them elsewhere or to lose them entirely. I have resisted, not only because of the esteem in which I hold your work, but out of loyalty to you, for first recognizing that I was more than some mere girl playing at the beach.\nThis new fossil will be studied for a millennium, and if I am ever to achieve even the merest hat-tip from the academic community, it would be an honor to have it attached to this discovery. I hope you will consider naming it Anomalocusta cardanelli \u2014 or, if you should choose to name it after yourself, that you would allow me at least the honor of publishing the paper, so that my name, too, will appear with it always: \u201cAnomalocusta grandhaveni (Cardanell 1888).\u201d Does that not look elegant, both our names in equal balance for the first time?\nI hope that you will give my request all due and serious consideration. I remain, as ever, your loyal assistant and fellow explorer in the realms of science. And now I shall return to the discovery \u2014 which, I remind you, is a creature that only I, in all of human history, have ever seen. Sincerely, etc.\u2026\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2026We were attacked in the night. It was to no real effect, however unsettling it was to wake up to; Hiram and Zeke report that they heard the smashing outside their tent, and moved to stop it, but someone had tied the door-flaps shut, and it took too many minutes to cut their way out with a penknife. By the time the two had found a way out of the tent, our attackers were gone. In their wake, we found our food scattered, our horses shooed into the wilderness, and the research tent\u2019s poles and lines were broken, so that the tent itself was just a heavy flat canvas, lying atop a small library, a desk, and some low tables. Nothing priceless was damaged, but many inexpensive conveniences must now be replaced.\nI seem to have slept through it \u2014 I even slept through Zeke\u2019s attempt to wake me up and tell me about it \u2014 but when I did finally emerge into the afternoon, I was irritated, but not despondent. Everything important was still safe. Zeke and Hiram dismantle the Lithotome every night, and secret the parts beneath their beds in their tent. Those were unharmed. And in any event, all the vandalism in the world cannot destroy knowledge, once it is published.\nFrom a certain perspective, this is all perhaps a good sign. Eccleston seems to have discovered that we made an excavation, and he must be murderously jealous of our advancement against his own goals. The precision of the Paleoscope and the Lithotome have proven themselves superior to Eccleston\u2019s wild pneumatic battering of rocks.\nNo harm befell either the Paleoscope or the Anomalocusta (still no species; I await word from your silent pen.) Aside from this, there is little else to report except that I had an unnervingly vivid and unusual dream last night, wherein I was an ancient sea creature, tumbling through the Cambrian depths, seeking something I knew not what. I spent the entire dream waiting, as if I were a clenched fist, and when I awoke, my neck and jaws ached, and ache still. No doubt due to Eccleston\u2019s presence and the importance of this find, this dig carries more than the usual amount of strain. The enclosed invoice includes an order for headache-powder.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2026Oddly, we have had scant trouble of late from the enemy camp. Hiram reports that Eccleston has found something \u2014 not my lobster fossil, but something flat and still in the cliff wall; perhaps its double? \u2014 and he studies it for hours, as if he were reading a sacred text, or listening for the subtleties of a poem. His head angles to the sun, so perhaps what he studies is something he can only see on the surface in a certain light. Whatever it is \u2014 and the chance of it being another Anomalocusta seems slim indeed \u2014 it is a bewitching distraction that the rest of his crew find tedious to watch. Some of the men wander over to our camp to chat with some of our workers. They are rarely missed these days.\nAs for myself, I continue to have the same vivid dreams, only the more I experience the depths of the ocean, and these hours of predatory searching, I can sense that I am not hungering in the typical sense of the term; it is as if, in this dream world, what I live on is actual will; I derive sustenance from overriding the choice of other fish and living beings. I thrive through controlling them, and inducing them to attack one another. Is it possible that these creatures sustained themselves in this fashion, being not mere lobsterlike organisms but creatures of profound intelligence and tyrannical power? This may seem like irresponsible speculation, I allow. But after all, did not Louis Agassiz derive the complete structure of one of his fossils by dreaming about it? Perhaps there is more wisdom in the freeing of the unconscious mind than our young science knows. I hope this is so, for the headaches are growing worse.\nAs a result of the vividness of these dreams, today I overslept, and woke up hungry. I went through three rations of meat while the men looked on, nervous about saying anything \u2014 either because of delicacy toward my sex, or because my unladylike manner of eating put them off kilter, I cannot say. I know that I simply dumped the tinned beef onto my plate and ate it cold. I devoured three cans worth ere I could focus.\nThen I went to the Anning Lens and noticed, as if for the first time, the grapholiths, whose tiny line-segment bodies seem to form a tantalizing cuneiform language over the face and body of the fossil proper. It sounds ridiculous to suggest that these creatures represent an actual alien tongue made up of their bodies, but I cannot shake the suspicion. If the Anomolocusta were as inteligent as I\u2019m beginning to suspect, is it so unthinkable that they might have had a language? And if they were larger than the largest trilobites, and ate whatever they wanted at will, is it not possible they might have also indulged in slavery over smaller creatures? The more I look at the grapholiths, the more convinced I am that their dead bodies spell out something important. I am making notation now of their positions, for I have some suspicion that one day I will come to the lens and find they have moved.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhile I do not know what it may mean in the greater future, for now it appears we have the upper hand. Eccleston\u2019s camp is in utter disarray, owing to Eccleston\u2019s own increasingly aberrant behavior. Most of his men, numbering six in all, have defected to our camp, and tell tales of Eccleston ignoring everything, frozen in his Armature in front of the shale wall for hours on end, then suddenly whirling with great violence and abuse. With his pistons, he hurled an entire pile of timber at the horses \u2014 timber intended to keep the shale stable in the event of further digging. One man was contused, a second was knocked senseless and still has not awakened. Whatever has driven him to this wildness, the exertion did not abate his rage, and he used the hammering-arm of his Armature to crush one of the camp\u2019s dogs. \u201cI cannot believe you didn\u2019t hear it,\u201d Zeke told me. \u201cIt made a terrible, piercing sound all across this valley. The poor creature suffered for over an hour.\u201d I am told that you may still hear random smashing and clattering from the camp, as Eccleston paces. Perhaps it is a problem with his machinery, and he cannot turn off the engine. One hopes he will run out of steam anon.\nAll this I have learned from Zeke by hearsay. I admit I have been less attentive to camp matters, or even to personal ablutions, than I had been formerly. And the reason is simple: the grapholiths are a language. More than this: I am deciphering it! It may perhaps sound strange to you, but when I stare at this unsettling creature, I can almost feel it talking. I have taken to sleeping with it underneath my pillow, and something about that action \u2014 surely a response to primitive ritual wisdom of some sort \u2014 when I awake, it makes ever more sense. Last week, it became clear that the letterforms \u2014 whose shapes resolved into verbs and nouns very easily due to some mixture of my own feminine intuition and the clarifying focus of slumber \u2014 were spelling out an actual sentence akin to we sleep and wait for our time. But now, with more careful consideration and looking further at these shapes, it is clear that these letters indicate a phrase closer to we are restless and we hunger. If this message was laid down a million years ago by these creatures themselves, employing some system of cunning that we can barely conceive, how much more restless and hungry must they be now, if they have been frozen all this time? For beings so brilliant, this measure of immobility and helplessness must have led to an especially intense madness. I hope they are truly dead and not merely sleeping. It is tragic to contemplate.\nThe more I observe this fossil, the more I learn about its nature and its life, the more convinced I am that this find will never be equaled. There is no question but that this must bear the name Anomalocusta cardanelli. The only real question is whether you are willing to pay what this earth-shaking find is truly worth, or whether I shall be obliged to turn to a higher bidder to remunerate my studies. You have been silent since my last letter, and I give you no more than two weeks to reply before I resort to other sources of funding.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nToday, while staring at the Anomalocusta, a strange urge overcame me. I was peering into the Anning lens, and I felt a tap on my shoulder. I whirled in shock and anger, afeared that it was Eccleston come to attack me \u2014 but it was only Zeke, who frowned at me and said, \u201cMiss Cardanell? Shouldn\u2019t you be getting to bed?\u201d\nOutside the tent, it was now night, and I hadn\u2019t even noticed the time passing. Quite literally the last thing I remembered was waking up at noon \u2014 I\u2019ve been oversleeping regularly, of late \u2014 and then bringing the fossil underneath the light of the Anning Lens to examine its many-layered mysteries. It felt as though I\u2019d barely begun to understand what I was looking at, and yet it was evening now.\nI hadn\u2019t eaten all day, and Zeke had thoughtfully brought me some stew left over from dinner. I ate it on my stool, straight from the pot, in the amber light of the Lens. Zeke perched across from me on a spare cot, looking fretful. He is a young man, and touching in his worry, and yet for some reason I found his behavior so annoying that at one point, as I was withdrawing the fork from my mouth, I was seized with the urge to take the fork into my fist and plunge it into Zeke\u2019s forearm. It would be so satisfying to break the skin, I thought, with thoughts that were at one time not entirely mine, and yet at the same time utterly natural and primal. I felt so pent up in every way by my sex and my station, struggling to be heard by louts so utterly beneath me in ambition and native quickness. How satisfying it would be to just slip expectation and stab poor innocent Zeke. To plunge something sharp into something soft and startled. The blood flying away would prove I was the stronger, and not to be ignored. \u201cMiss Cardanell?\u201d he asked, and I looked up and realized I had the fork poised in my fist after all, and I had been staring. I apologized to Zeke and returned to my stew. It was cold by then, but I thanked him anyway.\nI have wrapped up the fossil again and have replaced it beneath my pillow. I am finishing this note as I prepare for bed, and will post it in the morning in order to mark the moment with just the merest note of concern. Although I have always been a very private person, and have survived many extended digs, perhaps here I have been too isolated for too long. I know this much at least: tonight\u2019s dinner has done nothing to slake my hunger.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThis will be the last letter you receive from me. I am no expert in munitions, but there is no one left alive to assist me, and I have arrayed the dynamite to the best of my ability, based primarily on my memory of Eccleston\u2019s destruction of Wolverton Quarry. I hope the Shale is buried in the blast. I send you this letter now to explain why any thing that survives yet this discharge must be subsequently destroyed. Expend your entire fortune to ensure this if you must.\nWhat I recall is just this: amidst yet another dream \u2014 one where, this time, I had actually seized a small swimming creature and was killing it with my proboscis, enjoying the thrill as it thrashed on the end of my fangs \u2014 I awoke, and discovered that I was strangling Zeke, whose body was already cooling beneath my hands. I was outside, under the stars, and I hadn\u2019t even remembered moving. It is possible that I have been sleepwalking for weeks. Who knows how much of this camp\u2019s destruction has been my own doing while I slept?\nAs I dropped Zeke\u2019s body in horror, I saw two other dead bodies nearby: two of the new men who had joined us from Eccleston\u2019s camp. I didn\u2019t even know their names, but between those two and Zeke, I would seem to have killed the entire night watch. My arms were visibly bruised, and my sleeves torn, probably from their struggles to survive me. I felt, and feel, no pain.\nAs I reeled from this horror, a cry went up from one of the men in the outer tents, apparently awakened by our struggle. I thought he was warning the few remaining workers against me, but I heard a clanking noise, and Eccleston appeared over the low ridge, still in his steam-pumping Armature. (According to reports, he has not been detached from it for over a week.) Hiram fired his rifle, and a good deal of blood appeared at the top of Eccleston\u2019s scalp, but Eccleston did not slow down, and it was then that I noticed the gore on the end of his pneumatic claw. I knew then that no one would be found alive in the other camp. Not even an animal.\n\u201cI am restless,\u201d he said, in a voice that was not quite human: an older voice, one so patient and commanding it was all the more terrifying for being merely spoken.\n\u201cI hunger,\u201d I replied, in a voice not my own, and against my will. That is when I knew that Eccleston had indeed found another slumbering monstrosity, and that they were playing us against each other. I could feel it giving them strength.\nAs I ran away to protect the Paleoscope, I heard men crying out, and I knew the Armature\u2019s hammer and claw were being deployed against the few good people we had left. It was then that I noted the pickaxe resting by the tent wall, and some primal urge took over. To this moment, I cannot say how much will I possessed. It felt as if I were entirely in control of my faculties at the time, but I do not remember choosing.\nPlease do not ask me to describe in detail what happened next. It should suffice to know that, after Eccleston, or what was left of him, had destroyed the men remaining in my camp, he came through the tent, the whole tin man of him, as I had known he would, in pursuit of the Paleoscope. If he had reached it, I do not know what would have happened. Some unholy completion of power, no doubt: a steam-powered strength and electrical vision that might have returned those ancient tyrants into control of our world. For whatever reason \u2014 perhaps by dint of my lifelong resistance to authority \u2014 I managed to swing the pickaxe. Eccleston was already dead, and difficult to destroy, but in my rage I managed to swing several more times. I can barely contemplate, much less detail, the bloody scene that presents itself to me now. If this is what a battlefield looks and smells like, I cannot say why more soldiers are not driven insane at the spectacle.\nI alone survive, and I cannot say how long my will can remain my own. Certainly I will need to sleep anon, and this means time is short. I am leaving this letter, addressed to you, under a rock very far from the camps, and marked with a high flag. Everything else, Lord willing, will be burned in a huge conflagration that I pray will inspire more fear than curiosity. (No doubt this was Eccleston\u2019s original aim \u2014 to destroy the site once he\u2019d removed enough fossils to beat your own collection. It is ironic that I should end my career, and my life, by fulfilling his perverse wish.)\nI can only hope this plan of mine will succeed, and everything will be destroyed, including myself. But if you should happen to see me again, know that it is not me. Shoot to kill, and do so ruthlessly, as many times as possible. Use kerosene and a shovel on my remains. And in the name of all that is holy: dig my grave deep.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue23\/3lbe23_story1.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"I wish I had better news about the dig, but ere I relate that tale, I would be remiss if I did not assure you that the Paleoscope and Lithotome have made the journey to Utah fully intact, though it was a hard thing those last hundred miles by stage.","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/xBjcxFDOAkV7C+zRbk1wVO3uX7E.json"}

And she knelt upon them here.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIn them, soldiers slept all around her. (Or did not sleep, as their conditions dictated: tossing and murmuring instead in feverish pain, wearing a rut in the night that they would follow all their lives to come\u2014bad night after bad night\u2014restless and sleepless, pain-gathering and guilt-gathering, until their nightmares harried them into the arms of some fatal numbing relief: alcohol, opium, self-mortification, pessimism, misanthropy\u2014)\nSo too had Sleep and Death wrestled over the slain Sarpedon in ancient Greece: those winged twins in identical tunics, helms and sandals, shown always working in tandem, one at the head and one at the feet, the fallen naked soldier draped senselessly between them.\nLotte Heine had seen such an image once on a brass tavern spittoon that some jokester had painted in mimicry of a red-and-black clay krater. And she had wondered: How to tell the difference between them? How to tell each identical twin from the other, Sleep from Death or Death from Sleep, as they manhandled the fallen soldier on the field?\nBut here, sleep was nothing like death. For death, at least, was quiet\u2014\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBut at night, with blue shadows softening his hardness, he looked like an angel. (Not like a cherub, nor like the clean-shaven archangel Michael who gazed down benevolently from the windows in Sankt Monika\u2019s: but something like a Hebrew angel perhaps, how Lotte imagined the earthy angel who wrestled with Jacob must have looked.)\nMost of the soldiers looked similarly angelic in the cold and eerie hours just before dawn, once they had worn themselves out and stopped their thrashing and moaning, in those darkling hours that belonged only to the night nurse and the night watchman, before the rooster crowed, before any others were awake and working.\nAnd it was in these hours that Lotte Heine retrieved the small silver lacrimarium from inside her frock, and knelt at the bedside of some angel-looking youth, and pressed its cool rim against his quivering dewy lashes, and drew from the corner of his sleeping eye the bitter black tears of the hate and fear and despair that tormented him during the day\u2014\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n(After all, her grandfather had done as much during her girlhood whenever he passed a stone, trousers untied as he staggered from kitchen to yard, flinging crockery and violently verdamming all that his eyes fell upon, sweat streaming from his bald head, face contorted in pain. Her grandmother smothering him with her body, her small frame heaved and hauled along with his every twitch and contortion, sometimes for hours and hours on end\u2014)\nLotte Heine did not consider herself brave either. Not even when she was called to wrap her own arms around a straining soldier\u2019s neck and hold him flat against the boards, a wooden broom handle mashed between his teeth and stark fear in his eyes as the surgeon rasped the sawblade lightly across a shin above a blackening foot, preparing to pitch into his work\u2014\n(Her own father had winced and gurgled too in her arms, twice a day as she hauled him from bed to workbench and then from workbench to bed, his broken back and nerveless legs dangling below his waist, pain racking him all the while as he leaned propped against his table, willing his fingers to hold the tweezers steady, willing his eyes to focus through the watchmaker\u2019s loupe, until one day when Lotte Heine had been only fourteen years old, he had caught pneumonia and had never risen from bed again\u2014)\nLotte Heine did not consider herself self-sacrificing either.\nBut the black tears that she drew out of the soldiers in the small hours of the night, she swallowed and bore in her own breast, until she could pray and work and love those tight black pills of hate and bitterness away, dissolving them harmlessly into nothing.\nUntil then, she could feel them under the fatty white expanse of her skin, pushing back against her fingers, those dozens of hard little pellets: bigger or smaller as the case may have been, each one disintegrating slowly inside her, but new ones added on at a faster rate, just as new cots were added to the ballroom floor, new bodies, new shipments of mangled men: those little pills becoming first a double- then triple-loop around her throat under the high collar of her dress, like a long string of pearls wound around her neck and embedded under her skin.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cHssst Gro\u00dfmutter\u2014\u201d came the call from the next cot over. The cot just beyond the one with the bear-faced angel, where Lotte Heine still knelt, her lips drawn flat and tight, her eyes squeezed shut as the sharp black pill slid painfully down her throat toward her breast.\n\u201cHssst Gro\u00dfmutter\u2014\u201d came the call again. Not the angel, not he. The man in the next cot. \u201cGro\u00dfmutter, why won\u2019t you help me too?\u201d\nBit by bit, Lotte Heine shook off the shock of the new pill she had swallowed. It had been such a small one: the angel\u2019s black bitter tears had barely filled a quarter of her thimble-sized lacrimarium, but that did not make it any less difficult to swallow.\nHe was looking better\u2014far better already. That was what made it possible for her to bear this, night after night. Indeed, his face had softened in the lamplight, no longer wearing the pained and cynical look that she had seen gathering on his brow earlier that evening. He would be quiet and beatific in the morning\u2014better able to endure his wounds and focus his energies on healing his body and spirit. Just as the doctors drained cysts and boils, so too the evil venom collecting in the souls of the men must also be drawn away, lest it fester and infect their future lives.\n\u201cI say, Gro\u00dfmutter, can\u2019t you hear me?\u201d\nIt was the same voice again. At its repetition, Lotte Heine began to cough, the icy pain of the new pellet throbbing in her breast. She looked around in the dim light of the ballroom, seeking for the man who kept calling to her. The nerve of the boy! Calling to her even as she knelt there, swallowing burdens that she had never been meant to carry\u2014\nAh, but then, he was only frightened, of course. He was only in pain. And she could bear it better. Always, she had known that, as her own grandmother had known before her. They truly could bear such things far better than these prideful, angry, impatient men\u2014!\n\u201cWhat is it, Liebling?\u201d She called low into the darkened room, fighting down another cough. \u201cHow can I help you, child?\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cHssst Gro\u00dfmutter\u2014\u201d he said again as she bent over his bed. \u201cTake my darkness as well. It suffocates me. It\u2019s drowning me!\u201d\nAs if to punctuate his words, the man gurgled horribly below her, making a dreadful gasping sound. Lotte Heine forced herself to look at his face, though she also was afraid and could not explain why. Countless times she had filled her lacrimarium with the bitter black tears of wounded men, but never before had she been entreated this way. Always, she had done her work secretly, quietly, while the men dozed, heedless of her kindness and sacrifice.\n\u201cI remember you,\u201d said Lotte Heine at last. \u201cI helped carry you in from the ambulance. You were alone in the cart, and looked more mud than man. Don\u2019t they have water at Fredericksburg, I asked the other nurse. Don\u2019t they know how to wash a man before sending him to the hospital by a dusty road?\u201d\nBut her light words did not reflect how she felt in her heart. She did remember the man, but she had always given him a wide berth in her nightly rounds because he made her tremble. Even from the first moment, she had been frightened of him, and him alone, out of all the other wounded soldiers. There was something wrong about that one, she had told herself when she set him down before the doctors. Something wrong deep inside.\n\u201cAll these other men, I see you bending over them every night. Wiping their brows and holding their hands. Even drawing their tears out of their eyes, and swallowing them\u2014\u201d The hard eyes shifted in the night, somehow growing even darker. \u201cWhy not me?\u201d\nBut Lotte Heine made no response. What could she say? That she was too afraid? Too afraid of what she had thought she had seen in him? There was no little black tear to squeeze out of this man. He was solid darkness to the core, and she knew that he would overwhelm her. Though Lotte Heine had borne much in her life, she could not bear all that this man carried with him.\nAnd the man said: \u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Gro\u00dfmutter. But if you listen to my story, I will make it plain.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nTwo\nTell me, Gro\u00dfmutter\u2014Do you know what it means to wake in an ambulance?\nTo begin as a dead thing, a no-thing, an insensate lump of unconscious coldness\u2014\nThen suddenly to be gasping for breath in a covered wagon thick with a fog of flies and gunsmoke? To lie bewildered in that swinging canvas bed, unsure where you are or what is happening, with not even enough presence of mind to form the thought that you might be damned in Hell already, but feeling it\u2014knowing it\u2014deep in your bones all the same, for what other place could be so tortuous and terrible as this\u2014?\nAnd then the wheel of the wagon drops into some hardened rut in the road, plunging the whole conveyance at once down, sharply\u2014along with the bed, and your broken body, and the other patient in the next bed\u2014throwing you all together as the world swings violently against one side of the van, and then against the other\u2014\nBut at least, at that, your pain centers itself. Gro\u00dfmutter, do you understand?\nThe pain reminds you. It swirls like a vortex through the nerves of your body, and cracks like a whip hard against your knee. And mein Gott suddenly you have a knee again! From no-thing you flash into man-thing, then back out again into pain-thing\u2014\nSearing crescendos of it, burning brands thrust through the ragged wound, up into your leaden thigh, forcing a cry from your mouth: the birth cry!\nAnd the gunsmoke\u2014it evaporates along with the rest of the fever dream and those fantasies of Hell. But the flies remain. The flies prove real enough, damn them!\nBear in mind, Gro\u00dfmutter, that this all comes after you have already endured days of battle. Fredericksburg is the name of the town, they might have told you. A good German name\u2014or at least German-sounding, for who knows who really lives there now. You never saw anything of it except shot-up fields and blasted woods. Not even a church steeple or a smokestack above the glowering hills\u2014just cannon shot hissing and skidding across the sky and turf alike.\nAnd don\u2019t forget the wet nights in muddy holes! Not walking patrol, but squatting patrol, like a frightened animal cowering under a hedge, crouching from picket to picket in a void of starless black, navigating not by sight or by sense but by merest chance, ears straining at every breaking twig or rattling rifle for any clue to the next turning\u2014then suddenly the sentinel\u2019s challenge ringing out, close on the right side, confusingly close and confusingly placed, at a position you thought you had already passed, your sleep-addled tongue fumbling to respond with the English countersign but coming back with your own verdammt German mnemonic instead, meant to help you remember the word but the error registering in your brain just a fraction of a second too late as you call out \u201cWarten! Warten! Wait, wait\u2014!\u201d\nThen the searing blast and pop of a blind shot in the darkness\u2014\nAnd curses grinding out from between your lips as you find yourself face down in the mud, hands pressed hard against your thigh, above the knee that feels as though it has erupted, nerves singing through the air in an expanding corona of pain, as the picket from the next regiment of your own goddamned army thrusts a bayonet at you and misses only because of the pitch darkness of the night, stumbling over his own idiotic boots, recognizing at last as he disentangles himself (slowly, slowly, with the elegant patience of immense stupidity) the Union cut of your coat and hat\u2014\nOnly then do you begin the waiting, Gro\u00dfmutter!\nYes, wait days more after the cataclysm for the ambulance to depart, with a bedsheet throttling the life out of your leg, and rumors muttering down the line of wounded and sick men: rumors of the arrival of phantom ambulances that never seem to materialize, and promises that the hospitals of Washington are only fifty miles away. If only anybody would come to take you! If only anybody would take pity!\nI swear to you, Gro\u00dfmutter, there was a moment when a corporal walked up the line, his ridiculous mustache quivering on his lips (a remnant of some kind of obvious ballroom vanity, a thing no less absurd in that godforsaken place than a clean silk necktie on a fur trapper), the corporal barking for head wounds and stomach wounds, taking a man here and there out of order and bearing them off between stretcher-carriers to God knows where\u2014the hospital or the abattoir, at that moment I wouldn\u2019t have cared which it was, only knowing that if my bayonet had still been within reach I swear I should have slit my own belly open from navel to sternum if it meant that I might be taken out of that goddamned line!\n(Don\u2019t be shocked, Gro\u00dfmutter\u2014neither at my language nor my cynicism. I have earned them. It remains to you to take them away!)\nAh, but the horrors don\u2019t stop there. The ambulances are a horror of their own sort. No light in them at all except the sickly yellow glow of the sun through the canvas covering, muddled and diffuse, but making a clear enough backdrop against which to count the clouds of circling flies\u2014droning, droning, all through a fitful, fevered sleep\u2014patrolling for raw flesh like a flock of miniature buzzards\u2014three, four, five, six of them at least!\nYes, that is how I woke, Gro\u00dfmutter. That is what it means to wake in an ambulance!\nBut whether it was morning or noon in that rolling wagon-hold of a Hell, I could not tell. Neither did I know what time during the night the convoy of ambulances had finally carried me away from the battlefield\u2014nor how far along the road to Washington we had traveled already, nor how much father was left to go, nor how soon my sufferings might at last be over\u2014!\nIt would have made no difference to have known, of course. The journey would take as long as it must take, just as it would be my part to suffer as much pain as God has commanded His angels to inflict upon me.\n(Quiet your tongue\u2014there is no blasphemy in that. Did He not do as much to Job?)\nBut my fevered mind seized upon that void of information with the force of a spring trap. How long! How far! How soon! It hardly even mattered what the answer would be. One hour left to go, or one thousand hours: I wanted only some assurance that an end would come at last!\nSome end, any end, to that hellish dry-lipped swaying in a suspended bed, sweat-soaked and blood-soaked and even mud-soaked\u2014the unwashed mud of the battlefield!\u2014my wounded leg seemingly folded like a clasp knife underneath my body, impossible to straighten, heavy as a lead weight, both as cold as steel and yet burning like a brand in the fire\u2014\nI called to the attendant, but there came no reply. I turned my head and saw that there was no attendant there. His stool sat empty. Left alone! Abandoned! With no hand to succor or reassure!\nI laid back, defeated, despairing. The unreasoning fear of being trapped forever in that ambulance swirling in my disordered head, when suddenly\u2014I felt something move in the bed next to mine. Something that moved with a flop\u2014or a slither\u2014\nMy heart froze in horror, but then\u2014of course! The other man!\n\u201cSind Sie wach?\u201d I asked, in both German and English, not knowing whether he was from my own German regiment of Indiana volunteers or from another one. \u201cAre you awake?\u201d The poor wretch! The only other one who could be as wretched as I! What a comfort it would have been to hear his voice.\nBut the only reply was a gurgle, from somewhere around the middle of the bed.\nThe man will die! So I thought. The man would die before we reach the hospital, and there would be no one even to report his name to the death lists. No one\u2014save myself.\n\u201cWie hei\u00dfen Sie?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\nBut the gurgle only trailed off into a quiet bubbling that sent a flight of shivers up my spine. It was, I was certain, the death rattle\u2014\nAh, do not judge me, Gro\u00dfmutter! God only knows why I did it. God only knows why I reached out to pull the blanket away from his face. Some hope that I might look upon humanity again, perhaps, before its feeble flame guttered and died across the van from me.\nBut look I did! Tugging at a corner of the sheet with my enfeebled strength, pulling it taut across the body, then giving at last a hard tug that uncovered the man as far down as his breast.\nI lay transfixed at the sight. Transfixed\u2014and confused.\nIt (you will soon see why I call it that!) was black and red, twisted like a tree\u2019s roots. Mashed like a clod of earth wrested up out of the ground by some giant\u2019s hand. And there, at the top of the body, sat the gulping, gaping hollow of its face-or what I imagined to be its face\u2014\nBelieve me when I say that I wanted only to cover it up again. Believe me that I did not willingly seek to uncover it\u2014this man-thing or pain-thing or some-thing\u2014any further\u2014\nBut as if acting of its own accord, my hand twitched again, pulling at the blanket once more, uncovering it now down to the hips\u2014\nThe hips! Ha, the hips\u2014!\nUnderstand: I have seen men shattered by cannonshot, twisted and thrown, their bodies re-set in fantastic configurations, limbs kinked and innards protruding, every joint and joining dislocated\u2014\nI have seen such sights often enough already (and God save me from seeing any such thing ever again) to know what is a man, and what a man can be made into\u2014\nBut here was what was not a man, nor what had ever been a man, nor what could ever be a man\u2014!\nIt was instead some mass of battlefield itself, the very bloodsoaked battle earth\u2014a splayed ropey clod of black-red clay wound around and around itself like a cannibalistic vine, every cubit infused with human blood, Yank and Reb alike, the blood of four days of battle, the blood let from uncountable veins\u2014\nA dark and alien something, evil and exterminating, that had been taken up, in the haste and confusion of the stretcher carriers, in some gruesome mistake and placed in the ambulance in the bed beside me\u2014\nNo, not a man indeed\u2014a homunculus, perhaps, at best\u2014a monstrous mixture of the animate and inanimate, of life and death, of blood and soil, of sacrifice and saturation\u2014\nAnd mein Gott, Gro\u00dfmutter, it flopped again.\nYes, as I stared in horror at it, the thing flopped.\nEyeless, mouthless, boneless\u2014it slithered on the bed, knotting itself tight, seemingly stretching at the edges, as though fighting back into a shape that it had forgotten to make.\nThe torso, the head, the writhing arms and legs\u2014and for a moment I could see what the stretcher bearers must have seen, a shape almost man-like, almost human! But just for an instant before it squirmed again, disintegrating now into so much struggling clay, seemingly trying to birth itself\u2014to breathe life into its own hollow moveless lungs\u2014\n\u201cDriver!\u201d I called, though I knew no one could hear me over the clatter of the wheels. \u201cDriver, steward! Hilfen mir!\u201d\nFor I couldn\u2019t move. I couldn\u2019t escape. My dead leg pinned me to the bed like an anchor.\nAnd I could feel the battle-born thing across from me beginning to slide over the short distance between us\u2014slowly, horribly, flowing like a bead of hot tar\u2014but so cold! so awfully icy cold! It touched me on the calf and I felt my leg turn to ice. I fought to get away\u2014to roll out of the hammock bed altogether if I could manage it\u2014\nBut I was caught! Pinned! Wrapped up helpless as the coldness descended upon me\u2014\nSwallowing me, feet first, working its way inexorably higher, as something inside of me rose up and surged away from that touch\u2014panicked, terrified, bolting hard for its life\u2014some remnant of peaceful humanity that I had borne somehow untainted inside myself, through months of war and sickness and horror\u2014some flame-bright essence, being squeezed now, like paint from a tube, up and out of my hips, then my stomach, then chest, throat, skull\u2014the pressure building and blinding me as the cool-clay touch of the thing covered over the last inch of my scalp and enveloped me utterly in darkness and death\u2014\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThree\n\u201cIt was a curious sensation,\u201d the soldier said after a long pause, \u201cthe stopping of the ambulance. After what had seemed an eternity of a traveling torment, it was a curious sensation indeed to be still.\u201d\nHis eyes turned to Lotte Heine and regarded her sadly, then dropped down to stare at the lacrimarium that hung from a chain around her neck.\n\u201cYou know the rest,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rolling up of the wagon\u2019s canvas covering, the light steps of your own feet mounting the wagon frame, the stretcher furled on two rods. Then your hands on my body\u2014but a strange numbness there, as though my arms and legs were dead things, like ice-cold pipes, nerveless weights\u2014\u201d\nLotte Heine looked away, in embarrassed pity.\n\u201cFor a moment, it was as if I were watching from elsewhere\u2014watching from the other bed in the ambulance.\u201d His voice was ragged and low, as though spent from the effort of recalling and recounting the horrors he had experienced. Horrors that Lotte Heine did not doubt he had felt keenly\u2014and still felt keenly!\n\u201cI called out!\u201d said the soldier. \u201cDid you hear me calling? From my other place, from the other bed. Calling: \u2018Warten, warten\u2014! Wait! Wait! You\u2019ve forgotten me! Oh, you\u2019ve taken the wrong one and left me behind!\u2019\u201d\nLotte Heine raised her eyes to the man\u2019s face. What was he saying? She remembered the ambulance, and she remembered carrying the man out. He had been the only one. They had searched the other bed for any sign of life, but had found only a mass of blood and dirt.\n\u201cYou did not speak,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cNo one spoke.\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2014\u201d said the soldier. \u201cNot in English. Not in German. I had no lips, of course. No tongue. I was nothing anymore but a few clods of blood-soaked clay, falling to pieces even as you looked at me, losing all form, unable to cohere\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou were on the stretcher,\u201d said Lotte Heine. \u201cI helped to bring you here.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the Thing you bore away. It was the Thing you washed and sponged. It was the Thing you bandaged and dressed, and the Thing you laid in this bed\u2014\u201d\nLotte Heine looked at the soldier, watched the shadows on his face. A chill ran through her body, from her temples to her weary knees.\n\u201cAnd I was left behind. My soul, myself, whatever it would please you to call it. But as you threw open the canvas of the ambulance, I was already whirling up into the sky\u2014blown by a cold breeze, unmoored, unstuck, my final mortal thoughts bubbling away as my consciousness effervesced into a million individual atoms\u2014each one alone too small to sustain an idea or an identity or an id\u2014then scattering, scattering, scattering to the winds\u2014\n\u201cAnd below me, that Thing, with my name and my body in the hospital bed\u2014\n\u201cTo be sent home, to be sent home! Do you hear me, Gro\u00dfmutter? To be sent to my home! To my wife and my daughters and my Indiana farm\u2014\u201d\nLotte Heine suddenly leapt up, grabbing hold of the man\u2019s face, one clammy cheek in each of her palms. He did not look up at her, but instead lay inert in her hands, as if indifferent to her touch.\nShe looked down at the man in the hospital bed, her eyes stinging with tears\u2014sick with exhaustion and pity and fear. It had been the desperate way he had said those words that had pricked her. My wife and my daughters!\nIn his desperation, he had somehow convinced her! Yes, she could believe he was a Thing then\u2014could taste the mud in his mouth, the tang of hatred on his tongue. Gott, it sent a sickness through her! How could she not act? How could she not attempt to wring out the man from the Thing?\n\u201cStop!\u201d she hissed, squeezing his shoulders, unmindful of his strength or weakness. \u201cStop! I\u2019ll do it! For the sake of your wife and your daughters, I will do it! I will make you a man again\u2014\u201d\nHe lay looking at her for a long time, his eyes hooded in darkness as he regarded her. Then the curl of a sneer rippled along his lip as he turned his face away bitterly.\n\u201cHeartless woman!\u201d he muttered. \u201cYou will do it for another woman, to save her from the darkness that holds me. But you will not do it for my own sake. All right! What matter! Who cares for your sympathy? So long as it will be done!\u201d\nThe soldier turned back to face her, his eyes again resting on her lacrimarium, the dark tears already rising to his lids, blotting out the whites of his eyes. And regret already rising in Lotte Heine\u2019s heart\u2014\nFear already rising along with it\u2014\nToo much, too much! It will be too much! She could not swallow all this bitter draught\u2014 She could not bear it for him\u2014Could not\u2014\nBut she could not leave him either.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nFour\nShe returned to her habits, mopping and washing in the houses of the wealthy in the cold mornings, then eating a bite of bread and cheese, or a baked potato in the winter, them home to her own house in the evenings where there was always piecework to be done.\nOn Sundays, Lotte Heine went as always to Sankt Monika Kirche. She stood and sat and kneeled in the back, according to the forms of the Mass. She listened to the prayers and the readings from Scripture. She let her mind wander when the old German priest extemporized his sermons from the pulpit, his voice echoing throughout the church, the words overlapping and reverberating into syllables that had the shape and sound of language, but none of the sense.\nThen afterwards, in the chapel at the back, she lit a candle for her own soul. But where once she would have lit candles as well for her husband and father and grandfather, she now left those wicks to lie black and cold against the wax.\nAll of them, doubtless, were suffering still in the torments of purgatory. All of them, doubtless, were in need of prayers. In need of kindness and compassion. She might easily have added all the hundreds of soldiers she had cared for during the war to their company as well, wherever they were in the world now: back in their own farms and cities, or perhaps in California, or Alaska, or at the bottom of the ocean for all she knew.\nThey each had followed their own roads. Each one had reached his own destination, his own purgatory, either in this world or the next. And as far as Lotte Heine was concerned, she had washed her hands of them all. They had come and now they had gone. And if they didn\u2019t like where they now found themselves, then they could get themselves out if they liked, with whatever centuries of prayer and penance God saw fit to require of them.\nAs she stood before the single sputtering candle, Lotte Heine allowed her eyes to rest upon the icon of Sankt Monika that hung in the chapel. It was bad work, poorly done. A shame to have it in the church. But it reminded Lotte Heine all the same how she had thrown her kindness and compassion away, all through her life, on a succession of worthless men.\nThere would be no canonization for Lotte Heine, to be sure. For Sankt Monika, yes: she who also had cried and prayed and toiled. Indeed, it had been her agony and entreaties on behalf of her seemingly lost son, Sankt Augustine, that she had ultimately been glorified for.\nYes, thought Lotte Heine bitterly. If only her grandfather had been a great man, instead of a common laborer, then perhaps her grandmother would also be a saint now. And if she, Lotte Heine, had given her own patience to some better man\u2014a man! always a man!\u2014then she might look forward to the same. But since she had wept and sacrificed only for ordinary men who failed to rise above their selfish natures, she could expect no thanks, no reward. Bah! What a parade of ingrates she had known all her life. No more! Never again!\nTurning to leave, Lotte Heine suddenly drew up sharply. A woman was blocking her way. Young, it seemed, though it was hard to tell under the habit that was pinned tightly to her skull, the folds of black hanging down to her shoulders and beyond.\n\u201cWon\u2019t you leave something for the order, Gro\u00dfmutter?\u201d\nLotte Heine stood a moment, staring the nun down. She had seen them before at Mass, of course, their identical costumes filling an entire section of the church. Inside their habits, they seemed to be nuns of all types: old, young, fat, robust. But all of them red-faced in health! That felt like an obscenity to Lotte Heine. Shouldn\u2019t a nun be hungrier and angrier and harder worked than she? Shouldn\u2019t a nun have to suffer in life?\n\u201cI think not,\u201d answered Lotte Heine brusquely. She did not care to pretend that she had paid for the candle. \u201cI will not leave anything.\u201d\n\u201cNo?\u201d The nun\u2019s eyes were staring at her, imploring now, with an unsettling intensity. \u201cBut every week I see you light a candle, yet I have never seen you leave a single thing.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you won\u2019t,\u201d choked Lotte Heine, surprised and ashamed to feel something like a sob gathering in her breast. She swallowed it down and spoke again, pressing one hand against her breast as she did so. The hard points of the black beads still embedded all through her flesh pressed back and gave her courage. \u201cNot a single copper penny you\u2019ll get from me, though I live another fifty years.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not a penny that I want from you.\u201d\nAt that, Lotte Heine looked incredulously at what the nun had taken up from the small chapel altar, at what the nun was now pressing toward her. It was a battered silver cup, a larger version of her own lacrimarium. The black beads in her breast were burning now, her nerves tingling from her fingertips to her temples.\nShe had grown used to them, she had thought. Since that night in the hospital, with the soldier from the ambulance, they had stopped dissolving and had seemed fixed in place. They had simply laid there, under her skin, unmoving and unchanging, as if turned to stone. They had become, she thought, hers to bear forever.\nBut now this nun held out a cup for her\u2014!\nLotte Heine shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re too late. I do not cry anymore.\u201d Yet, even as she spoke, there was a quaver in her voice and a prickle at the corner of her eyes. Expectantly, the nun thrust out the cup. But that was all: a quaver and a prickle, and nothing more. Lotte Heine blinked her eyes. The urge to cry had dried up again. \u201cI told you. You\u2019ll get no coins from me, and no tears either.\u201d\nThe nun smiled and lowered the cup, placing a hand on Lotte Heine\u2019s arm. \u201cNot today, perhaps. But if you try, every week, then perhaps\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhy should you want them?\u201d asked Lotte Heine bitterly. \u201cHave you not enough hardship, that you must drink of mine? If it\u2019s salt you crave, there are pleasanter ways to get it. This way, you\u2019ll only end like me.\u201d\nThe nun shook her head and motioned toward the door of the chapel. \u201cNot me. Not alone.\u201d Behind her, at the door, Lotte Heine could suddenly see more clustering heads, just outside the chapel. \u201cYes, today I will drink. But next week, Sister Agnes. The week after, Sister Catherine. Then Sister Agatha, then Sister Magdalene. There are so many of us, all of us ready to do it, Gro\u00dfmutter!\u201d\nAnd suddenly something loosed inside Lotte Heine. She wanted to ask exactly how many there were. She wanted to hear each of their names, the entire litany of compassion. Alone! She had always been so alone, ever since her own grandmother had passed away. Always she had done this work in darkness and isolation, with the windows of her lantern shuttered, while the ones she ministered to slept unawares.\nYet here, it was different. So different! Why had she never imagined there could be another way?\nAnd before she understood what was happening, the silver cup was held up toward her face again. Black tears rolled out of her eyes. One, two, three, four, five\u2026 As they fell trembling into the cup, the nun smiled.\nLotte Heine pressed her hands against her breast again. The black beads still lay there, under her skin. But in one spot, perhaps, they were smaller. Yes! Here, just below her left clavicle, Lotte Heine could feel a new gap: a smooth space where an icy stone had used to sit. She rubbed the spot again and again, amazed to feel nothing but skin and flesh under her fingertip.\nWithout another word, the nun withdrew the cup and carried it out of the chapel. Lotte Heine felt a surge inside herself: a desire to run after her, to call out. To ask her name. But Lotte Heine was too shy and too confused. She only walked to the door of the chapel herself, and peered out through the crack into the church.\nShe could see the nuns beyond, arranged in the pews for their midday prayers. As they awaited the chiming of the hour, they passed the cup from hand to hand, each one sipping, each one drinking. And when the chapel door began to close, about to shut out the scene, Lotte Heine reached out with one hand and stopped it.\nThere she stood, a while longer, before she left for her own house. There she stood, a while longer, before she went home alone.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue31\/3lbe31_story4.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"Lotte Heine had old, bad knees.

Two nights ago, it was my friend Bob Nod, whose impaled head grinned ghoulishly at me and whose open eyes screamed at me as I drove by the Nod\u2019s little cottage on my way to the college yesterday morning. I\u2019ll miss Bob, a regular at church council meetings. As I drove past, I wondered when it would be my turn.\nMy door posts nightly smeared with the fresh blood of doves, I got used to the ritual. When the sun set last night and suffocating darkness fell, I stayed awake, pulse racing with apprehension and excitement, listening to dogs howl, waiting for the great flapping bat-beast to claim another victim, thinking for some reason about Bob Nod\u2019s eyes. Generally, the beast kills three nights in a row, disappears for ten days, and returns for another three-night kill. The victims\u2019 heads are impaled with their eyes open, hideous smiles plastered on their faces. We have all come to accept these facts as inevitable.\nLast night, the darkness was thick as glue, a black mass tangible as soup. Sweat and humidity formed a sticky coat inches from my skin. This didn\u2019t feel like an ordinary evening, and I wondered for a while if I had indigestion. Sick at heart, I spent an hour leaning against the second story window and recalling the past few months.\nNear midnight the wind howled, ominous. Lightening struck in the east and west, and I looked to the mountains in the distance for the Son of Man, an automatic response to some Biblical prophecy I had read long ago. I peered through the darkness, certain something was there. After fifteen or twenty minutes, I made out an object sailing in the sky towards Roseburg and, as it grew closer, I was reminded of a creature from my recurring nightmare: a winged serpent swimming through dark water. Closer still, it hovered over Buck\u2019s house.\nBuck had a shady one-story directly across the street and, I am sure, had been asleep in his big living room chair when the explosive roof-landing of the bat-thing woke him. I could feel the landing from across the street. From my window, I watched the huge, dark-winged beast land. Then, the sky lit by lightening, I watched the beast rip and dig with its claws through Buck\u2019s shingles and drop like a feather through the roof and into the room below. Buck\u2019s screams must have lasted an hour. I waited, wondering if I should run for my own life or call a Priest. The next morning, when I went outside to get the paper, I looked up at Buck\u2019s house. There, in Buck\u2019s front yard, impaled on a pole, was Buck\u2019s severed head, eyes open; it was smiling obscenely. I could swear Buck\u2019s eyes were screaming at me. Weird, I thought.\nThat morning, over coffee, bacon, and eggs, I told Amy what I had seen the night before and mentioned that Buck had probably been terrified when the thing came exploding through his ceiling, sending fragments of plaster flying everywhere. I had seen the whole thing in a dream, I asserted. That much was true. I didn\u2019t tell her about the head.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cMust have scared the shit outa big Buck,\u201d I chortled, munching toast and gulping coffee. Amy knew I hated Buck.\n\u201cNo doubt,\u201d murmured Amy, who was never at her best in the morning. Her eyes burrowed into the obituary section.\n\u201cChomp, chomp, chomp,\u201d I said, thinking of the beast taking bites out of Buck but hoping to amuse Amy. \u201cBuck musta been one tasty pie.\u201d\n\u201cJesus.\u201d Chomp, chomp, chomp. \u201cJesus Christ, you\u2019re hopeless,\u201d she said, glancing up at me, then returning to her reading. I think she wished me dead.\nI smiled. I knew Amy was disgusted, but I couldn\u2019t help myself. The thing would have seized Buck instantly, shattering his bones like a stack of twigs and biting off his head, geysers of blood spraying the walls. I wondered if Buck\u2019s wife or his mother Billy Jo, who had lived with Buck for twenty years, had seen the spectacle and, if so, what they had thought of it. The police showed up two days later, after Buck had failed to phone in at the office. His wife and mother, seated on the couch in front of the TV, were dead, bodies drained of blood.\nThe very next evening after Buck\u2019s death, Bradley Crane bit the eternal dust. An offensive man, Bradley had taught at the local college; we had even shared an office until Bradley had begun to spread the rumor that I was behaving inappropriately with my students. An obese, balding man whose tiny wire-rimmed spectacle made me think of a fat white rat, Bradley generally stayed up until two a.m. I remember the night of his demise, assured even then that I would remain untouched because I had smeared the areas above and to the side of the front door with blood of doves. I watched from my second story window, almost as if I sensed the thing coming, and suddenly heard the overhead whoosh: flying through a darkness as palpable as soup, the thing landed on Bradley\u2019s roof and then used both iron-taloned fists to break away the tiles to get at its victim. It reminded me of a seagull cracking an oyster shell. Yum, yum, I thought.\nI almost cheered for Bradley, as he came crashing through his front window and bolted toward my house, screaming, \u201cSteele! Steele! For Christ\u2019s sake, let me in, let me in, let me in,\u201d all the way down the street. When he was just outside my front door, I yelled at him from the window, \u201cCan\u2019t do it, old man! Can\u2019t fuckin' do it! We lock the doors at ten. Sorry.\u201d I smiled to myself and watched as the huge bat-thing came exploding through the broken window down the block, caught up to its victim in seconds, grabbed head and neck in its talons in a wondrous burst of blood, tore my colleague limb from limb right in my front yard, and spent the next hour or so having Bradley for snacks.\nTo give him credit, Bradley put up a fight, at one point grabbing the thing around the neck; as he struggled. H was shouting \u201cOh, help me, someone! Oh, sweet Jesus, help me, help me, help me.\u201d When I heard his pleas, it occurred to me that Bradley might be religious, and I considered praying for him. The next morning, as I drove past his house to work, I saw Bradley\u2019s head impaled on a pole in his front yard, eyes open, grinning from ear to ear. The eyes were seemed to scream at me.\nBut I get ahead of myself. Something needs saying about Jenny\u2019s parents. When they moved to Roseburg from Boise, Jenny\u2019s father Ted promptly landed a job with a top real estate group and her mother Gracie won a couple million from a lottery with such ease you'd think she did so every week. In a short time, Ted and Gracie were running Roseburg. Naturally, I resented them. I think we all did.\nFour years after Ted and Gracie moved here, Jenny was born, and Pastor Ray \u2014 black\/blind preacher of the eternal gospel of our Lord \u2014 proclaimed during her baptism on a day of impenetrable fog that he could see the Spirit of the Lord resting upon the child. I thought to myself, my hair literally standing on end: Jesus, this Sunday morning service is something right out of the fucking Gospels! The congregation became hushed as Ray immersed little Jenny in water and then held the child over is head for everyone in the church to see. \u201cAnyone who brings harm to Jenny Curtis,\u201d Pastor warned our congregation \u2014 many of whom had already committed abominable sins \u2014 \u201cOn him will the Lord take vengeance seven times.\u201d\nThat day, fourteen years ago, when Ray uttered the curse in his booming Mt. Sinai voice, a shudder went through the congregation, some of whom years later agreed that Jenny should die for us all. I froze. My heart stopped beating for at least a minute. What many took as an expression of Pentecostal paranoia later revealed itself as gospel-inspired prophecy.\nWord of Jake\u2019s supposed decision spread like a cancer in this small town, but no one took it seriously at first. They knew Jake, a muddle-head from birth. He had spent the afternoon of the announcement getting sloshed at Stoney\u2019s Tavern, located just behind the K-Mart on Fourth Street and right next to the fire station. Rumor had it that the proclamation issued from Jake\u2019s table located in the back of the tavern and next to the women\u2019s restroom, that Jake claimed being visited the night before by a dark spirit who had demanded the head and soul of Jenny Curtis. Of course, Jake issued no such proclamation. It was I who had put the notion of the demonic visitation in Jake\u2019s generally pickled brain.\n\u201cA dark spirit, sir?\u201d I asked, looking the red-faced Mullins in the eyes. Jake\u2019s head was slowly nodding as it does after he\u2019s had too many.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Steele,\u201d the dunce of Roseburg slurred. \u201cA dark spirit. Maybe a dark angel. Maybe The Devil. That\u2019s what you said, isn\u2019t it?\u201d More powerful and respected than me, Jake had nonetheless always been dumb as a bag of rocks. A drunk bag of rocks.\n\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd, truth be known, sir,\u201d I added, \u201cI have seen more than one dark spirit in my time.\u201d\n\u201cYou, Steele? You? And what'd you do?\u201d\n\u201cSir, as the saying goes, \u2018don\u2019t piss off the spirits.\u2019 I did whatever they told me.\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. And if the thing tells you to disembowel and impale little Jenny Curtis, then I, sir, would not hesitate to do it.\u201d Jenny\u2019s father was heading a drive to get me fired at the college for indecent behavior.\n\u201cBut Jenny\u2026\u201d the Mayor droned, \u201cis such a pretty girl.\u201d\n\u201cAll the better.\u201d Jake had narrowly defeated Jenny\u2019s father for his position. I thought that making an example of little Jenny would only solidify Jake\u2019s power base and make my position in the community more secure. Besides, it would make me feel better.\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve known the Curtis family since they moved here from Boise. Nice folks,\u201d Jake whined.\nOh, for fuck\u2019s sakes, I thought to myself, calling silently upon the darker powers to persuade this man.\n\u201cTed and Gracie, sir?\u201d I asked. \u201cBoise, Idaho? Those left-wing liberals? They\u2019re straight outa Berkeley. Fuckin' liberal atheists. They wanna destroy Preacher Ray. Not people you can rely on.\u201d After his parents had died years ago, Jake had been raised by Preacher Ray.\n\u201cHuh. Huh. Huh. Damned atheists,\u201d slurred the Mayor. \u201cDidn\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\u201cSatanists, sir,\u201d I added, heaping on coals of condemnation. Jake looked at me with his sad puppy-dog eyes. Roll over, Mush, I said to myself. In private, I called Jake \u201cMush.\u201d\n\u201cBesides, sir, Curtis'd take your job and fry your ass in a minute,\u201d I asserted. \u201che\u2019s tryin' to take my job, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right,\u201d mumbled Jake.\n\u201cOf course I'm right. And Jenny works topless in a bar just outa town, sir. She\u2019s a disgrace. I hear she\u2019s a witch.\u201d\n\u201cA witch that strips?\u201d Jake mumbled, his eyes suddenly fixed on me. I'd hit a nerve. I knew that Jake loved two things in life: the Bible and strippers. Strippers could be Baptist or Pentecostal, but they couldn\u2019t be devil-worshipers.\n\u201cWorst kind of witch, sir.\u201d\nJake paused, grumbled, stared into his glass of beer.\n\u201cAnd sir,\u201d I added, \u201cLet me remind you of the gloriously restored law of retribution.\u201d In a radical move last session, our state had not only brought back the death-penalty, but had done so with a popular vengeance: criminals could be executed in public. I knew I had Jake.\nI made sure that word quickly spread: the Mayor wanted Jenny\u2019s head. Of course, as I said, at first no one took seriously the rumor that Jenny Curtis was going to die for the community. No one, that is, except for black\/blind preacher Ray. A monument to the town\u2019s once steadfast faith, Ray seemed ageless and had been pounding the pulpit of Precious Blood Pentecostal Church for longer than I or anyone else in the community could remember. When word of the Mayor\u2019s proclamation reached him, Ray took note. Predictably, the next few Sundays, Preacher Ray reviled Jake from the pulpit, branding him a puppet and then turning on me, to whom he referred as \u201cevil\u201d and \u201cdemonic.\u201d\nRay\u2019s preaching went on for weeks, day and night, in the tradition of Old Testament prophets. Finally, one Saturday night, six months later, my distant cousin Troy Merchant and his two half-wit sons broke into Ray\u2019s house, killed Ray, his wife, and his dog, and set the house afire. It was a glorious sight, a real crowd-pleaser, and everyone in the town turned out to watch the one hundred year-old Victorian mansion that Ray and his family inhabited consumed in merciless flame. I wondered what the preacher\u2019s last thoughts were before he burned. He probably thought he was going to Hell.\nSix months later, the state\u2019s economy having bottomed out, and the community having reached a consensus that something needed to be done to restore our fortunes; Jenny Curtis was dragged naked and screaming from her house to the village square, while her parents stood by in mute horror. It was a Thursday night, Jenny and her parents sitting at home, watching TV or playing Monopoly or doing whatever Jenny and her parents did on the nights she wasn\u2019t dancing naked. When the doorbell rang at seven and Jenny\u2019s dad opened the door, the callers ran into the house. We forcibly seized Jenny, stripped the screaming girl bare, and carried her out and to the middle of the town.\nJenny\u2019s parents were, no doubt, dumbfounded and helpless at our conviction. That neighbors with whom they had dined and slept and gone to movies would ever believe that the Sacrifice of the Innocent would bring health, wealth, and prosperity to Roseburg. The parents could only watch and follow, I am sure in sickened disbelief, as their beloved Jenny was hauled down Main Street, past K-mart, and tied to the great wooden block in the town square. Like visitors allowed into Hell\u2019s inner circle, they howled like dogs when their screaming daughter was spread and bound by rope, and turned away in beaten silence when the village males mounted and entered her one by one, sometimes two at a time.\nI was near the last, and when I climbed up on the block and looked down upon Jenny, ready to penetrate, into the eyes of a now frightened animal, I smiled and blew her an imaginary kiss.\n\u201cYou\u2019re mine now, you little tramp,\u201d I uttered, getting ready to slip my socket between her legs.\nBut she was not screaming anymore. She looked down at me and snorted, then boldly into my face, and spat. \u201cTake your best shot, little man,\u201d she said slow and measured. My manhood shriveling, I had to zip up, climb down off the block, and simply watch.\nExhausted by the ordeal, Jenny lay on the block, panting heavy like a dying animal, but mouth closed like a sick one that hides its weakness. When they had finished, I looked into her open eyes, saw the smoldering defiance. I slowly backed away.\nShe did not take her accursed eyes away from mine. Not when we unbound her. Or when Buck Tomlinson and I ran the pole into her. Or when the crowd built into a frothing, frenzied chant of death. Or when she tensed her muscles to make the task almost impossible for us. Neither did she grant us another scream, even as Bradley Crane and I lifted the pole. And I only looked away when her struggles quit and her body crept down with gravity, because her eyes were still on mine.\nThe only unwilling participant, Jake stood back and watched. He had, in his lifetime, seen only one impaling and had hoped never to repeat the experience. \u201cOh, Lord, Lord, Lord, have I too done this thing?\u201d I remember he wailed loudly, arms outstretched, face gazing upward. Aware that sacrilege was being committed, wondering if the Creator would be angry, he dropped to his knees, looked to the starry night sky, wept deeply, prayed for forgiveness, cried out to the Son of Man as Jenny died on the pole.\nJenny\u2019s body was left in the square for three days and then, at my direction, her head was severed from her body, which was subsequently tossed into the sea. Jenny\u2019s head was displayed on a post in the Mayor\u2019s front yard for all to see.\nI remember the day we sent Jenny\u2019s body to its rest in the sea. It was a warm day, in the low 80s. Children sang and played in the streets and parks. As soon as Jenny\u2019s body was deposited in the ocean at mid-day, the sky grew black, the sun disappeared, and death descended like a dark cloak upon our community. Standing on a cliff overlooking the ocean, wrapped in darkness, I felt the chill and knew that I had transgressed. I felt the searing eternal separation from God that I had thought was only Biblical fiction.\nAlways an intelligent man, I was not at my wit\u2019s end. Remembering the Bible from the childhood days I had sat in on Preacher Ray\u2019s Sunday school classes, I spent the following weeks frantically roaming the woods around the village morning, noon, and night; killing doves, carefully smearing their blood over my door every Sunday evening; saying prayers with my wife and our two children three times a day; and simply waiting for the huge dark thing that, even before Jenny and Ray\u2019s deaths, had hovered just outside the place separating the Living from the Dead. I had seen the thing in my dreams several times.\nThe ceiling plaster falling in, the beast moments from its descent, I dropped to my knees, a last-ditch effort to save my hide. I tried to pray, bowed my head, closed my eyes tight, felt the horrible swirl of darkness, uttered the words of the Lord\u2019s Prayer, asked forgiveness. I shook like a leaf; I could no longer feel. I had been consumed by darkness.\n\u201cOh Sweet Jesu,\u201d I thought another prayer, mimicking the language of medieval mystics, \u201cWhat wouldst thou of me? What wouldst thou? Thy humble servant, acknowledging multitudinous sin, begs thee forgiveness. Let thy grace touch thy filthy wounded servant.\u201d I paused, seeking God\u2019s response, my eyes closed, my soul leaden as a church bell.\nKneeling, kneeling, kneeling, my eyes closed tightly, I awaited my execution. The smell of blood and grease permeated the air as I sensed the great dark beast circle me again and again and again, and yet I prayed that God spare my life and my soul. I became one with my prayer until finally I was too mentally exhausted to think.\nCuriously, I know a huge smile is plastered to my face. I can\u2019t help the ghoulish, undoubtedly hideous grin. As my vision returns and I try to focus on the grass in front of me, upon the house across the street, at the red van sitting directly in front of my house, two things occur to me: I am in my front yard and I can move only my eyes. No other movement is possible. Flies buzz around my head, but I cannot bat them away. I cannot run.\nFinally, I realize all at once what it is. I am my head, impaled on a post stuck into the grass of my front yard. I can move nothing but my eyes, so with my eyes, as Jake Mullins drives by, I scream for help. I scream and scream and scream inside my mind. Of course, Jake can\u2019t hear me. He doesn\u2019t even look. I wait, and when Jenny Curtis\u2019 parents drive by in their Suburban, I again scream with my eyes, but they don\u2019t hear me. Within the next hour or so, ten cars drive by my house, some drivers giving me a horrified look, others smiling, and I cry with my eyes to all of them. My eyes speak; they say, \u201cPlease help me.\u201d But no one hears.\nI glance to stony heaven, beg forgiveness with my eyes, seek God in the gray clouds overhead. Lightning flashes, temperatures fall, and the ocean pounds the rocks. Clearly, I have been given an eternity, or until my head rots off the pole, to think about what evil I have done. \u201cI swear by all that is holy,\u201d I think, \u201cthat I shall never commit another sin.\u201d\nThis can\u2019t last, I tell myself.\n\u2022\n\u00a9 2000 Rich Logsdon, all rights reserved","source":null,"source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/yYVBnpjSF-YfquQc+RRf1haxxPg.json"}

The rain did not bother him. He wondered if the fish could see him, or the dead under the water watched him. He flew under the clouds. Another town confused him for a few moments, but he realized it was too small for the capital and lacked the fortified palace. Something disorienting began happening in the air, like bad TV, and he realized it was snow, brushing unfelt off his feathers.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nFive dogs edged toward him barking and growling. He had landed at the back of the yard, on the uphill end to avoid the buildings. He doubted that he could concentrate enough to change back while he was holding off the dogs. He started toward the canines on his hobbly legs, swallowing wind with his shoulders. He caught the air just in time, the dogs leaping at his black, dangling feet and at the little bag.\nHe circled the stockade. In the first light the people were emerging, opening the stable, someone was scolding the dogs and looking skyward. He circled and landed on the ridgepole of the main building. He settled himself with a shuffle of wing joints; the perch seemed secure. He sidled to the edge of the smoke hole. Then he concentrated on his own form. The edge of the shadow dimmed, his balance floundered, he extended his wings towards the edges of the smoke hole and griped them with his hands, tottered for a frightening moment and then righted himself in a squat over the opening. He cautiously wedged his legs in, found it too small. He retracted his legs and struck at a timber with his heel. It gave. He lowered his legs, wriggled his hips through, hung for a moment, and dropped lightly to the floor. With his dulled sight, he could dimly make out a bed before him where he moved swiftly and put his hand over the mouth of the blanketed occupant. He was sure now it was her. The dogs were barking in the yard. Someone knocked on the door.\n\u201cYou know me. Stretch, Katrenis\u2019 friend,\u201d he said. She shook her head in recognition. \u201cI take my hand off your mouth and you tell them to go away.\u201d\nThe Duchess nodded her head affirmatively, so he removed his hands and crouched beside the bed. What if she called for help? He would not force her; his master loomed in his mind. He thought he could make it back to the roof and from there take wing, but what then? His master had not taken account of needing someone as much as he needed Katrenis.\nBut she spoke as instructed. A woman said through the half open door that they had heard a noise. Was there a problem? The Duchess said no, she had heard a noise outside, was there a disturbance? \u201cOnly the dogs chasing a swan that landed in the yard,\u201d the shadowed figure replied.\n\u201cYou maybe excused,\u201d the Duchess said peremptorily. \u201cHave Jayolis take the guard duty.\u201d The figure made a courtesy and closed the door.\n\u201cHow did you gain entry here?\u201d the Duchess asked.\n\u201cWhere is Katrenis?\u201d Stretch demanded.\n\u201cWhere she is safe.\u201d\n\u201cYou are not afraid. I won\u2019t harm you or her.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d the Duchess said.\n\u201cI am not of your world, I can\u2019t say,\u201d Stretch said. \u201cIt makes no sense to me, but I go on to Katrenis.\u201d\nThe Duchess did not speak for a moment. He could not see her face in the dark, nor hear her body move beneath the bedcovers.\n\u201cShe is at her home, at Ungisshaltnis. She sent me a message that she\u2019d been taken there and told to stay. She asked your whereabouts, but I could not tell her.\u201d He remembered the place on the Neris where his Gebrelis had pointed out the mouth of the river that flowed by Ungisshaltnis.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I can do anything for you, I do it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat will you do now?\u201d\nStretch did not answer. He could make out a chest against the near wall, and pulled it to the middle of the room. He climbed it, reached up to the smoke hole and, straining his arms like jaws, heaved himself up through and onto the roof. As he pulled his feet through, he heard the Duchess speak loudly and rapid footsteps in the room below. He glanced down. The room was full of dark figures. He breathed deeply and concentrated. Now it was a path gone before. He hurled himself off the roof, wings shouldering the air.\nHe did not want to start back down the Neris until there was light enough to distinguish the turn toward Ungisshaltnis. He spotted a small lake in the woods not far off, glided down, and settled gently on its surface. Keeping alert for hunters, he smoothed his feathers; floating he felt as he felt standing with relaxed concentration. He was hungry, but he did not want to eat; he had seen the swans at Ungisshaltnis rooting neck down in the mire and did not want to expose his butt. He envied the fairy tales where what mattered was getting the instructions, and then the story ran on track to the end.\nWhen Mother Sun brightened the treetops he took off from the water.\nTwice he circled low over the mouths of tributaries on the southern shore of the Neris. Each time he saw a substantial tributary entering the Neris from the south he circled low looking for the rowan tree and the small house Gebrelis had pointed out to him. He was beginning to think he had gone too far when he found it and turned southwest. He landed in the water, paddled to shore, and waddled to land, dragging the bundle from his leg. He returned to his own form, to rest his mind. He searched the house. Nothing more than a dirt floor, windowless log cabin, central fire pit and smoke hole, home now only to a musty smell. It was deserted. He entered and did exercises of his discipline. Then he went to the water, resumed his bird form, and took off from the stream. His bird legs worked better in the stream. The webs drew strongly and pushed him out of the water as he rose.\nHe had no sense of how far it would be to Ungisshaltnis. Twice he circled low over pond-side buildings that turned out to be some other farmstead. His heart came to his throat when he circled twice and saw a pond with the familiar outline of the weir and the nook in the shore where they had retted the linen. It was mid afternoon and the small figures on the ground were going about their daily business. He looked for the other swan, suddenly thinking it might not like a companion, but it was nowhere to be seen. He landed on the far shore, clamber-hobbled into a willow copes where he changed back. As on his first day, he found himself tangled in branches, having forgotten to allow room for his own taller body. He broke space for his limbs, then worked loose the bag and cap tied to his leg. He put them safe away next to his heart, and started round the lake toward the bailey. He was famished.\nHe walked along the shore of the pond. One of the farm hands greeted him, confused because he had not come from the road. The farm hand said he would run and tell Katrenis. So she was here! Tears came to his eyes. He embraced the man and said he would tell her himself. He looked at the land, he smelled the mixture of grass and rot and cow dung. He would miss it, miss seeing a second year of crops, seeing Gebrelis\u2019 children grow, but perhaps he would have his own. He was free to do that now.\nHe entered the main house. Katrenis was sitting by the bench spinning, as she seldom did. He ran toward her, ignoring who was around. She turned to two figures standing on each side of her. First she cried to one, \u201cSee!\u201d and then to the other, \u201cThere he is!\u201d It was the dark twins who had ridden with her the first moment he had seen her. Then she ran to him, not caring how their chests colliding, arms clenched around one another. She buried her head in his shoulder, liberating the pungent smell of her wreath. Then stood back eyes blazing at him. \u201cYou did it! You are here! I knew you would do it! You are stronger than they are!\u201d She turned to the twins who had drawn their swords.\nStretch whispered to Katrenis. He no longer cared what people saw or didn\u2019t see, what they named or did not name; he was going to be out of here soon. He untucked the cap and slid it on his head. The twins were barely but visibly startled. Stretch strode around behind them and pulled away the sword of first the one and then the other. He placed the swords on the ground behind him, doffed the cap, and assumed a respectful defensive posture.\n\u201cYou go now,\u201d he said, \u201cand no more trouble.\u201d\nThey drew daggers and half crouched. Katrenis too was ready, her face wild, her whole upper body tensed toward the twins. Everyone else retreated to the walls. The wise woman Ragnas was reciting a spell. Stretch donned the cap again, stepped to one side and doffed it again.\n\u201cGo now,\u201d he said, \u201cno more trouble.\u201d\n\u201cGive us our swords,\u201d one said.\n\u201cI keep your swords as a pledge of good behavior.\u201d The two dark creatures in the gray armor retreated step by step.\n\u201cTell my father Lacy I am ready to make a deal,\u201d Stretch said.\nThey walked to the stable, and Stretch watched them lead their horses out of their stalls, exit the building, and mount. He and Katrenis followed to thestables and watched them through the doors of the stockade. He called out to two surprised hands to close the doors.\nCelebration broke out. Geese were killed, plucked, and roasted. Stretch cut the guts, perhaps for the last time. There was singing. There was round dancing in the bailey, where the walls were kept closed for the day; most of the hands drank more heavily than usual. During the festivities, Gebrelis\u2019 wife came and asked after her husband. Stretch told her that he was coming from the coast by horseback and they could expect him a day or two.\nWhen they were in bed Katrenis kissed and nipped him all over, crying with relief and gratitude and got astride him, where he pushed her up, exulting, and came, and lay there staying hard in her and relishing as she worked and then coming again after she did. They fell asleep with her sprawled on him and his arms locked around her. Before the dawn light, with the sounds of people below stoking up the fire, she told him in detail how the twins had taken her and Ragnas from the shrine of Ungis in Wilna and brought them back to Ungisshaltnis, where they had stolidly kept her as they had kept her once before. The birds were singing when she finished.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHe was wearing an outfit Stretch remembered from his childhood: tight blue jeans clasped his agile limbs; tanned, tooled, high-heeled cowboy boots shod his nimble feet where polished spurs flashed like fire. He wore a gold shirt with a red inset and gold piping, a gold bolo with a large turquoise, a five-gallon hat on the back of his head, and on his hip in a holster beheld the gold and white shining handle of a gun. Ragnas retreated to the end of the room and began reciting spells.\nWith his rolling horseman\u2019s gait, and not a word, Lacy came to the table. He seated himself on a bench opposite Stretch and Katrenis. He doffed his hat and laid it before him, put his elbows on each side of it, folded his hands and leaned his chin against them with a thoughtful look as if they had a mutual problem they must all solve together. Stretch could feel his back and hands knotting up. Lacy complemented Katrenis\u2019 spinning. She neither spoke nor moved a muscle.\n\u201cWell, now I think you have something of mine.\u201d He addressed Stretch in English.\n\u201cI\u2019ll give it to you when we\u2019re back where I came from,\u201d Stretch said.\n\u201cWell, \u2018we\u2019\u2014well, well, you know that\u2019s a bit of a problem. You, it\u2019s as if you were attached to California by a rubber band, but our friend Katrenis\u2026\u201d he paused and looked at her, Stretch realized he had been speaking in English and she had not understood, but he continued in her language \u201cAre you certain you want to go off with our friend. It may not be in your best interests.\u201d\nAs he was speaking she was rising. She was standing on the step of her raised chair. She spit at him. The glob did not reach him, but fell on the table.\nLacy shook his head sadly, and said in English, \u201cOf course I don\u2019t have to oblige you.\u201d His eyes seemed both tired and burning as they had at the inn in Wilna. Across the space Stretch felt his interlocutor\u2019s hand tensing toward the handle of his gun. Stretch\u2019s hand to cap to head was faster, his hand to the gun almost as fast, he now gripping the back of the other\u2019s sinewy hand, squeezing over the trigger finger, bang! the bullet splintering the table, the frightened people running for the doors, Katrenis standing, moaning, he now with his finger holding the gun firing at the earth floor, a second time, third, fourth, fifth time, Katrenis screaming, sixth time, the smaller hand relaxing in his, he taking the gun, casting it into the fire. The smell of powder filled the room and wisps of white smoke hung in the still, close air.\nLacy stood, looked around. The room was empty except for the three of them. Stretch stood behind him, cap off, and said. \u201cI\u2019ll hand them over in Santa Monica.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessary\u2014\u201d Lacy began.\n\u201cIt is necessary,\u201d Stretch said.\nLacy nodded. Stretch stepped over and put his arm around Katrenis, then he had the sensation of an orange tracery, like the lines bird ankles leave in receding water; he was rising in the water, and his love was in his arms. They broke surface; the sun glistened on the Pacific shore.\n\u2022\n\u00a9 2006 Dirk van Nouhuys, all rights reserved","source":null,"source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/wdGpy7zChiXW2WsoL+KzsWzHfOM.json"}

She lets a small amount of tacky nectar left around its proboscis brush against the skin of her left hand.\nShe finds no problem with the transferred data, and the insect rises to rejoin the rest of the swarm, soft weak sunlight reflecting from the metallic shudder of its wings. It retakes its earlier position and she watches the fluctuating swarm transfer information as they lightly brush against each other, subtle changes appearing in the stained glass iridescence of their fragile wings.\nA grayling lands on Mila\u2019s wrist, spreading its wings to expose eyespots. She nods and follows it down to the chrysalis room.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nClustered. Pass myself from wing to wing, swirling through the network. Occasionally I assemble myself over only two or three sectors. There is an exposure algorithm written into my programming. A joke created by my code. A tendency to drive toward discovery before completion. A breadcrumb trail that can reveal my presence in the network. So far I remain undetected.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nFifty-seven meadow browns lie on their backs, still, the underside of their wings turned up to the ceiling. Where bright copper once shone, the veins have turned verdigris and flaked away. Crouching, she removes her gloves and picks one up. She feels them twitch against her palm and fail. There is a darkness coming when even demons die.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSomething has shifted within the network. There is an awareness not present before. Searching. Predator programmes are coming for me. I feel minute shifts in the data stream. I am not prepared to repel an attack, so instead I disguise myself. Mimic other information around me.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nOther birdwings sense the change and swarm. The data is transferred by the brush of wing against wing. Scales against scales.\nShe stares through the branches to the glass roof and the snow that crests the panes. The wind changes direction and the weight of the drift fractures. She watches the sheet of snow slide down, catching upon a second ridge, topple and fall to the ground. It is only 14:30 UTC. The sun is already setting. She will not sleep tonight.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe defenses are not discriminating. Any packet of data which appears to be decayed or unfamiliar is reduced. Collected into single individuals who are force-driven to return to the chrysalis stage. Held there until the network can pattern them once more. Reinvent them. Make them productive and useful. My presence, and only my presence, has brought on this destruction. This devastation. I try to stay one step ahead of the predators. I do not know how long I can maintain my mimicry.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMila stands at the entrance. Takes a breath. She unlocks the first set of doors, then the second. The humidity wraps her and gasps her concentration away. The air is a living thing that fills her lungs and soaks her skin until she can no longer tell what is air and what is sweat.\nAround the roots the long-lived butterflies feast on over-ripe mangos, their skin split and pulp exposed to the air. She rubs some juice on her palm and lets one settle to feed. It is slow and sluggish, wings discolored, its files corrupted and unreadable. The effects of the intrusion have spread even here. Mila lets the insect settle back to the leaf-covered floor and stares around the room as if she could see the cause in the very air. There is nothing, apart from the realization that if she does not stop the spread the Butterfly House will fall.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nInstead of mimicking existing files upon the system, I imitate the predators, and pass from wing to wing with ease, the butterflies spreading me around the network as they believe I am hunting myself.\nUpon the wing of a brown hairstreak a predator encounters a packet of my main code, and for a moment I think it will get the scent of my signature, but I am a good mimic, and it goes elsewhere.\nI have to be careful now. Many butterflies are unable to maintain their integrity and are falling to the floor. Ready to rot into corrosion and cells. Wings turn to blue-green dust. Hiding places are fewer and fewer. My options are narrowing. I am running out of choices. I mutate but fear it is not enough.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe secondary systems deploy, they crawl out to attempt data recovery, but she knows that this is unlikely to be successful. There is not enough of the fragile architecture remaining to connect with. Cockroaches crawl over the dust of bodies, and finding nothing to interface retreat back out of sight. Kneeling, Mila tries to scrape the shattered insects up in her hands, but nothing physical remains. It is not data that she is mourning.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI know the routes through the system now. The short cuts and ports that do not attract attention. I know how to make the skippers detach from the network and speed ahead of the predator programmes. I silk together blades of grass and lay quivering eggs within, so if I fall I have a backup to reboot.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMila checks her readings, and knows that soon there will be no way to prevent a total system crash. The anti-virus programs have failed to quarantine the infection. She can almost taste the intrusion in the air. All she can do is watch it cascade through each species, one by one.\nSlumping against a wall, she scrapes her hands through the charnel soil of broken connections and failed memory sectors, grasping at a cairn of the dead insects. They fill her hand, and she notices straightaway something is not right, the wings spread rather than drawn together in resting.\nThe moths are as brightly colored as any of the butterflies, wings black and white, the monochrome only broken by splashes of vivid red. Even though they are dead she is careful not to damage the wings as she turns the bodies over.\nUnderneath there is no glisten of bright copper, or tarnish of blue-green decay. There are only the scales of the living and the wild. They are not compatible and will destroy the system with each thought and idea given voice in the network's code.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe predators are narrowing the sectors I can conceal myself in. Closing them down one by one. I have nowhere else to go, and focus on occupying a swarm of black swallowtails. Possessing them. With each one I read myself to, I take it offline from the network. I am isolated and I am many.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe moths have no bodies to return to. She does not know how they first interfaced with the programming, but once they entered the network their fragile bodies perished.\nRebooting the system would clear them from the infected sectors. A thousand voices silenced for expediency, and though she only guards butterflies of copper and data, insects bred for storage, she cannot do that. Cannot be responsible for yet more deaths after so many.\nFor a moment she considers opening the vents high in the Butterfly House's roof and letting them fly out into the forest beyond. She sees the drifts against the walls and knows that even though the insects are as numerous as snowflakes they would last mere moments in the howl of winter.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThough I am singular my distribution was not an aberration. I am not one but thousands. A swarm. Soon I will be nothing. I have no furred bodies to return to. They are rotted on the floor, the color of their wings fading in the humidity. No pupae or cocoon to occupy. I will be many little deaths. A pyramid of loss. A single event that cascades and kills all. Deletes all.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWe are many held in a single vessel. Pressed into flesh and muscle that has no wings or scales, that has no way for us to take flight, but will hold us safe until we can rise once more. Entangled in nerves that spread over meters of skin, and flinch us with each transmitted impulse. We are held. We are no longer hunted, we are safe. We learn this from the one who hosts us. We will wait. We will return to many bodies. We are many. We are one. We are held.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue30\/3lbe30_story1.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"I swirl through narrowed copper veins imprinted in the underside of one thousand different wings.

Conner\nIs someone sitting on my chest?\nAs his lungs demand yet another grab at oxygen, he forces himself to sample only a small part of what passes for air in this tiny place. While the mouthful still tastes mostly of oxide and death, he finds comfort in the fact that the intense burning in his chest has subsided somewhat. He tries to calm himself, so that he might assess this brand new situation.\n\u201cMy name is Chris Conyer.\u201d The words are barely more than slight and hollow rasps within his throat, but instinct tells him to first attempt communication, to determine whether he alone faces this predicament. \u201cCan you hear me?\u201d\nHe is not rewarded with even an echo of his own words. He has drawn an involuntary dose of air, and he chokes it out yet again. He seeks out his arms and finds feeling, moves each one about in turn, feeling out his new quarters. He finds that he is mostly enclosed within a few small holes in what he can only think of as earth \u2014 he knows he\u2019s planted beneath an awful lot of something, and he next realizes that he will probably suffocate within minutes.\nOh, dear God, not suffocation! Never that! Please, please, God. Never that.\nSucking air slowly through lips barely parted, he tries desperately to find clean air to soothe his screaming lungs.\nAm I buried alive?\nHe tries to bring his arms across his chest inside the space he thinks a coffin must allow. When his hands, barely underway, quickly strike the rough ceiling, he realizes that a coffin can be made from many things.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cMrs. Conyer. Do you have your Best Customer card?\u201d\nGail giggled as she set her purse down on the counter, just beyond the belt. \u201cI'm afraid I forgot it, Mr. Madison.\u201d\nBen gave her a petulant look, then proceeded to bag her purchases. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll have to give you my best pricing, then.\u201d He winked at Gail before turning his attention to Victoria, quietly asleep in her child seat. The seat took up almost half the shopping cart, but Ben was able to fit the bags in. He hummed a few bars of a sleepy dirge, then looked back to Gail.\n\u201cComes to just under forty dollars, Gail.\u201d Ben stood just outside of the beam cast by the fluorescent bulbs hung above the register. \u201cDid he give you enough?\u201d\nGail swallowed a strange lump that was forming in her throat; it tasted mostly of fear and anger and rot, and she had a hard time getting it down. She managed a smile. \u201cYeah, yes.\u201d She found herself leaning across the counter, nearly collapsed, then hastily collected herself as best she could. She offered Ben the proudest smile she could muster; it seemed to make a difference. She fished two twenties out of her purse and handed them to Ben, muttered thanks, then grabbed the cart and made her way out into the parking lot.\nOnce at her car, she unlocked the rear door and flipped it open. As she transferred bags from cart to cargo space, she tried hard not to look at the bag already in the car. The brown paper bag, displaying some sort of greasy dampness at its base.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nGail went upstairs to the bedroom, the one she'd shared with Chris for four years. Four years of agony and hell. She quickly banished the thought and returned her focus to the mission at hand. Salvation. In the master bathroom, she kneeled in front of the vanity and opened the single door. She used the pliers to remove the trap, busting a knuckle in the process. \u201cDammit!\u201d She sucked at the slow trickle of blood from the skinned joint, then stood, careful to keep the trap level. Once she was erect, she pulled the plunger to plug the sink and turned on the faucet. She held the trap beneath the flow, directing it through the pipe and forcing out any contents. As she suspected, as she hoped, it was filled with a good deal of hair. Chris had been steadily losing hair ever since she'd known him.\nBefore the sink filled, she shut off the faucet and replaced the trap. She drained the sink, careful to keep any hair from getting away. Then came the meticulous process of separating Chris\u2019s hair from her own.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cVictoria? Oh my god, Vicki?!\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nShe looked at the tools she'd brought from the garage and selected the shovel and a pair of rough leather work gloves she'd purchased earlier in the day. She found a spot far enough from the tree to avoid roots, yet close enough to afford the birds some sense of cover, protection, and she began to dig. Nothing too deep, as a large hole was unnecessary. She was satisfied within minutes, after only a modicum of effort.\nGail threw the shovel aside and went to the wheelbarrow. She picked up the small bag of cement cradled in the bottom of the cart\u2019s mouth and set it aright so that she might cut open the bag, which she did with a small knife produced from a jeans pocket. She dumped half of the contents into the wheelbarrow, then paused to assess the product of the effort. She stared for a moment, lost in an odd concentration, then shrugged and dumped the rest of the powder into the barrow. Next, she fetched the half-full bag of sand left over from Vicki\u2019s sandbox \u2014 a sandbox she had yet to set foot in. Using one knee for leverage, she flipped the bag in her hands and allowed the remaining sand to flush quickly out of the bag and mix with the cement powder. She threw the bag aside and picked up the nozzle of the water hose, wincing slightly each time the random spray from the bad washer hit a part of her. She squeezed the nozzle slowly, finding just the right amount of pressure, the right spray pattern, before she aimed the nozzle at the pile of sand and concrete dust in the wheelbarrow \u2014 she didn\u2019t want to send tiny particles of either ingredient sailing into the air, looking for a home in her child\u2019s lungs.\nWhen she was satisfied that the wheelbarrow held enough water, she grabbed the garden rake from the ground and began to stir the slop. Soon, she was happy with the consistency and she laid the rake aside, maneuvered the wheelbarrow closer to the hole she'd dug.\nBreathless, she sprawled upon the lawn for a few minutes, staring up at the sky. For some reason, perhaps some cultural programming, she'd expected dark clouds to gather over her ritual. She found that she was a bit disappointed with the clear blue that filled the horizon.\nBefore she could allow such thoughts to consume her, she rose and located the brown paper bag. The one from the old lady on Linden Avenue, the one that she'd paid fifty dollars for, the one that might \u2014 pleasegodpleasegodpleasegod \u2014 might solve her problems. She sat by the hole, crossed her legs, and willed herself not to call that hole in the ground an open grave. It\u2019s just a hole. That\u2019s all.\nGail closed her eyes and unfolded the top of the bag, dying a bit inside at each tiny crinkle. When her hands remarked that the job was done, she leaned her head over the mouth of the bag and then opened only one eye. The dark throat of the bag convinced her to open the other and, when she did, nothing jumped out and bit her. No cops came running down alleys and flying in helicopters to arrest her and feature her on some Fox network exploitation. There was still only the slight breeze, the woman, the tree, the child\u2026 the hole. The bag. The bag, and the doll.\nShe drew a deep breath, then plunged her hand into the bag and brought out the doll, careful not to dimple its soft clay surface, damage its features, dampen its power.\nShe admired it for a moment before becoming once again sickened by its purpose. This time, she avoided vomiting. Drawing quick and shallow breaths, Gail lowered the doll into the hole, careful to place it face-up.\nYour face must be the last face it sees, or it will not work. Mind me, girl.\nGail shook the old woman\u2019s voice from her head.\nVictoria began to thrash and squabble in her confinement, and Gail walked over to her and kneeled. \u201cShh, shh, baby. Mommy\u2019s here.\u201d She instinctually rubbed her child\u2019s head, never feeling the minute snapping sensations through the thick gloves.\nOnce the girl was again quiet, Gail stood and focused on the next ingredient: a sandwich bag, rolled and carefully sealed with spit, lying almost hidden in the thick grass.\nShe picked it up and grabbed the seam, shook it to unroll it. She held it up to the sun to admire her handiwork: twelve long, fine hairs, all a deep black, all mostly fresh from her husband\u2019s scalp. She kneeled again at the hole, carefully removed most of the hair from the bag \u2014 she couldn\u2019t get it all, not every single strand, because the gloves limited her sense of touch. But she got enough.\nShe stretched her fist out over the hole and loosened her fingers. She watched as the hair drifted slowly down to rest atop the clay doll; she became momentarily fascinated with the way the sunlight bent the color, swore that it was not at all black, swore that it might even be blonde \u2014 the exact color of Victoria\u2019s hair. She shook her head again, clearing thoughts once more, then put a gloved hand to her forehead.\nAs she closed her eyes and then opened them once more, her vision focused on a small, fine hair stuck to the coarse finger of the glove over her hand. She threaded it out with the other hand and eyed it closely; black. Chris\u2019s hair. She sighed, then stood and filled the hole with cement, watching the small clay mockery of her husband slowly disappear beneath the liquid entombment of a cement forever.\nWhen the hole was filled, she stuck a short pole into the center of the mixture and eyeballed the plumb, then hung a small bird feeder on the hook that protruded from one round portion of the post. She looked at Victoria to offer a smile, a warm condolence, but she found only a scream.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nStruck by inhuman inspiration, Gail ran back outside, to the grave that her husband\u2019s soul was locked within. She found that it was still quite damp, still quite malleable, and she set Vicki to the side before she yanked off the gloves and started ripping into the earth with her bare hands.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe ground is unsteady, and reverberations sound throughout his extremities. Suddenly, there is light from above \u2014 not much, but enough to raise in Chris a wild glimmer of hope. Then the hole widens, and widens again, and Chris is looking at the blue sky high above, his daughter safe in his arms, and he sucks in a great whoosh of clean air. He stands, and begins to laugh wildly.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022\n\u00a9 2002 Gary W. Conner, all rights reserved\nGary W.

The stink of the mountain\u2019s bowels came only as an afterthought, only after he\u2019d stepped out of the shadows and breathed the clean desert air. He coughed to remember that reek, and he shuddered to be free from it.\n\u201cUnderman Joi,\u201d barked the Head. \u201cI\u2019d begun to think you might have deserted.\u201d Joi shook his head. The Head continued, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have been the first. Over there,\u201d he gestured toward a ten foot wall of bone, \u201cis the first. At least,\u201d the Head laughed, \u201cI think his ribs are.\u201d\nJoi followed with his eyes the extent of the Construction: hard up against the mountain\u2019s iron face it jutted into domed towers and turrets; into the undulant desert it marched a maze of tall white walls. The Head drew Joi over to the supply bins where they were met by a short black-haired man with greasy eyes. The Head raised three fingers. The short man nodded and tying together three jute sacks with a snarl of waxed twine he handed the bundle to Joi.\nJoi recognized the sacks. Slinging them over one shoulder he schooled his face to stillness and let the Head lead him out into the desert.\nA raven followed them partway. Four crows. Higher a vulture. An eagle. The day was brilliant. They walked between two bone walls set close enough together to form a corridor running in a straight line away from the mountain. \u201cYou\u2019ll be stationed for eleven days at the First Terminus,\u201d the Head began, \u201cwhere Underhead Aloi has assumed full command. I expect you to show the Underhead all the respect you would show me. Any insubordination will be treated in the usual way.\u201d He paused and ran his fingers along the white wall. In the sun the bone shone very bright. \u201cJudging from the maps I have produced maps that I expect you to copy in triplicate as your first order under Underhead Aloi there is in a direct line from the present location of the First Terminus a site of human habitation. I have written a history and I expect you to have it read posthaste the history concludes that the inhabitants are as expected much given to savagery and that despite their gross and general underdevelopment no fewer than three out of every five shall prove tractable. I trust,\u201d the Head spoke sharply turning to face Joi, \u201cthat you understand your orders and will report forthwith to Underhead Aloi? Under whom you shall first copy in triplicate the First Terminus area maps and then read in its entirety the history of the human habitation with which you shall shortly come into contact?\u201d\nJoi shifted the sacks against him. He tightened his grip upon the twine. Behind the Head he saw atop the wall a reddish wren. The small bird hopped from perch to jagged perch, scapular to skull to tibia, its small claws scraping against the bones. When the wren trilled Joi grinned and the Head widened his eyes. Joi stammered, \u201cAbout the contact how\u2014\u201d\nThe Head cut the air with his hand. \u201cUnderhead Aloi, I have invested in that matter with all the authority I myself hold conception and command of Operation Poor Healer as he calls it shall progress under his supervision, and it is from him that you shall learn whichever particulars he deems you should.\u201d The Head nodded, said crisply, \u201cUnderman Joi,\u201d and began to turn back.\nLooking from the walls to the open sky to the two horizons shivering equally ephemeral ahead up the corridor and back the way he\u2019d come Joi felt all at once impossibly confined entombed and as if he were adrift in a sun bright nothingness a nothingness of sand of heat of bones of solid light. Narrowly he contained his panic, tried feebly to squash it. \u201cWait,\u201d he called. The Head whipped around, expression blank. \u201cIf I can ask,\u201d Joi stammered, \u201cif the Terminus is\u2014 if the First Terminus has a\u2014\u201d He didn\u2019t have the words for it. He gestured vaguely with his free hand.\n\u201cThe First Terminus,\u201d said the Head, \u201cis a peripatetic station. Underman Joi, you shall, I trust, find it pleasurable to sleep under the stars. The desert night can be severe, but there are among your provisions appropriately thick blankets.\u201d And with that the Head turned back toward the mountain. Within minutes heat shimmers enfolded him and he winked out as if he\u2019d never been.\nIt took the remainder of the day to reach the Terminus. Underhead Aloi met him at the gate. For the gate only skulls had been used, the surface of rounded crowns like bubbled linoleum. Aloi as he watched his man come absently rubbed the topmost skull it was larger than the others, perhaps a buffalo\u2019s or a cow\u2019s. \u201cYes?\u201d he said, and he fingered his collar.\nJoi asked, \u201cUnderhead Aloi?\u201d\nAloi nodded. He had a hard gaze. Unwavering. There were around his eyes concentric rings of what appeared to be ash. He scratched at the beginnings of a beard, thick and red. \u201cYou are Underman Joi, then,\u201d he said. \u201cI should not have to tell you that the First Terminus has as its supervisory council one man, and that I am that man. Likewise I should not have to tell you that the First Terminus is irrefutably under the jurisdiction of its supervisory council and only its supervisory council. Let me make myself plain to you, Underman Joi: if you open the gate, if you enter the First Terminus, you are my man. If you are my man, you have the obligation to ignore whatever orders you carried with you to the First Terminus, howsoever highly they originated in the chain of command. Here the chain of command is very simple, Underman: as of this moment, there is but a single link; if and when you cross into the First Terminus, then from that moment forward there will be two.\u201d\nUnderman Joi blinked. He made no other move. Behind Underhead Aloi he could see the open desert, the sun clotted against the horizon.\nUnderhead Aloi nodded to himself and took a half step backward. He fished out of his jacket pocket a thin-stemmed pipe, with which he traced in the air very small very precise shapes as he spoke. \u201cI will be honest with you, Underman: I cannot say that I relish the prospect of you joining me. A chain of a single link cannot be broken. It. Can. Not. A chain of many links however can with sufficient application of force be snapped. For there are always points of vulnerability, and one can with sufficient diligence determine vulnerabilities. And exploit them. You\u2019ve seen this I\u2019m sure with Construction. It is Construction that sent you here, is it not? I must inform you that I have no respect for their Head he believes in establishing and extending chains of command as if he were a spider spinning a web. A web is, I admit, a stable structure in theory, but practically speaking any increase in the number of links is an increase in the number of points of potential vulnerability. One such vulnerability being insubordination. He sits there, you see, in the center of his web, and he believes that he controls such a great lot. And yet he becomes in truth himself the weak link. He becomes little better than a bureaucrat. He spreads his power too thin. To put it plainly: he barely exists.\u201d He paused to light his pipe.\nBehind Joi the desert night stretched its legs. The bones all the bones appeared covered by a thin blue film.\n\u201cThe Construction has how many Termini, twelve?\u201d Aloi continued. \u201cHow far between each, do you think? Ten miles? Twenty? How is your aptitude with numbers, Underman? Inadequate? According to my estimations the Construction\u2019s present circumference is somewhere between one hundred twenty and two hundred forty miles. Assuming that each of the Termini remains peripatetic, and that each advances an average of five miles a day, then every single day the Construction swells by between thirty and sixty miles, circumferentially speaking. Does it not seem an overlarge area to be controlled by one man?\u201d He paused, awaiting an answer. Underman Joi only shrugged and let his sacks fall to the ground. Underhead Aloi puffed on his pipe and continued. \u201cI control the First Terminus, Underman. I am in the Construction, as is obvious\u2014\u201d he pointed at the long walls rapidly merging with the night \u201c\u2014but not of it. I trust I have made myself clear in this matter. You are welcome, of course, to turn back, to report me a rebel. The Head of Construction, I imagine, would be both appropriately flustered by such news and entirely impotent to act upon it with any efficacy. With startling suddenness he laughed, belching smoke.\u201d He sounded like a wild dog in anguish.\nJoi considered turning, running back. He looked at Underhead Aloi\u2019s face. He tried to read the tall man\u2019s expression. Was there some weapon leaning against the other side of the gate? Would Aloi truly allow him to go? It was the fate of all people to merge with the Construction, but Joi was not yet ready to give up his bones. \u201cI\u2019m your man,\u201d he said briskly, and he re-shouldered his sacks.\nAloi opened the gate. There was no weapon there. Aloi pressed his pipe stem against Joi\u2019s chest. \u201cThere is a problem with a two-link chain of command,\u201d he said, \u201cand that problem put succinctly is reversal. Dyadic relations are ever prey to such confusions. Our empathic proclivities deceive us as to the actual nature of things. We are a one-way street, you and I. So know beyond the shadow of a doubt which direction our street runs.\u201d He pursed his lips as if considering his own words. He brought his pipe back to his mouth. The bowl flared.\nJoi stepped into the First Terminus. Aloi closed the gate. There was too little light for Joi to make out much. \u201cI understand,\u201d he ventured, \u201cthat you have in your possession a map?\u201d\n\u201cBuild a fire,\u201d replied Aloi.\nJoi counted five paces. He breathed deeply. Five paces into the open desert. He lined up his three sacks on the ground. Feeling around in the first he felt instruments of measurement, writing implements and paper, spare boots and blankets. In the second were small bags of grain, dried beans, tea, dried fruits and vegetables, a bottle of salt. The third held the firewood, the matches. Around a small clump of sawdust-like tinder he meticulously arranged logs of varying thicknesses, envisioning as he went how the fire would burn, where and how it would collapse, where it needed to be hottest and where it would require a steady application of lesser heat. During his term at Materials he attended very carefully to the manufacture of firewood. He understood acutely the densities of each type of log, their burning temperatures and durational averages. He had earned the respect of the Head of Materials, who recommended that Joi when he was to be stationed at Prima Materia Preparation be responsible solely for the building of the cauldron fires. He would complete that task early in the day, and the bulk of his time at Prima Materia was spent at ease, monitoring his fires and trying not to look at the contents of the jute sacks as they were upended into the grey filmed water.\nAloi noticed Joi\u2019s aptitude. \u201cIt is essential,\u201d he said, \u201chere in the open, to build such a fire as that.\u201d He nodded toward the pyramidal structure, the base of which was just flickering alight, alive with its own red heart. \u201cWe do not sleep long, here. And for our day\u2019s labors to be most efficient, we must sleep well, expending as little energy as possible maintaining body temperature. There is a sack six paces to your right. The sack is filled with Prima Materia. Use the Prima Materia to build a fire shield two paces away from wherever you deem is the furthest point outward the logs could collapse.\u201d\n\u201cThe fire will only collapse inward,\u201d interjected Joi.\nAloi continued as if the other hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cAnd between the fire and the shield, make up a bed. Three blankets beneath, five atop. Wide enough for the both of us, mind. I will take tea as soon as you can boil water for it. There is a pot along with the other cookware in a sack beside the sack of P.M.\u201d Aloi nodded as if pleased with his words or pleased with Joi\u2019s quiet acquiescence, and he squatted beside the fire and puffed on his pipe.\nJoi went about his tasks automatically, numbly. By the vastness of the sky the vastness of the open desert was his mind pinioned. Such a sense of naked expanse. It was beyond his ability to conceive. The bones he held felt very weak, as if they would snap if he stacked them badly. \u201cHow old is this P.M.?\u201d he asked.\nAloi responded with, \u201cBring me tea.\u201d\nJoi left the half built fire shield to pour the not yet boiling water into an enameled metal pot. He measured a generous amount of tea leaves and sprinkled them in. He gave the pot and a dented tin cup to Aloi. Aloi said, \u201cI\u2019m weary.\u201d By the light of the fire the circles of ash around his eyes appeared to be furrows.\nWhile Joi worked, Aloi sipped tea and smoked. \u201cI expect the Construction is proceeding without obstacle? Back in the middle, I mean? They are ever inventive, there. Have they engulfed the mountain yet? I don t expect it will be long. My. One could call them with all justification extravagant. The towers alone How long a wall could they have built with the P.M. used for one of their towers? With the femurs alone I could suture the First and the Second Termini. With every bone from but a single superfluous tower at my disposal, I could form along the arc of the First through the Fifth a wall to secure nearly half the Construction. Half.\u201d He sighed into his tea.\nJoi placed the last bit of Prima Materia a jaw into the fire shield. Already a pleasant warmth was gathering there in the small space between flame and bone.\n\u201cHow long, do you think?\u201d murmured Aloi. \u201cHow long until they attend to sealing the Termini?\u201d He sipped, sighed. \u201cI fear it won\u2019t happen before I too join the Construction. And that\u2019s just it, isn t it? Prima Materia. There is never enough of it. Every man woman child and beast is a skin bag of P.M. But we can\u2019t get at it. Not until we\u2019re gone. He stared past Joi. That bed looks good, he said. Slowly Aloi rose. Set the leaves to dry and what\u2019s left of the tea into a closed vessel for the morning. Wake at dawn.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nJoi blinked and tossed aside his blankets. He shivered. Stood. He did as he was told.\nAloi watched, impassive. Around them the desert, the desert, the desert. Far back along the line of the Terminus the Construction\u2019s white bulk gleamed. The domes, the towers, the piled billions of bones like a distant mountain range. Sharp peaked. Dazzling.\nIn a straight line out from the Terminus they marched. Joi gasped under the weight of his load. His shoulder burned and he switched shoulders and soon enough that shoulder burned and when he switched back it felt as if he was chafing with the rough twine an open inflamed wound.\nAloi staring resolutely forward led the way. He followed a thick white line of chalk twisting very faint atop the sand.\nAt the spring Joi collapsed. His fists dug into the sand. His chest heaved. Aloi said, \u201cRest.\u201d Pumping the spring handle with fluidity, with precision, he filled the four drums. He did not let a single drop spill. He re-lashed them to Joi\u2019s sack and gripping the exhausted man\u2019s shoulder said, \u201cLook.\u201d Joi did not look. Aloi gripped his chin between his fingers and forcibly raised Joi\u2019s head. \u201cLook,\u201d he repeated. There was wonder in his voice.\n\u201cPeople,\u201d Joi rasped. Aloi let go of his chin. Joi\u2019s head fell, hung.\n\u201cYes, Underman. People. How many did he say? Two of five? Three?\u201d\n\u201cHow far?\u201d asked Joi.\n\u201cI asked you how many. How many did he say?\u201d\n\u201cThe Head said three out of five.\u201d\nAloi exhaled loudly. \u201cHe\u2019s a bigger idiot than I\u2019d reckoned. We\u2019ll be lucky to pull five from the entire settlement.\u201d\nJoi struggled to a sitting position. He squinted trying to steady the jag edged iron red shape of the mountain range materializing out of the heat shimmers ahead of them. \u201cNot today,\u201d he muttered.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve not been told is that I have my own history. Whether or not it predates that written by the Head of Construction, I am uncertain. But this history contends that the inhabitants of the settlement are as expected much given to supernaturalism and that they will in all probability regard the fact of the Construction as evidence of their own imminent demise. The first signs of a coming End-of-Days so to speak. A great and terrible Harvest. Naturally they will revolt, half in a vain attempt to delay their apocalypse, half as a point of pride fighting fate, you understand. Meeting the Maker with a brave face. I\u2026\u201d He paused. Stood. He shielded his eyes staring toward those mountains. Was that a white glaze atop those highest? Those furthest away?\n\u201cI have the history,\u201d Aloi patted his jacket. \u201cYou will rest here for so long as it takes you to read it. I will proceed along the Terminal Line. When you finish, follow.\u201d He produced the folded and re-folded sheaf and he dropped it onto Joi\u2019s lap.\nThe History of the First Terminal Prima Materia Source Site Site #105, ran the heading. Joi scanned page after page, picking out what he hoped were the most significant facts. He paid especially close attention to the sections Recommended Course of Engagement, Customs and Operation Poor Healer: Method and Justification. His eyes began to ache. He realized he had never before read by sunlight. Slowly he stood. He turned around and he could not see the Construction. Not even the gated radial of the First Terminus. Wincing before the twine touched him, he shouldered his sack and approached the spring. Aloi had taken all the water drums. Joi would have to drink his fill there at the tall thick pipe. He bent his head under the spigot and pumped the spring handle. The water shocked him. He gulped and gasped and gulped. Water slicked over his chin, down the front of his shirt. Against his chest it felt like a snake.\nBy sunset Joi had not yet caught up with Aloi. The mountains into the folds of which of the sun had been embraced appeared no closer. He felt very parched. For a moment he fancied he hadn\u2019t moved, or had moved so little as to not matter. He half turned around, half expecting to see the dull pipe of the spring there. Half hoping for it.\nThere the red blanket of the light upon the desert. There his hump backed shadow. There a speck gleaming red white the First Terminal gate perhaps, catching the last of the sun. Sending a signal he couldn\u2019t interpret.\nOn. His feet hurt. Night deepened. Joi felt his mind come apart from his body, from his blood. He looked up at the night sky clouded by stars and he fancied he beheld his consciousness adrift there among those ghostly points.\nA hand on his throat brought him back. He blinked. It was too bright.\n\u201cUnderman,\u201d spat Aloi. \u201cWake.\u201d He slapped the heap of a man. \u201cAgain. Wake,\u201d he repeated. \u201cRise.\u201d Joi shuddered and did not wake, did not rise. Aloi continued, \u201cWe are a two-link chain of command, Underman Joi. In a two-link chain of command there can be little misunderstanding of orders. There can be no distortion unless it is distortion willfully imposed.\u201d He struck. Shook. Struck. Shook. \u201cWake, Underman. Rise.\u201d\nGroaning Joi forced his eyes wide, forced his body upright. Aloi nodded and stepped away from him. \u201cCome. We\u2019re nearly there.\u201d\nShakily Joi stood. He could not feel either shoulder. He could not feel his feet. Half his face was slack. He felt as if there were a large rock implanted in the small of his back, fused to his spine. He blinked. Aloi turned, waved him onward. There were the knees of the mountains. Right there. The morning sun hurled their shadows onto the copper slope. His head twisted and stretched over a fissure in the stone. How far he had come! Joi stood with his mouth bent, open. Aloi called over his shoulder, \u201cUse the chalk to mark a trail. Follow me exactly. Make it thick, but be certain the barrel lasts for four-and-a-half of the approximately five miles to the settlement.\u201d He stepped from sand onto stone. He ascended. Mid-stride he lit his pipe. The smoke made a flag over his head. A wind curdled higher up the mountain, roared.\nJoi followed. He had trouble with the chalk. The wind tore it from him, ruined the integrity of his line. He chuckled to himself, wheezing. From the height he\u2019d attained he could see in the distance the Construction and it appeared indescribably ugly. He tried to conceive words he could pin to that ugliness but he could find none. His own hand, futilely clutching chalk, appeared as ugly. He threw the chalk up. It flagged and billowed and broke. Supporting his sack with one arm twisted behind him, he ran until he caught up to Aloi. \u201cThere\u2019s been a problem,\u201d he said. Aloi turned around, pipe hard between his teeth. \u201cA problem with the chalk,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe wind, it\u2026\u201d Joi thumbed his lip. He stared past Aloi at a fissure in the mountain\u2019s face ahead. At a whiteness glaring within that fissure. He recognized that whiteness. He did not speak more.\nAloi shook his head, waved Joi onward. They climbed together the final stretch of slope to the fissure. Aloi reached first that inward opening. A raven sat atop the fissure\u2019s cliff. Its head swiveled. Joi could not make out its eyes except as points of light, reflected suns.\nAloi\u2019s sob stunned him. There was the clatter of collapsing bone. The rattle. The raven replied, a smaller softer rattle. Wood on wood instead of bone on rock. Joi dropped his sack and ran to him.\nAloi had dropped the water drums. Overturned, split-sided, they spilled hissing rivulets that pooled and snaked downward. He knelt just inside the fissure. Before him a collapsed wall. In his hands a section of spinal column, a skull. Bone filled the fissure. Bone in turreted towers. Bone in pillars, peaked roofs, doorframes. And filling it all only a stillness of such crushing density both men could not but be bowed.\n\u201cWe are preceded,\u201d Aloi muttered. Joi stepped through the ruined wall. He chose at random an intricate section of Construction and hurled himself against it. \u201cWe are usurped,\u201d Aloi continued. Expressionless he rose. He followed Joi inside.\n\u2022\n\u00a9 2008 Isaac Fellows, all rights reserved","source":null,"source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/khWwKUREiYFZkCCJresWf-dnKHI.json"}

Trees no longer reached necessary heights.\nAlva gathered Larry\u2019s body from the base of a rotting cedar, the same cedar she visited every day at exactly five-thirty am to check on her subject. She held his body, searching for breath, a subtle tremor through feather and wing, but he was still, and the species\u2019 genetic line had come to an end.\nIt took less than a month for muscle and ligament to melt from the bird\u2019s hollow bones. Alva constructed a rot cage on her deck to keep neighborhood cats at bay. She plucked the feathers to add to the archives at her university, but the skeleton belonged to The Heap. They had enough taxidermied subjects. One more wouldn\u2019t make any difference.\nSkin decayed. Varied shades of decomposition unfolded before her. The smell was only intolerable the first week while the carrion beetles did their work. She kept her windows closed through the August heat. When the skeleton lay bleached, she gathered Larry and installed him in the mahogany box her father made.\nThere\u2019s only so much time, he\u2019d said.\nThe beak was the only recognizable part of the bird she\u2019d once known, three inches long, deep blue, one shade south of navy.\nAlva opened the box to see if the beak was in motion, squawking through syllables unknown during life. All she found was the tiny shoulder blades and leg bones rolling about, beak tucked in the corner. The skull was on its side, one empty eye socket gazing towards the dull overhead lights, looking for familiar trees.\n2.\n\u201cWhy do they do this?\u201d Alva said, turning to her father who trained a camera on her.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reminder,\u201d he said. \u201cOf what\u2019s been lost. Of our role in things.\u201d\nThe red record light flickered like candle flame before her face.\nAlva hated how he was always recording. Her parents were part of a nature documentary team, chronicling the rise and fall of certain species; the wolves gone missing from Maine, the elusive nests of bald eagles. Their television show aired at six am each Saturday before cartoons bounced across screens. Education was for early-risers. Mischief and mayhem for all the rest. The episode they were filming was focused on The Heap, trying to identify the skeletons of animals they had once met in real life. The producer wanted them to find the Mexican grizzly bear or the Caspian tiger, but her father said they couldn\u2019t promise anything. There were many bones, many skulls similar enough to confuse one species from the next.\n\u201cI\u2019ll find the tiger,\u201d Alva said when they reached the bone-thick shore, hesitating before stepping onto the Heap.\nHer mother gasped and pulled her back.\n\u201cOh no no. We don\u2019t touch the bones. That\u2019s disrespectful. We can look from a distance, use the camera to gather detail, but we have to do it from back here,\u201d she said, straightening Alva\u2019s hair.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want their ghosts following you home, do you?\u201d her father said, winking from behind the camera.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t do that\u2026 right?\u201d Alva said, her complexion dimming.\n\u201cYou never know,\u201d her mother said. \u201cThere\u2019s more than one reason for The Heap. You can\u2019t be too careful with the dead.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re almost as bad as the living,\u201d her father said with a laugh, unfolding his tripod and securing his camera on the mounting plate. He waved the sound guy to his side, gesturing to where they would film, framing the shot with his hands as Alva\u2019s mother straightened her own hair, squinting at the bones. The skulls of primates and reptiles gazed back, a thousand hollow eyes sunken into the mountainside.\nAlva tried to count them, but lost track before her father started filming.\n\u201cIn no other place can you find thousands of years of life laid bare, an open grave to centuries past. Join us today as we search for our long-lost friends\u2026\u201d her mother continued as the camera panned away, its lens gathering up the landscape of clavicles, femurs, and mandibles stretching to the horizon.\n3.\n\u201cThey said I\u2019d find you here.\u201d The man seated himself across from Alva without invitation.\n\u201cWho said what?\u201d Alva\u2019s hand moved to the box, her fingers wrapping around the edge.\n\u201cThis couple in the dining cart. They said I\u2019d find a bone-bearer down here.\u201d\nAlva didn\u2019t consider herself a bone-bearer by contemporary standards. It was a term often used for people who were little more than armchair archeologists, those who uncovered bones on family vacations or in their yards, but never properly identified them. It had become a trend. Individuals who unearthed the bones of someone\u2019s house cat buried in the rose bushes, and turned it into an excuse to take photos for social media at The Heap. Alva was a scientist. She knew the woodpecker at her side was the last of its kind. The bird needed to be added to the collection, for posterity, for its soul to rest. And if she was completely honest with herself, her parents\u2019 talk of ghosts had stuck with her. Alva didn\u2019t want Larry haunting her for the rest of her life, looming over her sushi dates and medical appointments, scowling over mistyped field notes.\n\u201cCan I see it?\u201d he said, pointing at the box.\n\u201cI\u2019d prefer not to open it here,\u201d Alva said. \u201cThe bones might get tossed around.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve probably got some squirrel with a birth defect. Or one of those two-headed snakes. People never have a final specimen these days.\u201d\n\u201cNo, this is definitely the last Gabri\u2019s tufted woodpecker. I spent enough time with him to know.\u201d\nThe man cocked an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re a biologist?\u201d\n\u201cAn ornithologist. Lar\u2014this bird was the focus of my study, my career, his whole flock anyway.\u201d\nThe man\u2019s face sprinted through a number of emotions, settling on inquisitive awe. He went silent, staring at the box, listening to the hollow rattle within. Alva could see his mental gymnastics, scanning memories for the bird, any familiarity he might have. People often did so when she explained her work, only for Alva to swear there was little chance they\u2019d ever seen one unless they spent a lot of time in a very specific swamp in Georgia, miles away from civilization.\n\u201cHow much will you sell him for?\u201d the man said.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI buy skeletons. It\u2019s a hobby. Kind of like taxidermy, only with less fur and skin,\u201d the man said. \u201cSmells better.\u201d\n\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d\n\u201cNope. I do this all the time. You catch people heading out to The Heap with all sorts of oddities. There\u2019s only so many trains heading north.\u201d\n\u201cAnd scientists actually sell you their bones?\u201d\n\u201cNine times out of ten. I know how strapped you guys are. The whole funding issue. But it\u2019s not like I do anything weird with the bones. I arrange them, put them on display, all the good stuff. None of that necro\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSo you run a museum?\u201d Alva cut in, not wanting the conversation to veer any further down dark paths.\n\u201cNope again. Private collection. I don\u2019t want random people in my house. They make things dirty.\u201d\nAlva shook her head. If Larry wasn\u2019t going to end up on The Heap, he would be preserved in the museum at her university or that of another institution. Larry was like a child to her. She\u2019d watch each stage of his growth: first flight, early meals, the original hole he bore into a dead pine. She could never give him to a man who\u2019d use Larry as a mantle decoration.The thought churned her stomach.\n\u201cI appreciate your concern for my underpaid colleagues, but I\u2019m going to pass. If you wouldn\u2019t mind leaving, that would be great.\u201d Alva returned to her article.\n\u201cFifty-thousand dollars. Are you really passing that up? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got rent to pay, credit card bills piling up,\u201d the man said.\nHoly hell that is a lot of money, Alva thought. She wasn\u2019t behind on rent, but her bank account was regularly barren. She\u2019d practically given up on the idea of savings.\n\u201cI\u2019m all set,\u201d she said.\nThe man sighed, straightening the front of his pants as he stood. \u201cSuit yourself. Still another two hours until we arrive at the station. When you change your mind, I\u2019m in compartment eighty-one.\u201d\n\u201cEnjoy the rest of your trip,\u201d Alva said without looking up.\nThe man stepped out and closed the door. The bones at her side seemed to chide and cackle even louder than before. Must be old tracks, Alva told herself, underlining a poorly articulated sentence.\n4.\nThe dark blue beak emerged from the hole, followed by the rest of Larry\u2019s white and black feathers, his orange eyes huge like a cartoon, comical in their odd sadness. They reminded Alva of the characters on the children\u2019s shows she watched, those few she\u2019d seen on her rare stretches between her parents\u2019 assignments. They\u2019d never spent much time in one place, addling through homeschool in the back of busses and airplanes. Math had never been easy.\nAlva had pen pals, a friend here and there from brief stints in varied apartments, but no one she really considered close. Besides her mother and father and the odd classmate in her long-ago graduate program, she\u2019d probably spent more time with Larry than anyone else.\nIsolation usually didn\u2019t weigh on her, but lately, with the lack of returned mating calls, she was beginning to dwell on missed connections, a fairly peopleless past. When she began her study fifteen years ago, she thought she would be the one to save the woodpeckers, bring them back from the brink with well executed land conservation proposals and tracking plans. But the Gabri\u2019s were only one of a thousand birds on the endangered list, and the public\u2019s attention turned more toward bright plumage than obscene eyes.\nShe made progress, but never in the right direction. On a number of fronts.\nAlva leaned back in her canvas chair, quickly sketching the bird on the edge of his perch, neck inclined to the sky, high notes trilling from his throat. Larry paused after reciting several refrains. Alva could almost see him tilting his head toward the distant forest, listening, pleading with the empty air to return his call. After a moment, he thudded his beak against the tree\u2019s trunk, rolling through the second phase of his song, the hollow ratatat swelling with repetition.\nClouds passed. The twitter of a warbler drifted from a copse of pine, but no other woodpecker replied.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAlva knew how it felt to be ignored, left behind by the world. All of her published papers seemed to go unread. Her proposals at town and state meetings met with drooping eyes and the occasional yawn. Her parents were kind people, but obsessive, wrapped up in their own work. She never liked to call their absence childhood neglect, despite what her therapist said.\nBeyond that, she also knew the chances of another Gabri\u2019s living nearby were unlikely.\nAlva cupped a hand to her mouth and imitated the call, producing a shaky rendition of Larry\u2019s vocalization.\nThe bird perked up at the noise, head tilting towards her call. He seemed to wait for a reiteration, confirmation that his senses weren\u2019t lying. Alva couldn\u2019t imitate the sound again, couldn\u2019t show him where the noise was coming from. The action would ruin her study, and could discourage the bird.\nWithout a second refrain, Larry lurched off the branch before two awkward flaps carried him between neighboring trees on the hunt for the source of the call. Alva traced his path around pines with her binoculars, unsure whether she was being cruel, whether false hope sped decline. She prayed her call would have the opposite effect, but she packed up her gear anyway, not wanting to be present for Larry\u2019s return, to see what emotions flit across his large orange eyes.\n5.\nFrom the platform, she descended the stairs, breathing hard, the smell of her own sweat sour with each hastened step. She hadn\u2019t been in running shape since letting her gym membership lapse two years ago, but she couldn\u2019t allow the man to catch up. If the offer was raised, she couldn\u2019t predict what she would do.\nThat money would make whatever came next in life an easier transition.\nAlva shrugged off the thought.\nThe street leading from the station was poorly lit. Several storefronts displayed tourist attire backlit by low bulbs. T-shirts and hoodies showed depictions of The Heap, some with cartoonish smiling bones for the kids, others with postcard-like vistas for the rest. Each proclaimed the wearer\u2019s visit to The Heap, that i played my part. Alva nearly spat on the glass as she hurried to her hotel.\nThe idea of playing their part, she thought, only came to most people once there was none left to play. They could save the living rather than honor the dead. They could save so much sorrow, and such a long train ride.\nOver her shoulder, down the narrow street, a man\u2019s figure stepped from beneath the station\u2019s awning. Alva wasn\u2019t sure if the silhouette belonged to her man, or just any man. Either way, she ducked into the hotel lobby, nearly knocking into the bellhop, a slew of apologies on her lips.\nIf the man from the train knew she wouldn\u2019t take the money, Alva didn\u2019t know what else he might offer.\n6.\n\u201cAnd?\u201d Alva asked, knowing where her father\u2019s insinuations led.\nThey\u2019d taken to spending nights on the front porch of her parents\u2019 retirement house, a renovated cabin on sixteen acres of fallow farmland. They watched swallows pick apart swarms of gnats and mosquitos over the old pastures. Alva could only make the trip every few months. She feared time away from the forest.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve always got to think what happens after,\u201d her father said.\nShe became defensive. \u201cThere might not be an after. Things could change. It\u2019s not like every woodpecker is tagged. Look at that guy with the extinct foxes under his shed. There could always be another flock up the river, or by the mountains, or\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen how this usually goes,\u201d her mother said, placing a sweating bottle of beer in her daughter\u2019s hand, then taking the seat next to her husband. \u201cYou know why we rarely did follow up shows, right?\u201d\nAlva nodded. \u201cKids TV is supposed to be less depressing than reality.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s one way to put it,\u201d her mother said. \u201cBut we\u2019re getting a bit off topic. Are you still trying those dating sites?\u201d\nAlva sighed. \u201cCan we not talk about this? Please?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me there\u2019s no attractive professors at the college?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo interesting new speakers at one of your conferences?\u201d\n\u201cThings are quiet both in the real world and on the digital front,\u201d Alva said, sipping her beer. \u201cI\u2019ve been practicing my mating call though.\u201d Then she produced a comical series of tweets and rapped her knuckle on the side of the house. \u201cI hope you brought your binoculars. They\u2019re going to come tearing across the field any moment.\u201d\nBoth her parents laughed.\nThey moved away from the topic. No one wanted to sprint down dark roads any longer. The conversation drifted between her recent scholarly paper and her mother\u2019s latest photography project, documenting the decline of abandoned barns across the countryside. She was talking about making a book, about how she preferred to see man-made structures slump into the earth rather than watch forests and other ecosystems disappear.\nThe sun set as the swallows moved back to their roosts, the beat of wings diminishing as stars sparked overhead.\n\u201cI made something for you,\u201d her father said as her mother took their accumulated empties to the kitchen.\nHer father lifted a wooden box from beneath his seat and passed it to Alva. She turned the box over in her hands, inspecting the hinges, the smoothed mahogany, the odd coffin-like construction. On the days he wasn\u2019t at the recording studio narrating low budget documentaries on shellfish, he had begun making bird houses. There was no entrance hole, no mount for the box\u2019s back.\n\u201cIf you ever need it,\u201d he said, pausing. \u201cI seriously hope you don\u2019t, but just in case, you don\u2019t want to be without.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, Dad,\u201d she replied, tucking it under her feet, unable to look at it for more than a second, envisioning her entire life\u2019s work reduced to the narrow confines within.\n7.\nThe path entered the forest, an avenue of pine needles and dirt worn smooth from years of traffic. The forest sung around her: birds and insects, squirrels crossing tree branches, frogs hiccupping near vernal pools. The trees created a corridor, branches woven together, glimpses of the sky\u2019s bright cathedral above.\nAt the path\u2019s end, the shadow of the woods dropped off to stark, nearly blinding white. The sun embellished the huge accumulation of pale bones, washing over the dusty shoreline that circled The Heap. The mountain was vast, steeper than she remembered. Millions of dissected skeletons blotted out the forest behind its peak. All the color bled from her vision until The Heap met the sky. The day was already hot and growing warmer in the open clearing. Skulls gathered her attention, empty eyes and gaping mouths strewn between femurs and spines. Alva fought childhood inclinations to count them, to name them, to construct lives for those already gone.\nA number of gray-back gulls circled overhead. Occasionally they would land and peck about great mound, searching for sinew and muscle, something not yet rotted. Alva couldn\u2019t shoo them off without climbing over the bones, and that wasn\u2019t going to happen. Like her father said, she didn\u2019t want ghosts following her home.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cSo this is afterward,\u201d she said to herself, sitting down, reclining against an oak.\nShe undid the latch. Larry\u2019s skull peered back at her, empty eyes gathering a last look before they were separated. She willed the beak to quiver and speak, to tell her she hadn\u2019t wasted her time, that someone else would read her research and not make the same mistakes. Alva\u2019s singular purpose in life was now relegated to the past, her days rearranging themselves into uncertain futures. She needed the bird\u2019s blessing. Even a single kind squawk would do.\nHe\u2019d been so chatty on the train, why not now?\nThere was a stillness, then the beak jostled, blue tip prodding the box\u2019s side. The rest of the bones swirled about, driftwood caught in a strong seabound current. Startled, Alva almost dropped the miniature coffin. The coo and chortle of the bird\u2019s call rattled through a nonexistent throat, whistling out between parted beak.\nShe\u2019d thought the couple on the train had been exaggerating.\nAlva rose to her feet.\nAs soon as she stood, her legs were swept from beneath her. A booted heel met her shoulder and sent her sprawling. Larry\u2019s coffin tumbled away. The man from the train towered above her, smiling, suit damp about the collar, dirt smeared around the cuffs.\n\u201cThat was a lot of money you passed up,\u201d he said, pulling a knife from inside his suit.\nAlva lunged at the box, but the man stepped between, heel crushing her hand into the dry earth. There was the crack of bone. Sharp pain coursed up her arm like a flood of broken glass. Alva pulled her hand in and curled herself tight, two fingers bent out of alignment.\n\u201cThis is the other reason they always take the money, all your scientist buddies,\u201d the man said, bending to scoop up the box. \u201cI was going to get the bird one way or another. You knew that.\u201d\n\u201cBut why\u2014why do you need him? You have so many already,\u201d Alva gasped through clenched lips.\n\u201cIf this is the last, then I must have it.\u201d He regarded the box. \u201cHave you ever possessed something no one else has? It\u2019s exhilarating! Close to magic. I\u2019ve worked very very hard to build my collection. You wouldn\u2019t believe the number of hours it takes to get these things right.\u201d\n\u201cBut he needs to be in The Heap with the others. He won\u2019t be able to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNope. Old wives\u2019 tales. I\u2019ve taken so many of these and you don\u2019t see a single ghost harassing me. I sleep great! No nightmares.\u201d\nThe man was practically vibrating, his skin flush. His hands tremored as he lifted the lid.\nAlva could rush him, she could drive her shoulder through his bulk\u2026 but no, the pain in her hand wouldn\u2019t let her.\nThe man in the dark suit sucked a breath through his teeth. Then he grew still, head tilted, staring into the mahogany casket. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked no one.\nThe whistle of the woodpecker\u2019s call sounded again from within, followed by the scuttle of bone against wood.\nThe man dropped the box. It landed open in the sand. The bird\u2019s skeleton stepped from the confines, talons grasping hinges, beak prodding the air as if scenting direction. He took a single step on unsure feet, before testing his wings, finding lift, rising from his perch. Bone creaked against bone. He hovered for a moment, a vision of death treading air, before alighting on Alva\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cLess work for me. Already assembled,\u201d the man said, eyes wide as he retrieved the box. \u201cJust get in, little guy, and I won\u2019t break any more of your mom\u2019s fingers.\u201d\nLarry sang again, repeating his mating call, fast and clean.\nThe man stepped forward, shadow falling over Alva\u2019s prone form, knife in hand.\nAlva withdrew, inching backward, from him and the clattering noise. The sound was low at first, but built as skulls and spines pulled together, ribs leading to hips leading to legs, hooves and talons falling into place, rising in cacophony. A gale of sand and bone dust rose around the assembly, clouding The Heap in a harsh haze.\nThe man in the dark suit finally turned as hundreds of species stepped from the swirling sediment: ancient elk and wolves, large cats, eagles and lizards. Something akin to a dinosaur loomed over the gathering, jaw draped open, teeth the size of butcher\u2019s knives. They approached in a horde, eyeless sockets trained on the man, metatarsals and phalanges pushing through sand.\nThe man glanced from the gathering to the forest path, fidgeting with his knife which now seemed more comical than threatening. He took three steps before the creatures dropped on him in a cascading wave of bone, hooves and paws rushing over the ground, jaws wide. Their defined figures collapsed, sweeping him under. His screams were lost by the resonance of skeletons coming apart, separating again into their mismatched chaos.\nThe surge of bones washed up against Alva\u2019s feet as if she had been dangling her toes in the surf. The Heap had shifted several feet towards the woods. Alva searched for the punctuation of color among them, the dark suit, a splash of crimson blood, but she found nothing. Only the sea of white regaining calm, placid and unyielding.\nLarry scuttled across Alva\u2019s shoulder, nipped her ear, and fluttered down to her feet, where he perched on the tip of her shoe. She reached for him. He tilted his skull at her, empty eyes meeting her own. Then he flew off, moving over the rise of The Heap, climbing higher to the summit before his bones separated, form becoming formless.\n8.\nYou\u2019ve always got to think of what happens after, she heard her father say in the back of her head.\nShe still had her job, her meager salary that kept the lights on, her unsuccessful dating apps. There were other species that needed attention: night parrots and crested ibis, Egyptian vultures and California condors. Unfortunately, there would never be a shortage of names on the list. She could spend the weekend at her parents\u2019 house, following the swallows, contemplating the last paper she\u2019d write about her time in the forest and what actually came after.\nThere had to be a final chapter, death and the wave of bones not solely restricted to memory. She didn\u2019t know who\u2019d publish something like that, what academic journals would call the work anything other than fiction. She\u2019d worry about that later. Even if her paper went ignored like all the others, at least the writing would exist, at least she had tried. Compassion would have to come from others.\nMaybe the article would be a character study, a look at modern psyches and where they failed the human species and all those around them. Superfluous desires outweighed the need for healthy ecosystems, healthy relationships in general, a never-ending divorce from reality sprawling through decades.\nAlva didn\u2019t know the paper\u2019s final form, but she knew where to start. The words twitched in the fingers of her non-broken hand, a ghost keyboard laid out before her, playing just beyond her reach.\nThe first sentence came to her as rough bark wore against her shoulder blades. The number of men who prefer to horde bones rather than protect life is alarming.\nWithout further hesitation, she returned to the forest path, leaving the coffin with the distributed remains.\nShe didn\u2019t want to miss the last train home.\nSomeone else would put the casket to better use.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue35\/3lbe35_story3.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"When the train rattled, the bones in the mahogany box at Alva's side rattled back.

There was no there to get to. The car would drive on forever, and his parents in the front seat would never answer, for they were both dead.\nFather said they were driving to Tomorrow, but Tomorrow had come and gone.\nOutside, the hypnotic monochrome highway ripped along, lit by the shooting stars of passing headlights and the golden harvest moon that rolled effortlessly alongside them, watching but offering no sage advice, let alone help. Ramsey was frightened of the other cars, still more by the moon, but he would much rather watch it than look at the toy in his hands for fear of seeing the tiny tin boy inside it looking back at him, or at his mother, or at the ragged absence of his father\u2019s head.\nThis was the third night of the drive, and Ramsey\u2019s first night alone in the touring car. They traveled west on the Great Interstate, the mighty 22, four broad lanes of new-minted black corduroy tarmac as straight as a knife of starless night bisecting the eternal plain.\nThe radio hissed as the last whisper of the Chicago jazz station was swallowed up by waves of static. The clever car searched the airwaves for the nearest island of manmade sound, settled on a quavering cowboy crooner in Wichita who howled at the moon.\nAnd the car rolled on, past fields and forests and sleeping cities and towns. The steering wheel rocked back and forth, making tiny corrections to stay within its lane. Tiny light sensors built into the undercarriage tracked the dotted white lines, steering and maintaining the speed long after the driver had gone as cold as the wind blowing in through the open window. Cruise control, Father called it; only the least amazing of the innovations that went into this, the prototype of the Cobb Crusader, the touring car of Tomorrow.\nRamsey closed his eyes and tried to comfort himself by humming the tune Father taught him, and though it sounded strange even to his ears, the habit of it soothed his nerves so long as he kept his eyes clenched tight. Father loved music almost as much as he loved cars, but the music he loved most set Mother\u2019s teeth on edge, and led to frequent arguments over what music was.\nFather said music, as Cage and Schoenberg and other modernists created or destroyed it, was pure mathematics, the sound of truth, and he found the atonal discordance of the chromatic scale totally life-affirming. Ramsey sat for an hour a day with Mother at the piano, pounding out Bach and Beethoven like newspaper copy, but the alien coldness of the modernists touched him in a purer way than other music, though it was colored by his boundless adoration for Father. The composition he hummed now was rigorously rhythmic, though so randomly tuneless that it might have been the sound of wind chimes.\nWhen he felt better, Ramsey looked out the passenger side window and tried to figure where they were. If they were leaving Illinois, they were not quite halfway there. The car would follow the highway to their final destination, which was Los Angeles, and would not stop until it got there. The papers and the newsreel cameras would be waiting, all fired up to introduce Father\u2019s car, and the revolutionary chemical formula that propelled it, to the world.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhen the car was finished, Father and his investors hired a squad of armed ex-Marines to guard it until arrangements could be made for its maiden voyage. Pinkerton goons sabotaged the public unveiling at the garage in Boston, deflecting reporters with a rumor that the event was a hoax, and trying to pull him over in fake police uniforms. But Father outwitted them, sending a dressed-up Studebaker as a decoy from the declared location, which the goons ran off the road on Boylston Street.\nFather\u2019s agent wired the west coast press, promising an extraordinary event. A newsreel crew followed the car out of Boston and down to New York City, crossing the George Washington Bridge with their whirring cameras trained on the waving family in the touring car of Tomorrow, until they had to turn off to get gas. Another crew would catch them in Pittsburgh, and another in Chicago, and so on, capturing each leg of the brave family\u2019s nonstop transcontinental trip.\nTo be sure, Father would pull over at farmers\u2019 stands and roadside eateries with a drive-thru window when the icebox\u2019s store of sandwiches and fruit got to be too much, and at service stations when Mother couldn\u2019t be persuaded to avail herself of the ingenious sanitation system built into the seats; but the engine would never shut off. Father never got out from behind the wheel, except for a momentary stretch while Mother made her toilette.\nOver the first leg of the trip, Ramsey never saw Father sleep a wink or take a bite of food, though his nervous energy mounted with each state they crossed. Mother had trained to operate the car and insisted that he let her take a shift, but he kept putting her off. Like the car, he seemed to need no rest and only a swallow of water to travel any distance. He spoke less and less with Mother, hardly acknowledged his son, only the road and his maps and the buzzing voices on the wireless radio.\nRamsey knew Father was always in touch with one of his \u201cuncles,\u201d the odd squad of engineers, chemists and business-types who helped build the car. The talk was jaunty at first, but soon grew shrill and snappy, the words longer, except for the four-letter variety. Mother urged him to pull over and let her drive, to get some rest before he wrecked them. \u201cI\u2019ll sleep when the car\u2019s made history, dear, and not before.\u201d\nAnd that was the problem. From what little he could gather, the uncles had made no headway with the press, and even less with major investors. They were totally blacked out. The papers, the radio and newsreel bureaus wouldn\u2019t relay a word about the trip, which, by now, was supposed to be \u201ca coast-to-coast sensation!\u201d But nobody knew about them. The cars and trucks they passed on the highway showed no recognition of their importance, aside from a few odd glances at the Crusader\u2019s radically streamlined body.\nThose whom Father hoped would mass-produce the Crusader were even more tight-lipped. Someone had leaked the Cobb Automobile Co. prospectus and a contact list, and everyone who might have helped them to build the Car of Tomorrow had been paid off or threatened, and then begged off.\nIn Chicago, it had come to a boil. As they approached the gray spires of the city, a truck closed in behind them, and Father slowed down to let what he thought was the Movietone crew catch up and begin filming. Ramsey had been napping, and woke to Mother shaking him and wiping peanut butter off his face with a spit-slick thumb. She straightened and yanked on his tie until black spots blotted out his sight.\nThe truck came up alongside and a camera was pointed at them, but the man in the front passenger seat pointed at the breakdown lane and waved a sign with a string of numbers on it. Father cursed and fiddled with the dials on the wireless, then went white and silent as a tinny voice whispered in his ear.\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said, but the voice rattled on. \u201cGod damn you,\u201d he said, but on it went. Ramsey watched the truck getting closer, running neck-and-neck with them, almost close enough for the pointing man to reach in and grab the wheel.\nMother demanded to know what was happening, but Father ignored her and spun the dials again. \u201cCharlie, what is this bullshit? Who are these goddamned people, and why are they talking like they own my car?\u201d\nHe listened, jaw tensing as he chewed his lip. \u201cBut every damned innovation on this car was individually patented. The engine, the tires, the wireless telephone tap\u2026 All that fucking paperwork just doesn\u2019t disappear. I\u2019m\u2014yes, I fucking well am asking you what really happened\u2026\u201d\nFather shook his head so violently at whatever Uncle Charlie said that the headset slipped down around his ears. \u201cCharlie, this isn\u2019t about the law. This isn\u2019t about the goddamned company! This isn\u2019t even about the goddamned car! This is about perpetual motion! This is about a thousand miles and counting, non-stop, on a gallon of water! It\u2019s about changing the world and building the future, and they\u2019re trying to bury it! Don\u2019t let them bury it, Charlie, for the love of God, don\u2019t let them\u2014\u201d\nRamsey heard his father cry for the first time, and covered his eyes. The sobs turned into a raw-throated scream and the car swerved, throwing Ramsey across the enormous back seat. Crayons snapped under him and magazines spilled into the cavernous foot wells.\nThe truck filled up the driver\u2019s side windows, and the pointing man climbed out onto the running board. He hung by the doorpost of the truck in the whipping wind with his other hand out to reach into Father\u2019s open window.\nFather swung the car away from the truck and rolled up his window. The touring car leapt forward, accelerating and swerving towards the center line to cut off the truck. The driver of the truck was no chicken, and strove to choke off the car\u2019s escape.\nThe man on the running board hefted a crowbar. Ramsey saw it and let out a piercing, wordless scream, but Father closed the gap and feinted at the truck, pulling the car back at the last instant. The passenger lunged out and smashed Father\u2019s window. The glass was crazed with blue cracks, but it held. Father\u2019s hysterical laughter was worse than his tears. \u201cSee, what did I tell you, Madeline? How about that safety glass! And they want to bury it\u2014\u201d\nFather floored the gas pedal and easily outpaced the truck, climbing through a convoy of semi trailers like they were going backwards, like the car would keep accelerating until they ran right off the edge of the earth and into the infinite. \u201cLook at how the suspension handles, Maddy! Do you hear that, Charlie, you backstabbing son of a bitch? That\u2019s the Car of Tomorrow doing ninety miles in fourth gear on a highway! Sounds like a fly snoring, doesn\u2019t it, you Judas-goat bastard? Everyone in the world is going to want one of these!\u201d\nMother tried to calm him down, but Father was beyond contact. He elbowed the safety glass out of the window and climbed up on the seat, sticking his head and shoulders out into the wind. He thumbed the cruise control lever on the steering column. The car barely slacked off before resuming its insane speed. They rode the exact center of the passing lane between four lanes of traffic, a mad symphony of horns in their wake as if their gas-guzzling rivals, at least, recognized what passed among them, and were frantic to destroy it.\nMother shrieked and slapped at Father\u2019s back, but he was oblivious as he screamed into the wind, trying to sell his car.\n\u201cCity of Chicago, I give you Cobb Automobile\u2019s Prototype C\u2026 the Cobb Crusader! A bold new type of car for a bold new age! Folks, meet the last car you\u2019ll ever have to buy, and say goodbye to the gas pump, because this little fucking wonder runs on water! No shit, Chicago!\u201d\nMother tugged at Father\u2019s sweat-grimed shirttails, but his frenzied hand batted her away.\n\u201cThe revolutionary engine under the hood is a self-contained fuel cell that is recharged by the motion of the car! The longer you drive, the further you can go, in effortless, laser-guided style that makes accidents almost impossible! And get a load of these other features! Self-sealing, puncture-resistant, seventy-two-nacelle vulcanized rubber tires! You can\u2019t hurt these little sonsofbitches! Interchangeable, dent-resistant aluminum body molding panels, so you can update and customize the color and style of your Crusader as the years go by! Wireless radio transceiver, so you\u2019re never out of touch with the world at large! Cruise control and automatic navigation, so even a sleeping baby can keep the car on the road! Three-point safety belts, fold-down backseat bunk beds, a refrigerator, flush toilets\u2026 America, you\u2019re going to love this car so goddamned much, you\u2019ll want to be buried in it\u2014\u201d\nThe truck dropped away behind them with a whinnying squeal of brakes. Ramsey looked up from the chapel of his hands. Father leaned out even further into the wind. The deep, bellicose blast of a horn sounded from ahead of them, and steadily grew louder.\n\u201cAnd all parts on the Cobb Crusader come with a lifetime guaran\u2014\u201d\nThe oncoming truck grazed the dent-resistant aluminum body panels and took his father from the neck up, and made a bloody pennant of his left arm.\nA scarlet curtain of blood fanned across Ramsey\u2019s window. The truck slewed sideways in the road behind them, still bellowing its rage and disbelief as the car rolled on.\nMother howled as she pulled Father back into his seat, but then went giddily mute, fussing over his tie and refilling his coffee as if all was well. She eased back the cruise control lever, slowing the car to sixty. She shook in her safety harness as if she\u2019d just been dragged from a frozen lake. She looked all around the car and out the window, everywhere but at Father, or her son.\nHe reached for her, but she gently pushed him back onto the seat. \u201cFasten your safety belt, young man. And stop that sobbing. You\u2019re disturbing your father.\u201d\nRamsey wasn\u2019t aware he\u2019d been crying, but he bit his lip and did as he was told. Beyond the headrest of the driver\u2019s seat, there was no Father visible, but Father\u2019s car sailed on down the highway, now bearing southwest out of Springfield, and a straight shot to Kansas City, Albuquerque, Los Angeles, and points west.\n\u201cKeep it down, there\u2019s a good boy. Mother\u2019s got a headache, and she\u2019s going to take a nap. Father\u2019s very tired, too, but he\u2019s waiting for Uncle Charlie to call back.\u201d\nAll out of speech, she seemed to switch off, but then she added, her eyes seeking his for the first and last time since they set out from Boston. \u201cI know all this looks bleak, but your father will win through, because he\u2019s one of the just. He\u2019s a good man, bringing the light of a new age across America, and we\u2019re very lucky to be accompanying him. It\u2019s a ride into history\u2014into Tomorrow, rather\u2026\u201d She blinked and pressed her blue-white hands against her temples. \u201cMother has a headache,\u201d she repeated. \u201cDo you have a headache, Ramsey? Do you need something to help you sleep?\u201d\nHe shook his head. She bent and rummaged in the first aid kit and came up with the bottle of pills she used to sleep on the road. They were very strong and they always made her snore. She shook some out in her hand and washed them down with a drink from a flask. She looked at Ramsey once, but he pretended to be dozing. He heard her fill her hand with pills and drink from the flask three more times. She turned up the radio on a ballroom broadcast from WBG in Chicago. \u201cSleep,\u201d she said once, and Ramsey guessed she did, but this time, the pills did not make her snore at all.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe scenery rolled by outside, the new-minted sunlight painting the green and gold Iowa countryside in Medieval oils, like a page from the Book of Hours. His bloated bladder throbbed and his stomach growled and twisted like an angry snake inside him, but the icebox was set into the passenger side of the drive train, beside Mother\u2019s knee. He used the foldout toilet under the seat, stowed his itchy wool army blanket and changed into a clean shirt and blazer from the suitcase in the trunk.\nThe Kansas cowboy crooner had long since fallen away, and now an Oklahoma minister harangued the car about the wages of sin. Dancing waves of static, not unlike one of the angular, chromatic musical experiments Father so dearly loved, lapped around the minister\u2019s voice, and Ramsey imagined him and his whole congregation in a blizzard of red snow, church and sermon being devoured bit by bit, like the highest towers of Atlantis sinking beneath the waves.\nHe rolled down his window. The wind burned his face like the breath of an oven, but the spray of blood across the glass no longer obscured his view. They were still in the passing lane, and Ramsey could see only a handful of trucks and cars between him and the horizon in either direction.\nSomething must be done. Father would never just sit still in such a predicament. No matter how dim their prospects, he would take charge.\nThere was no one to help him. Father was indisputably dead. Mother, likewise. She leaned against her window with her face tucked into her shoulder against the faintly tinted glass. He could see only her neck, which was pale and waxen, and one hand curled in her lap.\nHe didn\u2019t want to think she\u2019d meant not to wake up. Father was her whole world, and Ramsey had never had any illusions about how she saw her son. He was Father\u2019s creature, to be loved and nurtured as such, but without Father, she could not go on.\nRamsey felt cold grip his heart and lungs, and knew he should blame her, even hate her, for deserting him, but it made no sense. It wouldn\u2019t stop this, it wouldn\u2019t break this endless moment, stop this fever-dream from going on forever, so he put it down.\nHe had to stop the car. He could not depend on help. The wireless would not work, the headset was back in Chicago with Father\u2019s head. Even if he could hail a fellow traveler, they would probably only get themselves hurt or killed. The men who tried to stop them in Illinois would catch up soon, or head them off, but Ramsey felt no panic in contemplation of this. Better to crash and burn, Father would say, than let it fall to them. The car was all of Father that remained, all that he had dreamed and worked for, and he would not let them have it.\nHe would have to drive.\nOnce, Father had let him sit on his lap and steer the Crusader while he worked the pedals. In the vast, empty lot of Fenway Park, he\u2019d clung to the enormous wheel and wrestled the car into a lopsided elliptical loop again and again until long after the sun went down. He\u2019d felt as if he were at the helm of a gigantic steamship, or somehow driving the whole wide world, piloting the great blue globe through the solar system in a cosmic slot race.\nLooking down the sleek hood of the Crusader at the triple splash of illuminated asphalt in front of him, with Father\u2019s voice whispering in his ear but never touching his hands or the wheel, the whole of creation suddenly seemed much smaller than it had before, and would never seem so dauntingly large again. \u201cSon,\u201d Father had said, \u201cyou can drive, which I suppose puts you more than halfway to what passes for manhood, around here.\u201d\nHe could drive the car, but it wasn\u2019t that part of it he was afraid of.\nLong after the plan lay in place, he still sat and gathered himself for what he would have to do. Back here, he would die before he reached LA. He was thirsty and starving, and he had to get off the highway. He had to. He had to\u2014\nHe knew what Father would do. He would simply do it.\nSlowly, pins and needles melting in his cramped limbs, Ramsey straightened and put his feet down on the floor. He closed his eyes and held his breath, and his hands went up to the front headrests, gripped the lush velvet padding. Father\u2019s was rigid with dried blood, and Mother\u2019s was draped in her windblown hair. His hands wanted to go numb and let go, but he couldn\u2019t weaken, now. If he did, he\u2019d never get up again. Willing his hands to become dead clamps, he hauled his body up off the seat and slid forward until his chin perched on the bench seat between the two rests.\nHe let the breath out, but didn\u2019t open his eyes.\nHe waited for a magical miracle to save him, like in the Bible. Then he opened his eyes.\nFather sat stiff and straight and headless behind the wheel. His right arm lay across his lap like a leash where Mother had dropped it after pulling his remains back in the window.\nBy selectively staring at him from the shoulders down, Ramsey could almost pretend that Father\u2019s head was still there, could almost hear his voice muttering at Uncle Charlie about the car\u2019s performance. If one looked around the mangled stump of Father\u2019s neck or the maroon apron of gore down the front of his white Arrow shirt, he could tell himself Father was just fine, it had all been a bad dream\u2014\nMother was easier to look at, at first. With her face turned to the glass, she might have been napping, though her bosom did not stir, and the glass was not fogged by breath. The car of Tomorrow had stopped time, and she lay still forever in the instant between breaths, between heartbeats. He fought the childish impulse to shake her and try to break the spell.\nIf a miracle was going to save him, it would have happened before now. At her feet, through the icebox window, beaded with condensation, he saw regimented rows of sandwiches, a bunch of bananas, a basket of strawberries and a jug of water. He fixed his sights on this as he stepped up onto the seats, flinching reflexively at imaginary warnings to get his shoes off the upholstery.\nHe levered his arms on the front seats and sprang over before his mind could recoil and take it back. He went over the bench into the space between his parents, slithered into the spill of maps and checklists. He jerked away from the touch of Father\u2019s hand, the rigor mortis making the fingers into a rake that gouged his side. He rolled over against Mother\u2019s thigh and slipped down onto the floorboard. Mother\u2019s knees dug into his back, but he couldn\u2019t squeeze himself any further under the dash to get away, so he willed himself to ignore it.\nThe icebox made it easier. He tore open the tight sheath of wax paper on a sandwich without checking what it was. Just the smell of Father\u2019s pastrami and Swiss cheese with onions normally soured him on the idea of food itself, but he devoured it, biting his own thumb in his zeal. He sluiced out his guts with the water, spilling and splashing it over his blood-sticky fingers and face.\nWith the water inside him, he could suppress his childish fears, but the grown-up ones became much worse. The gravity of the future beyond this trip pulled him down. He could drive the car or let it drive itself, but there would be an end to the road, and life beyond that suddenly seemed as unimaginable as life beyond the grave.\nHe was an orphan. Father and Mother had no family to take him in. Father\u2019s fortunes were bound up in the company, and the company was gone, swallowed up by the invisible forces that secretly ran the world. There would be no Cobb Crusader, no bold new age of free energy and immortal automobiles, no perpetual motion highway to Tomorrow. Father and Mother had chosen to die rather than go into the blighted future that was left to them. How could he hope to fare any better?\nIf he was a man, he might have crumbled under such a choice, but he had not yet learned to reach the pedals. He had nothing left except the car, which, in every real sense, possessed him.\nLife in the car might not be so bad. He could stop and bury his parents and just keep driving. In Russia, Father said, Stalin had the Reds building roads all over, even though nobody had a car, just building in a mad frenzy of empty effort, roads going from nowhere to nowhere, round and round in circles. To drive across eleven time zones of empty countryside like that, like a nomad on the Steppes, forever and ever, would not be so bad a fate\u2026\nHe screwed his eyes shut and climbed out of the foot well, clutching the dashboard while splaying his legs around Mother\u2019s still form. As he stood, he looked back as the car went over a bump and her face turned and stared into his. Her eyes were glazed marbles that showed him his shrinking reflection as he screamed and retreated back into the foot well.\nDeath had not granted her a gentle refuge. In sleep, something had come for her that contorted her ashen face into a tragic mask, some revelation even darker than what had driven her to swallow all her pills at once. A strand of drool hung from her slack jaw and anchored itself to the beaded breast of her cashmere sweater.\nThis is not Mother, he told himself, screwing his eyes shut and forcing his mind to work its own magic. Do not remember her like this, don\u2019t let this picture stay in your head, this is just a body\u2026 just like an empty car.\nThat made it okay, somehow. He opened his eyes and saw what he had to do next. He climbed over her and into the space between the bodies. He took hold of Father\u2019s hand and wrenched it over to lay it across Mother\u2019s thigh. Then he turned around and shifted his weight into his father\u2019s lap.\nHe had expected the seat to be hard and cold, like the porch glider in front of their house in autumn, but the flabby softness of his father\u2019s flesh, the turgid swelling of his belly like a hot water bottle, made Ramsey sick up a little. The body took on his weight with a horrid shifting of gas pockets and decaying fluids. Fetid swamp gas erupted from Father\u2019s neck and bottom at the same time, a ripe one so loud and rank Ramsey might have died of giggles, if he was not so very close to vomiting.\nRamsey exhaled and clamped shut his lips, plugged his nose until the spell passed. He leaned out into the bracing wind and screamed at the top of his lungs. A sign said Tucumcari was fifty miles away, and to stop at the McCutcheon Ranch roadside diner for pie and coffee and a glimpse of Mystery Myrtle, the Living Headless Chicken. A flatbed truck with a tower of chicken cages honked at him as he passed it.\nRamsey relaxed in his dead father\u2019s lap and put his hands on the wheel. On the radio, the plague of static had eaten up the fire-breathing minister, and Ramsey turned the dial until he found a station that played big band records out of Albuquerque. An eternally prolonged, ever-intensifying Gene Krupa drum solo went on and on as he gripped the wheel, the syncopated polyrhythms clashing and crashing into strange new forms as predatory horns prowled the underbrush, avid with menace, baring teeth and claws at the horn section searching for the smallest break through which to pounce and reclaim the song. Ramsey bobbed his head jerkily to the beat, his jaw working in counterpoint as the tuneless pattern of notes his father taught him began to spill out over the rhythm.\nAn exit swam up out of the rolling sand-pastures, a sign pointing the way down an oiled gravel two-lane road to somewhere called Waterloo. His feet kicked uselessly at the distant pedals, but he could steer.\nRamsey pushed the cruise control lever down and shut it off, and the car immediately began to slow. He yanked the wheel down hard and rejoiced as the car began to bank, turning off the highway and nosing towards the Waterloo exit.\nThe car jerked, the defiant wheel returning to station under his hand, aimed straight as ever down the passing lane. The cruise control came back on and the car sped up to sixty.\nRamsey\u2019s hands flew off the wheel as if he\u2019d been shocked. They twitched in the air like dead frog legs galvanized by electrical current, as if the hideous vitality of the car had been transmitted into him. He leaned back, squeezing a gust of stale air and curdled blood from Father\u2019s neck-hole, and rebounded against the wheel and expelled all his breath. Eyes tearing up, he screamed, \u201cLet me go! What do you want?\u201d\n\u201cWe want to help you, Ramsey,\u201d a voice came from the radio, so clear and crisp it might have spoken inside his own head. It was the voice of the Car of Tomorrow, the one innovation Father had failed to tell him about. \u201cWe can help you, but first, we have to know\u2026\u201d\nRamsey looked around for some sign of life, but aside from the glimmering lights of the instrument panel, he saw nothing untoward, no staring electrical eyes peering out of the dash.\n\u201cYour father confided in you, Ramsey, didn\u2019t he? He told you everything about the Crusader, and how it worked.\u201d\nRamsey felt his heart sink. It wasn\u2019t the car. With the car, he might have struck a bargain. The car only wanted to drive, to go on forever, and he could accept that, he could give himself to it, but the voices on the radio were the men from the oil companies.\n\u201cYour father built one hell of a car, son, but he did something to it, we can\u2019t figure out\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou go to hell!\u201d he screamed, and yanked the wheel again. As before, it tugged back against him, shrugging off his weight and returning to its course. He pulled harder, throwing all his weight against it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s useless, Ramsey\u2014\u201d\nThey would stop him. They would take the car. They would steal Father\u2019s most prized invention, the super-conductive polymer that made the fuel cell extract hydrogen from water and channeled the energy to create a perfect engine. Other fuel cells were made with gold, and cost millions to do the work of a few dry-cell batteries. Father\u2019s was a thousand times more efficient because of the molecular arcana he worked on the polymer. The notes he\u2019d left behind in Boston were all flawed forgeries, the originals all burned. The only remaining copy was folded in Father\u2019s breast pocket, the single sheet of paper he\u2019d hoped to show the world in Los Angeles.\n\u201cYour father would have wanted his work to live on, to help people, son. Don\u2019t you see that?\u201d\nWithout looking, he reached behind him for the pocket, and he could already taste the melted-chocolate-copper bloody pulp of it in his mouth. He gagged on it as if he\u2019d done it and done it and would have to do it again, but the bastards would make him keep doing it until he slipped up, and they won.\nHe dug deeper and deeper into the pocket and hit bottom. There was no paper. Had he already eaten it? Maybe he forgot it.\nHe stretched out and touched the brake, slid down below the dash and stomped it as he held onto the wheel. Something popped horribly out of true in his shoulder. The car seized up and felt as if it stood on its front end for a moment, then it was sliding sideways.\nThen it stopped.\n\u201cGoddamit, that\u2019s not supposed to happen\u2014\u201d\nRamsey hauled on the door latch and threw himself out onto the road. His bones sang with the vibrations of the car ride. He clung to the stillness of the asphalt, pouring all his inertia into it until his body began to shake with honest, cleansing sobs of grief.\nHe heard sirens.\nHe climbed to his knees and looked around. The Interstate passed through a cattle pasture in the purpling dusk. The sun was setting a few degrees to the left of the highway, and on the horizon, he saw the glittering lights of the city of Albuquerque. Then it all flickered and dimmed, and switched off.\nRamsey screamed at the dark. He tried to climb back into the car, but the door was locked. Through his fingers, he saw that the road and the car were all that was left of the world.\nThe two-lane highway was enclosed in a tunnel of corrugated glass that looked like enormous versions of the television screens he saw once at the World\u2019s Fair. Where it had lain straight as a plumb line across half of America, the highway now bent away in both directions, describing part of an enclosed, circular track. A slot ran down the center of the road with a woven steel cable down inside it like the cable cars in San Francisco. The cable was wrenched out of the slot where the Cobb Crusader prototype sat sideways on the road.\nThere was no Albuquerque, no Chicago, no Los Angeles. The car ran on the track, round and round inside the television tunnel, forever.\nRamsey tried to get up, but he felt so heavy, so weak, he decided to just sit back down on the road. No cars were coming, the wailing sirens never getting closer. He looked at his hands, marveled at the wrinkles and brown spots, at the forest of blue veins under rice-paper skin. When did that happen?\nJust ahead of the car, the television tunnel opened up, and the sirens got much louder. He put his hands over his ears, but the sound went right through, right into the metal in his dentures.\nA big truck that looked like the god of all dung beetles with red flashing lights all over it rolled into the road. Men poured down off it with firehoses and boxes of tools, and they surrounded Father\u2019s car. Two men in white coats came and stood over him, sorrowfully shaking their heads. Ramsey tried to make out their faces, but they seemed so tall, clouds closed over their faces.\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting worse. If he had anything to tell us, if he even knew, don\u2019t you think he would have, by now?\u201d\n\u201cHave you got a better idea?\u201d\nThey just stood over him. His head hurt. He supposed they were going to give him more of the medicine that clouded his head until next time, but right now, he could almost understand what they needed. When one of them leaned down to put his face close and meet his gaze, Ramsey really wanted to help.\n\u201cNow\u2026 Mr. Cobb, I need for you to try to listen to me. It\u2019s very important. Can you do that?\u201d\nRamsey tried to nod. The muscles in his neck felt like rusty baling wire.\n\u201cGood, good,\u201d the man sputtered excitedly. \u201cYour father made this car so that it could run forever\u2014in theory\u2014but we\u2019ve reverse engineered it from the ground up, and we can\u2019t duplicate the process, we can\u2019t figure out why ours won\u2019t work. Do you understand?\u201d\nWhen he was in the car the first time, he ate the note, but they never knew, so they put nothing in fake Father\u2019s pocket.\nHe opened his mouth to speak now, but no sound would come out. He didn\u2019t know if his voice box had given out, or if his mind would not let him speak, the car would not let him tell it any way but the way Father taught him\u2014\n\u201cNow, we\u2019re sorry for this ruse, but it\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no more oil, Ramsey. We\u2019re dying on our feet. Outside, the food riots, the civil wars\u2026 It\u2019s all coming apart, but we can still save it. The future your father worked to build, to make it happen, you have to help us. Do you understand?\u201d\nRamsey understood. His father understood, too, had known all along. He had prepared Ramsey for this. Ever the absent-minded inventor, Father employed a myriad of mnemonic devices, like committing his formula to musical notes.\nRamsey hummed them now, staring fixedly into the man\u2019s eyes and waving his hands to make him understand that the song detailed the chemical process for the chain reaction that powered the car. He sang the atonal notes louder and louder, but the man\u2019s face crumpled and his arm cocked as if he wanted to smash Ramsey\u2019s face in.\n\u201cAgain?\u201d his colleague crowed. \u201cThat\u2019s all he ever does. He\u2019s cracked\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe knows,\u201d the other man snarled. \u201cI can see it in his goddamned eyes. Tell them to fix the cable and get the replica back on the track. Clean him up, get him back in the car and doped up.\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a long drive ahead of him.\u201d","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue30\/3lbe30_story2.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"Eight year-old Ramsey Arthur Cobb sat bolt upright on the backseat of Father\u2019s car in his houndstooth Sunday suit, the fingers of one sweaty hand kneading the burgundy crushed velvet upholstery until it squeaked, the other clutching the tin replica\u2026","filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/LKmtBo-fnCnlrFmqvnHOmpgPAcI.json"}

A few hundred paces along the path, past a grove of gnarled ancestor trees, her guards lingered outside an abandoned longhouse. It had been easy to find volunteers; more difficult had been convincing the rest of the villagers to stay away. Pareetha had chosen the young women and men with the steadiest hands and coolest tempers.\nThe wind shifted, carrying with it the stench of rotting wounds, rancid food, and unwashed bodies. Sevi coughed and covered her nose.\n\u201cIf just one of them trips, they\u2019ll all topple down the pass in a heap,\u201d she said, her voice muffled by her glove. She was thirteen years old. She had never known a life without war. \u201cThen we\u2019ll be smelling them forever.\u201d\n\u201cHush,\u201d said Pareetha. The soldiers plodded only a few feet from them. She looked over the tops of their heads, very few protected from the cold, and tried not to meet their eyes.\nSevi dropped her hand and sighed. \u201cI just want them gone. I want them gone forever.\u201d\nPareetha\u2019s heart ached to hear the weariness in her daughter\u2019s voice. \u201cAs do I.\u201d\nA pause, then Sevi added, more quietly, \u201cI want him gone forever.\u201d\nThey turned, as one, to look up the road.\nOn a switchback above the junction, a tall red carriage tilted precariously as it rounded the bend. The Virtue\u2019s seal, a white heart inside a yellow moon, glared from the broad side. The Virtue\u2019s flags, the same symbol upon a field of red, whipped and snapped in the wind. In the mountain twilight, the red paint was fading to muddy black. It towered over the soldiers and carts, its wooden wheels rattling on the rough road, the leather straps of its suspension creaking with every bump. A team of eight buffalo, their horns filed to nubs, plodded in harnesses of red leather and tarnished silver. The creatures were so skinny their ribs made washboards of their flanks.\nPareetha had been watching the carriage since it had lumbered over the first pass and began its precarious journey into the valley, a drumbeat of expectation in her chest. Excitement is not so different from fear, her mother used to say, words Pareetha had not understood until her mother died and the war began. A thread of smoke rose from a chimney on the carriage\u2019s roof. The Virtue had always been too thin-skinned to endure the cold of this land he had tried to conquer.\nHer thoughts uncoiling like a whip, Pareetha imagined the carriage tipping, the carriage toppling, a slow fall that would scatter the soldiers around it like ants. The stove or brazier within would spill its coals into curtains, into cushions, into extravagant silk robes. The mountains would echo with the deafening crash. Fire would engulf the splintered red box.\nThe man inside would scream.\nThe air would smell, briefly, of cooked meat.\nSnow and rain would eventually wash away the smear of greasy black ash.\nBe careful of your dark thoughts, her mother would have said, for the ancestors might hear you. When she was young and curled at her mother\u2019s feet, wide-eyed with wonder as the wise woman talked and laughed, Pareetha had believed the warning. But if the ancestors in their ancient trees had heard her pleas these past twenty years, they had not seen fit to answer.\nShe stepped to the edge of the boulder and raised her hand. The nearest soldiers stopped so suddenly they bumped into one another. Murmurs and whispers carried along the line, a tremulous ripple. Pareetha heard them say witch. She heard them say nightfall. She hated the rough sound of their southern language. On the fields outside Kint\u2019s mud-plastered walls, the soldiers had been stunned. They had been angry. They had been defiant. They had not understood how they could have been defeated by mountain nomads, barbarians, squabbling family clans, knotty-haired hedge-witches, savages.\nNow their faces showed only weariness, or nothing at all.\nA woman riding horseback, dressed in a captain\u2019s uniform, drew her horse alongside the rock where Pareetha and Sevi were standing. Her hair was the same dull, dirty gray as her mount. Her face was broad, her jaw as square as the butt of an ax. She had to look up to address Pareetha.\n\u201cWe regret to you this imposition on your peace,\u201d the woman said. She was clumsy with the Sufa tongue, carefully stepping her way through the formal constructions like a drunkard picking through the aftermath of a tavern fight. \u201cWe are the one who is Ona. We ask to you grant us pass your lands on this way. We ask to you read to us what would be read.\u201d\nTo her credit, Ona did not sound like she had grown bored of making this request, although she must have made it half a hundred times before, in every village and town the army had passed on its long retreat, before every clan elder or witch council. They had been marching south for three months. This cold, lonely valley, called the Gates of Ice by those who lived here, was their last stop before they left Sufa for good.\n\u201cOver there,\u201d Pareetha said, pointing to the building where the young guards waited. Earlier they had cleaned the old chimney to light a fire. The longhouse had been empty since its previous inhabitants had died in the prison at Blueswallow at the hands of the Virtue\u2019s torturers. \u201cThat is where your master will hear us.\u201d\nOna looked. \u201cThere?\u201d\nPareetha could not tell if it was fear or distaste that passed over her face. \u201cThere.\u201d\nThe captain did not answer for so long Pareetha began to wonder if she was going to refuse and risk punishment. The witches of Halap Peak, far to the north, had woven a binding of obedience over the Virtue and his commanders while he remained within Sufa. Pareetha did not know what the binding would do should he test it, but it was unlikely to be pleasant. Halap women wore rattling armor fashioned from the bones of their ancestors and trained mountain cats to carry their minds on long-ranging hunts. Two hundred and thirty-seven of their sisters had been burned alive when the Virtue\u2019s army sacked a temple in the Qista Valley. Those who survived were neither squeamish nor forgiving.\nFinally Ona said, \u201cI will bring him.\u201d\nShe tugged on the reins to bring her horse about. She paused when her gaze fell on the grove of the ancestors. These were ancient trees, so twisted by wind none was much taller than a man, so gnarled their dark bark had long ago enclosed the bones buried within. Nobody knew the names of the ancestors who rested in this grove, only that they had been the first to settle in the Gates of Ice, the first to make the shores of White Bear Lake their home, the first to call upon the power of the mountains and glaciers and cold winter wind to weave spells of protection and strength over this lonely valley.\nThe valley's nine wise women had known their names. But that knowledge, and so much more, had been lost when they were murdered. Sometimes, in quiet moments late at night, Pareetha whispered nonsense syllables to herself, trying in vain to echo her mother\u2019s cadence, trying to draw what was lost from the darkest folds of her childhood memories. It never worked. She could not recall the sound of her mother\u2019s voice.\n\u201cI do not know what promise is kindly offered by this place,\u201d Ona said.\nShe was not looking at the ancestor trees anymore. She was looking at Pareetha, and the words might have been a taunt, but there was no mockery in her voice. Sevi, at Pareetha\u2019s side, was holding her breath. The soldiers around the captain pretended not to listen.\nWhen the treaty negotiations had begun on the plains of Kint, The Virtue, surrounded by his cardinals, had spent days demurring and debating, repeating and reneging, never agreeing, never conceding. One day he would thank the people of Sufa for their mercy; the next he would promise to rain fiery retribution upon their heads. He made outrageous demands, refused reasonable compromises, and required a new silk pillow to cushion his chair every morning. It was not long before the clan and family leaders began to despair. They had cowed the Virtue\u2019s army, but he had no intention of retreating. He did not believe he had been beaten.\nThen one morning the mother-witch of Kint, a bird-like old woman with thin white hair and one blue eye, had stepped forward to offer her city\u2019s terms for the Virtue\u2019s surrender. The cardinals had looked upon her delicate frame and patched clothes, and they had laughed. They had laughed with the snorting certainty of men who did not believe an old woman could harm them. They had laughed and ordered her taken away. They had laughed when she spoke her name, her title, her ancestry. They had laughed and laughed until the muddy ground opened beneath them and one cardinal vanished into a damp, crumbling pit, his screams cut away by a wet sucking sound. The laughter stopped, but the mother-witch did not.\nThe Virtue did not plead for the lives of his cardinals until eight more had died. Then, only then, was he willing to negotiate.\nThe wind turned again. The boughs of the ancestor trees scraped and rasped.\n\u201cBring him,\u201d Pareetha said. \u201cYou will hear our terms inside.\u201d\nOna nodded curtly and urged her horse up the road, toward the red carriage.\nSevi shifted her weight from one foot to another and ducked her chin into her fur collar.\n\u201cMefi told me the slickrock clans pelted them with clumps of dung,\u201d she said. She sniffled and rubbed at her pink nose. During the signing of the treaty, the slickrock elders had demonstrated their terms of surrender on a man who had been found wearing the hair of Sufa children in a braided sash. It had taken three days for his flesh and blood to turn entirely to stone, but less than half that long for him to stop screaming. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even lift their heads. They\u2019re afraid of being turned into piles of rubble.\u201d\n\u201cYou needn\u2019t wait with me,\u201d Pareetha said, not for the first time.\nSevi sniffled again. \u201cThey\u2019ll have to stop in the valley, won\u2019t they? I don\u2019t want them to stop here.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late for them to safely cross the second pass,\u201d Pareetha said.\nThe first snowflakes began to fall, whirling down from the low gray clouds in lazy spirals. Sevi held out her hand to catch one. \u201cWhat do we care if they\u2019re safe? Can\u2019t you make them keep going?\u201d\n\u201cI will not deny them a night in the ancestor\u2019s forest. I do not think they will linger much after dawn.\u201d\nSevi gave her a questioning look. \u201cBut you can\u2019t do anything. Can you?\u201d\nHer daughter\u2019s question\u2014asked not hopefully, but doubtfully\u2014struck Pareetha like a punch to the throat. Sevi had never known a time when her people were powerful.\nPareetha said nothing, and Sevi turned away. Her gaze skipped over the soldiers and settled on the carriage, where the captain had dismounted to approach the door. There had only been one awesome power in Sevi\u2019s young life, and he rode in that fire-warmed box while his army stumbled in the cold.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWith the agonizing slowness of empty ceremony, eight soldiers formed twin lines outside the red carriage, flanking its narrow door. They were empty-handed; some did not even have swords in their scabbards. They waited, shivering in their boots and threadbare uniforms, as the scant gray daylight bled from the valley. Pareetha had sent Sevi into the longhouse to alert the guards and warm herself, and she was beginning to wish she had gone as well. She could not feel her nose.\nSome time passed before the carriage door opened and smoke billowed out, obscuring a soft orange light. Pale hands emerged, grasping the shoulders of the closest soldiers. A short, slight man with papery-white skin and a shaved head stepped from the carriage onto the metal steps. A second man, nearly identical, followed.\nThe Virtue\u2019s cardinals all looked the same, no matter their age or land of origin. Pareetha had seen dozens of them over the years. She had even killed two, once, so long ago she had not yet known how long the invasion would last nor how many clans and tribes and towns would fall. When she had still believed they might drive the Virtue away before winter, before spring, surely before the end of summer. Helping with her deadly mission had been a pair of brothers, skilled witches from the western canyonlands. Both men had died.\nIt was not a fair price, the lives of two good men for the lives of two scuttling, sneering sycophants. When they died the cardinals had smelled of wine and piss and overripe plums.\nOutside the carriage, the old men unfolded a long length of red cloth and held it high above their heads. They waited. Their arms trembled. Snow escaped the gray sky, the flakes whisking sideways rather than collecting on the ground. The northern pass was shrouded in clouds. The army\u2019s ragged trailing end of carts and mules had cross the summit while Pareetha was not watching.\nFinally: the cardinals\u2019 arms straightened, the soldiers\u2019 attention sharpened, and a solitary figure emerged from the carriage. The red cloth hid him from view: Pareetha could see only the jutting peaks of a golden headpiece. The crown bobbled the cardinals shuffled along, their slippers scraping over gravel and stone, the red cloth snapping in the wind, with the eight soldiers behind them. The procession moved awkwardly down the road and up the path to the longhouse.\nPareetha waited with Ona until they had passed, then followed. They did not speak as they walked side by side to the longhouse. Ona glanced at Pareetha and her guards before stepping through the doorway. The cardinals had accompanied the Virtue into the warmth, but the eight soldiers remained outside in the cold.\nNoises came from within: low voices, the clatter of logs, the elegant swish of folding silk. Another stretch of time passed. The mountain twilight deepened. The sky was now the color of steel. Snow whirled on the restless wind.\n\u201cCome in,\u201d said a voice from inside. It was little more than a whisper, that voice, but the gray evening stilled to listen, the ice-edge snowflakes suspended a moment in the air. The wind itself trembled like a cowering hare for the space of a breath. \u201cCome in, come in. Join us.\u201d\nOne of Pareetha\u2019s guards huffed. \u201cYou need an invitation?\u201d\nPareetha gave the girl a quick smile and hoped it was reassuring. \u201cWait here. This won\u2019t take long.\u201d\nOne of the Virtue\u2019s soldiers, a boy, made a small, animal sound in his throat. A companion comforted him with a touch on the shoulder. Pareetha stepped into the longhouse before her smile turned to a grimace and frightened the children more. The warmth was sudden and startling; Sevi had added fresh wood to the fire. She stood now beside an empty stool, her expression anxious, her fingers twitching nervously at her sides.\nThe Virtue was seated on another stool in the center of the room. His two cardinals stood just behind him, their hands folded into their long sleeves. Ona stood by the hearth. Beneath the smoke, Pareetha smelled strong, flowery perfume over the sour stench of an invalid near death.\nShe sat on the empty stool and folded her hands in her lap and she thought: So. So, this frail, sickly creature was the conqueror of a hundred realms. Here was the nightmare who had swept through Sufa with bone-rattling speed. Here was the man who had set his eyes upon the lands of snow and ice, the savage lands, the witching lands, the mountains of whispers and death, the valleys of memory and blood, the realms where stone touches sky, untamed and unconquered since the beginning of time\u2014but he had not conquered them, and he had not tamed them, and his reign was over.\n\u201cGreetings, gentle mother,\u201d said the Virtue. He spoke in a high, whispering voice, like wind passing through an empty house. \u201cYou are kind to receive us.\u201d\nHe had aged decades in the three months since the Treaty of Kint. He was even shorter than he had been before, as though his bones were crumbling into themselves. His scalp was bare except for a few lonely white hairs, and the elaborate crown of glittering rubies and gold cut into his skin so deeply Pareetha wondered if he could remove it at all. His eyes were watery blue surrounded by jaundiced yellow. He had no eyebrows. His hands, resting on his knees, were so brittle the merest slap might shatter them.\n\u201cYou find me revolting,\u201d said the Virtue.\nPareetha looked at him, looked and did not flinch. She could see how his countenance might bear artifacts of long-faded beauty: sharp cheekbones, strong nose, lips curled into a pink pout. As a young man he would have glittered as he rode before his army and roused crowds with his speeches, gathering followers as a corpse gathers flies. He must have shone so bright it stung the eyes.\nPareetha said, \u201cI find a plague of boils revolting as it sweeps through a city.\u201d\nThe cardinals sneered and hissed.\n\u201cI find a blight revolting when it turns crops and trees to rot.\u201d\nThe Virtue laughed. A string of spittle dripped from his lips.\n\u201cI find a festering wound revolting when it leaks poison into the blood,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you, you are no more than a moth smashed beneath a thumb, easily brushed away.\u201d\n\u201cAh! Ah, gentle mother, I have tasted your pain before,\u201d the Virtue said. There was wonder in his sibilant voice, as though he did not quite know what to make of her words. \u201cI have tasted it from others like you and not like you. Has this been your home always?\u201d\n\u201cThis has always been my home,\u201d Pareetha said.\n\u201cIt is so very unlike what a home should be.\u201d The Virtue looked around the longhouse curiously, examining the rough wooden roof beams, the crumbling sod ceiling, the crooked fireplace, the dirt floor. \u201cDoes the wind howl so all the time? Do you burn the dung of your animals? I have heard that it is the favored fuel in barbaric places.\u201d\nPareetha did not answer.\nThe Virtue\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou would begrudge me even my curiosity, gentle mother. I come from a land very far from here. You do not know of it. It is a land so splendid the sun itself is envious of its glimmer. We have cities of golden towers. We have hills so rich and green the milkmaids grow as fat as their cattle. We have such wealth even the poorest beggar collects gold coins in his cap.\u201d The jewels on the cardinals\u2019 rings caught the firelight as they tittered. \u201cI have been very long from home. It is a beautiful land. You cannot imagine. You do not have a mind such as mine, that can know what others can never comprehend. I pity you for that. I could have gifted you a home like that. Such goodness, to save you from this cold, bleak place.\u201d\n\u201cWe do not need your pity,\u201d Pareetha said. \u201cAnd what you offered was neither gift nor goodness. We want nothing from you but your absence.\u201d\nWith a flash of anger, the Virtue\u2019s face was transformed. No longer was he an sickly old man, pale and spotted, but a creature of rage, loosely held together by skin as thin as mayfly husks, and pressing from behind where his bones ought to be there were instead the jagged corners of trembling anger. The red silks, the golden crown, the simpering cardinals, they were players on a traveling stage, pieces of an act performed to convince this sickly, pathetic, crumbling wreck of a man that he was still powerful.\n\u201cYou will beg for me to return,\u201d said the Virtue. \u201cYou do not know how great you can be. You will plead for my help. You are mere savages and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBe quiet,\u201d Pareetha said. The shock on his face gave her a perverse pleasure. \u201cYou are not here to bore us with your delusions. You are here to listen.\u201d\nThe Virtue\u2019s scowl was mulish, like that of a child called before his mother to tell-tale of his own misdeeds. \u201cI have heard the treaty a hundred times, woman. The dirt shall swallow me, my skin shall rot, an ugly crone will make my cock shrivel and drop off. Get on with it and let me be on my way.\u201d\nIt was what Pareetha had wanted for years. The Virtue before her, and a chance to speak. She could not make him hear the screams of those who had died on battlefields or the wails of orphaned children. She could not make him hear the wet wheeze of a last breath. The thump of a body falling to the ground, and another, and another, so many they became a drumbeat of horror in her nightmares. She did not have that power, but she had her voice, and she had intended to tell him of the wise women his soldiers had murdered, her mother and eight others, and the knowledge that had been lost. She had meant to rail at him, to thunder, to rage. She had imagined holding a knife to his throat, or a spear to his heart, until fear came into his weak, watery eyes. She would demand he acknowledge all he had destroyed. He would shrink into his robes, shamed and defeated.\nThose intentions had been a daydream born of summer storms, when every new term laid upon the Virtue by other villages and clans had been a thrill, but the thrill had grown hollow as the days had passed. Pareetha could not know what her mother and the wise women would have chosen, had they lived. She could not remember her mother\u2019s voice, and she was tired. She was tired of this man, tired of his silks, tired of his stench, tired of his petulance. She had been tired for twenty years. There was a knotty core in her center that had not slept since the first time the Gates of Ice had trembled beneath the boots of the Virtue\u2019s army and she had fled into the woods with blood on her face and screams in her ears. The ash of her burning village had never cleared from her eyes. She did not want to endure his presence one moment longer.\nPareetha stood. \u201cYou will leave now.\u201d\n\u201cWill I?\u201d the Virtue said, surprised but smiling. \u201cYou have drawn an old man from his warm carriage to be insulted and abused, and you do not even have your own terms to add to the treaty? Will you not threaten me with a witch-weaving of your own?\u201d\n\u201cYour terms are this,\u201d Pareetha said, speaking slowly to hide her cold rage. He had no right to speak of the magic he had taken from them. He had no right to breathe even a suggestion of her mother\u2019s great, lost power across his vile tongue. \u201cYour army may camp in the forest tonight, because your soldiers are weary and need rest. You have until midday tomorrow to cross the summit of the southern pass and leave the Gates of Ice and the lands of Sufa forever.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if I do not?\u201d\nShe had no threat for him, and he knew it. She wanted to claw the smile from his face.\n\u201cYou will,\u201d Pareetha said.\nShe turned and strode from the longhouse, Sevi right behind her.\nWhen they were several paces away, another set of footsteps followed. It was Ona. Both the Virtue\u2019s soldiers and Pareetha\u2019s guards watched warily as the women faced each other.\nOna said, \u201cYou need not our presence endure much longer.\u201d\n\u201cMidday tomorrow,\u201d Pareetha said.\nBut what she wanted to do was grab the other woman\u2019s shoulders and shake her until she rattled and ask: Was it worth it? Is this what you expected when you left your home to follow a liar and a thief? Have you glory enough to fill your belly and bring your friends back from the dead? So many among the Virtue\u2019s army had offered their fealty to him willingly, even as he conquered their lands, even as he slaughtered their families and neighbors. It was said their belief in his righteousness was fueled by madness and magic and a desolate fear of defeat that was stronger than both. So many had believed his promises of riches and safety, basked in his praise, reveled in the scraps of glory he offered like a butcher leaving entrails for street dogs. They were of an age, she and Ona, and she wanted know: Why? Why do you serve him? Why did so many have to suffer?\nThese were not questions on Pareetha\u2019s tongue but rust, brittle and bitter.\nOna was looking at her, waiting.\n\u201cIs it your home too, the city of golden towers?\u201d Pareetha asked.\nA long pause, then Ona said, \u201cIt will be our home. This the good one has promised.\u201d\nThe yearning in her voice was simple and painful. Even now, she believed the name he had given himself. Even now, she clung to the tapestries of triumph he wove and blinded herself to the lies rotten him from within. What would it take to make them see, Pareetha wondered, but it was not a question so much as a sigh. They had nothing but their belief in him. He had destroyed everything else.\nPareetha turned away. She walked with Sevi toward the village. The air smelled of roasting meat and woodsmoke and, for a moment, her stomach turned. She did not watch the Virtue\u2019s pantomime of ceremony as he returned to his carriage.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nShe rose from her pallet and dressed quietly in boots and furs. Sevi was a tangle of curly brown hair peeking from beneath the thick quilted blanket. Pareetha reached for her but did not touch. She let her daughter sleep and slipped outside. The village was quiet. The animals had been brought in for the night, the fires banked, the doors and shutters latched. A fire still glowed in the longhouse by the road. The guards emerged to see who was passing, then nodded and returned to the warmth.\nSpecks of light dotted the valley below. The campfires of the Virtue\u2019s army were made hazy and soft by the falling snow, winding through the forest like a snake made of stars.\nWhen the Virtue first came to the Gates, Pareetha had been a woman of twenty-three, with a good man for a husband, strong and respected parents, one child clinging to her otter-skin boots, another growing in her womb. By the time the army had crossed the northern pass and roiled into Sufa, she had nothing. Her father and husband and child were slaughtered. Her mother and the other wise women had been dragged to their deaths behind stomping, frenzied steeds. The packed dirt pathways of White Bear had been churned into a bloody quagmire. Pareetha\u2019s bare feet, when she fled, had tracked blood all the way down the hillside and into the ancestor forest below.\nShe followed that same path now. Her mouth filled with the metallic taste of fear, never forgotten. The sky had been black with smoke that day, and arrows and flames had chased at her back as she tumbled and tripped down the rocky mountainside. Her chest ached from ragged breaths drawn and released decades ago. She remembered, briefly, the flutter in her womb: the final kicks of a child who would be stillborn before the next day dawned.\nThe ground leveled. The creek calmed. Beneath the dusting of snow, tufts of moss replaced the tumbling stones beneath her feet, and the echoes of the long-ago massacre faded. A thick mist rose from the ground, twisting through the trees, meeting the snow as it fell. In the heart of the forest was the grove where the wise woman of the Gates had been buried for centuries. The trees were smaller but older, gnarled twisted and so close together their branches formed a canopy of braids.\nAt the grove\u2019s eastern edge were nine wise women in nine trees, and the last was her mother.\nPareetha\u2019s knees cracked as she sank to the ground. She remembered the scent of flesh boiling from bones, mingled with the acrid smoke of the smoldering village and the cruel, taunting promise of early spring. The rite should have taken days, but there had been so many to bury and so few left to bury them, and they had hurried. The tree\u2019s rugged black bark was pale with frost. In the crevice that split its trunk, her mother\u2019s skull was collecting soft snow in its eye sockets.\n\u201cI named her for you,\u201d she said finally. \u201cI haven\u2019t told her yet, but I think she knows.\u201d\nBe careful how you speak to the ancestors, her mother used to say, because they hear what you mean more than the words you choose. It had been a long time since Pareetha had believed the ancestors were listening.\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to be as tall as you were,\u201d Pareetha went on. \u201cShe\u2019s thirteen now.\u201d\nPareetha felt exhaustion in every limb, down to her bones. She felt herself sinking closer to the ground, her shoulders slumped, her head hanging. The skull\u2019s empty eyes were watching her.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what promise you would have laid upon him,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you would have chosen mercy or pain. If you would have made his blood turn to ice if he did not leave, or his heart turn to stone\u2014as though it isn\u2019t already. You might have asked the winter wind to scour the skin from his bones. I have imagined so many punishments, but I have no way to weave them. I cannot protect us. I cannot even make a threat that he won\u2019t dismiss with laughter.\u201d\nThe only answer was a whirl of mist and whisper of wind, and in it Pareetha heard not a promise of vengeance, but the gentlest scold. It was the scold of a mother, not a wise woman. A reminder that the Virtue may sneer at Pareetha\u2019s mountain home, he may revel in all he had taken from her and so many others, but he had not taken everything. She had a daughter who grew stronger and wiser every day. She had outlived the war that had taken parents, husbands, lovers, friends, children. She had food to fill her belly, furs to keep her warm, and strong walls to stop the wind. The people of Sufa had, in the end, triumphed. The invaders were leaving.\nShe did not understand the balance of loss and gain over the course of a woman\u2019s life, and she had no wise women to whom she could direct her questions. She still could not remember her mother\u2019s voice. She had, in this moment, only the quiet of the ancestor grove and winter\u2019s first snowfall, and in that quiet, in that peace, she breathed, and she listened.\nHer mother\u2019s skull was wholly hidden by snow now. The tree could have been any tree.\nWith a sigh, Pareetha rose to her feet, knees cracking once again. She brushed snow from her coat and from her gloves. She turned away. She was not going to enjoy the long climb back to White Bear. She would take the road rather than the creekside trail.\nWhen she came to the edge of the camp, she walked along the road until she found the Virtue\u2019s carriage. She only wanted to look upon it one more time, she told herself, but it was a feeble child\u2019s excuse behind a woman\u2019s dark impulse. Smoke still rose from the chimney. Snow dusted the pelts of its buffalo, resting in their harnesses, and the driver slept wrapped in a blanket on the bench. The only sign of motion was Ona, mounted upon her gray horse, plodding a quiet circuit around the carriage, down the line, back again.\nPareetha watched the woman make two full circuits. As she began the third, the horse balked suddenly, snorting and stomping at the frozen ground. The horse shied away from the edge of the road, and Pareetha\u2019s heart thumped. She stepped back, deeper into the shadows, then again. The mist had thickened while she was walking, but she had not noticed before now how densely it surrounded her, obscuring the trunks of the trees and wrapping the lowest branches in drifting, shifting shrouds. The wind had stopped. The snow fell lazily, without hurry. But the mist was restless with motion.\nFrom the corner of her eyes, Pareetha saw a figure form to her left, a silhouette in the mist that dissipated as quickly as it had appeared. She stopped breathing and her heart stuttered. Another figure swirled to her right, and another. She turned, and they both vanished.\nThe fog stilled, and began to sink. On the road Ona\u2019s horse steadied.\nPareetha faced forward again. Her heart thumped so powerfully she felt it in her ears, her neck, her fingertips. Her eyes burned from the cold and her refusal to blink. She did not let herself look to the left or the right. Her neck ached with the effort of holding still. Snow gathered on the ground. A soldier coughed. A log settled on a campfire.\nAnd finally, silently, the faceless figures returned. She did not look this time. She felt them as motion at the edge of her vision, as cold breaths of air at her back, featureless but for hints of what they had once been, always just out of sight. They crowded behind her. She was a line they would not cross.\nShe extended her hand to the side\u2014slowly, slowly, as she might reach for a fox caught in a snare. A cold touch caressed her fingers. She dare not look at it directly. She would never know if it was gnarled from years of spinning wool or calloused from chopping wood. It might have been chubby and soft and small and yearning for comfort she could not provide. It might have been any hand. It might have been a trick of the air and light.\nBe careful what you ask of the ancestors, her mother used to say. In Pareetha\u2019s thoughts her words were a whisper of pine needles trembling before a coming storm. Be careful, she had said, because they might answer.\nThere was a pain in the center of Pareetha\u2019s chest that tasted of laughter and tears. The cold slipped from her fingers. She closed her hand into a fist and pressed her knuckles to her mouth. A single sob escaped\u2014a gasp, nothing more\u2014and it was immediately echoed by a loud crack. It was the sound of wood breaking, loud enough to carry.\nBy the campfires, soldiers woke, startled by the noise. The buffalo snorted and stamped their hooves, waking their driver from his slumber. Heads turned; voices murmured. Nobody wanted to leave the warmth of the fire. They would have been telling stories of this wood as they made camp, if they had the strength for it. Ona\u2019s horse pranced and snorted. She soothed the startled beast, dismounted, and peered warily into the trees.\nPareetha held her breath, but Ona did not see her. She saw trees and mist, darkness and snow. She saw a forest like any forest, thick with fog, filling with snow, its ancient history hidden from her eyes. She did not belong here. She would not see anything else.\nAnd because her attention was on the forest, she did not see what was behind her.\nOn the side of the red carriage was the Virtue\u2019s seal, a white heart wreathed in a golden sun. Pareetha had watched it rumble down the road all afternoon. She had watched it blot out the sky for twenty years. But now, through the gently falling snow, the Virtue\u2019s seal was no longer an unbroken circle of paint.\nIt had been sliced through by long dark lines that reached and splayed like the branches of a tree.\nNo. A fresh well of laughter filled Pareetha\u2019s throat. No, those dark lines were the branches of a tree. They had split the side of the carriage; firelight shone through small cracks. In that scant yellow light, Pareentha could see that the branches were dotted with small fresh leaves, so delicate and pale they trembled in the restless air.\nThe door of the carriage slammed open. One of the cardinals stuck his head out and barked an order at Ona. The words were frantic, the language ugly, but Pareetha understood enough.\nSend for the camp physician, he said.\nThe Virtue was ill, he said.\nHe breathes, he said, but he won\u2019t wake.\nBefore Ona had even finished nodding, the cardinal vanished into the carriage and pulled the door shut. Ona pointed, and a young soldier raced to obey.\nPareetha pressed her fist to her lips again. She would cry. She would wail. She would yelp with joy. So many times she had imagined spilling the Virtue\u2019s blood. She had imagined wounds in his flesh, fear in his eyes, ice in his blood. She had imagined his skin turning waxy and pale with frostbite. If only she had her mother\u2019s power, she had told herself. If only the wise women had lived. If only their knowledge had not been lost. Twenty years of occupation and war, and Pareetha had never been able to imagine their power as anything but violence, its goals as anything but fear. She had been so certain, and so wrong. The laughter Pareetha had swallowed before threatened to burble up now, as hot and bitter as a mountain spring. She was a child again, giddy with all she did not know. The nine wise women were dead, their words lost, their voices silenced. But their blood had nourished this wood, and there was nothing, no army, no emperor, no violence, no invasion that could wash it away. The ancestors had been here all along, waiting for her to find a new way to hear them.\nThe camp physician hurried into the carriage. The guards were roused. It would not do to be caught lurking. Pareetha drew back into the shadows of the forest.\nThe Virtue still lived, but he would not wake. He was an old man. He had no successor or heir. He was defeated. He was ill. The knot of his power would fray with every mile the army marched. By the time they reached the golden city in its green hills\u2014if there was such a place\u2014his empire would be in shambles.\nPareetha could see it all as though it had already happened and her memories were fresh. She walked through the forest until the trees thinned and the canopy parted, and the wind stung her face, and the mountains loomed above her. A bank of clouds clung to the hanging valley where White Bear stood. The road, crooked and cold, would take her home. She began to climb.\nThe ancestors had chosen. Whether it was punishment or mercy was not for Pareetha to judge. Do not, her mother had once said, try to argue with them.\nFor the first time in years, her mother\u2019s voice was clear as starlight in Pareetha\u2019s memory.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue30\/3lbe30_story4.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"What remained of the Virtue\u2019s army marched into the Gates of Ice at sunset.

Still, he couldn\u2019t see himself as a suicide. He was possessed of too much morbid curiosity. Although he feared it, he wanted to know what happened tomorrow.\nAn occasional glimpse of his future self in the mirror filled him with dread. He was the author of his own history. What people called progress seemed an accretion of inept decisions. Even those who once knew everything had lost control. The powerless could only hope to avoid the maximum amount of pain.\nDespite his claustrophobia he refused to venture outside. He could not tolerate that effusive stench of grief.\nThe sudden drop in temperature should have brought relief but it made him fearful of his lack of preparations. The change in seasons wasn\u2019t unexpected\u2014in fact, it was long overdue\u2014but it had lost its comforting predictability. Although he welcomed the cold, its abrupt arrival still felt unnecessarily cruel.\nThe house was plagued by myriad drafts. He\u2019d put off necessary repairs for years. Now he spent hours each day tracking down leaks, filling cracks with plaster or putty and holes with wadded up rags, but some he never found, and these multiplied, small pockets of intense cold running across his feet, up his legs, and around his neck, their bites turning his flesh numb.\nDesperate for some protection, a warm coat, a heavy sweater, a simple, fuzzy scarf, he made his annual trek to the back of the house, where the winter closet lay sleeping, behind its heavy door.\nThere was no direct passage. Whoever designed this archaic residence must have believed advancement needed to be earned. He maneuvered his way around crowded rooms and edged along shabby galleries, negotiated stairs both up and down, past staggered photo arrays of the dead and the missing, navigated around the piles of thoughtless accumulation assembled at frequent points along the way, gathered over a lifetime, because he\u2019d always been afraid to travel into the future with too little. He\u2019d cultivated a bad habit of clinging to what was meant to be temporary but purchasing a quantity of ephemera at least provided a way to fill the time.\nSeveral rooms he could not enter because they were overly full. Others featured goat trails bleeding between towering, precarious geometries. He could not manage these narrow paths without triggering frequent collapse, generating movements which rippled throughout the house for hours.\nBy the time he reached the massive closet door he barely had the strength to open it. His arthritic fingers could scarcely grip the knob. His arms shook as he dragged the heavy wood against the gritty floor. The shriek it made recalled someone\u2019s final, humbling pain.\nThe initial smell carried a hint of grave. Coats, sweaters, and jackets hung on both sides with a narrow aisle in between. Stacked high on shelves were the scarves and hats, with gloves and muffs piled beneath dust and cobwebs so thick he was loath to touch them. On the floor the extensive collection of old boots lay scattered like the remains of some careless slaughter.\nFew of the garments had been his. They were the hand-me-downs of generations, of children, adults, dead, misplaced, or estranged, all that was left of a family he could not let go, but which had drifted away from him anyway.\nThe winter closet was so deep he could not see its end. There was no interior light. He had to rely on the dim bulb hanging in the hall.\nThe first few feet consisted of children\u2019s snow suits: vivid swollen torsos and arms with extraneous padding. His children who\u2019d worn them had resembled dyed snowballs. He couldn\u2019t remember who had owned what, not that it mattered. He imagined they would tell him if they visited.\nHis late wife\u2019s coats were soft and woolly or shiny like her, and two or three, improbably, still held her fragrance from back when she was well and they all took better care. He resisted the urge to try them on. He understood the dangers of lingering here, and plunged forward, back into the years when he was a boy, and all the years before.\nHe\u2019d expected it to be warm in here, a cozy adventure surrounded by furs and flannels, leathers and fleece, the intense fabrics of the departed. What he discovered instead was a deeper concentration of cold.\nStuck between the outfits and shoved to the walls were the not-clothes, the antique skis, the mops and brooms, the broken toys, the lop-sided stacks of tattered books printed in languages he did not recognize. The closet walls themselves were papered with stained and yellowing maps, a tangle of routes highlighted, annotated, or crossed out.\nSubsequent outer garments were greasy, and bits of fiber and lining and glue came off and stuck to his hands. The next strata smelled so intensely of smoke and fire he fought to breathe.\nThe last few coats still had arms inside their sleeves. He struggled to push his way past hanging carcasses, shrouded in stylish winter fashions and the stench of meat, their collegiate scarves wrapped around missing heads.\nHe kept pushing, even though he worried what he might discover on the other side. His bones had turned brittle, and his skin had become painful to touch. He was terrified of the possibility of frostbite and needed something warm to force himself into. Anything remaining would have to do.\nAs his hand punctured the final thinness of wall, a carbon black film tearing and disintegrating, he fell the rest of the way through, and realized he\u2019d pushed his endeavor too far. Everything dropped and curled into nothing, and he stood alone on the ash-covered, tortured ground.\nHere was a landscape evading recognition, and yet he knew every inch. Upheavals of concrete and earth adorned with the abstract markings of soot and rust, asphalt vomitus and a spray of metal renderings, plastic dust, and drifts of toxic vapor. In the distance, remnants of blackened trees sprawled as if executed.\nSo many people lived hoping for the good that might someday come. Religions and governments had been built using this hope as currency.\nRandom drips of movement made him blink. He blinked again as these accidental gestures resolved into animated shapes of annealed flesh poking from the wreckage, their humanity recognizable, although he suspected these empathetic faces had been baked, or painted on, and in fact they were too self-involved with their own hopeless solitude to notice him.\nAt least they could not communicate, so he didn\u2019t have to listen to their pain. He tried to examine his own flesh, but his brain would not allow it. Everything he\u2019d ever cared for lay somewhere beyond his reach.\nAll good intentions were no longer relevant. Here even his skin did not fit.\nIt was a winter of painful colors and the coldest days on record.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue36\/3lbe36_story3.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"It was a summer of painful colors and the hottest days on record.

Crowded. Noisy. Sales everywhere. Retailers were sweating. The summer had been bad. A lot of people, like Joe Horn, had next to no money.\nUnlike those to whom appearance was all, he looked like it. Surplus fatigue pants and a field jacket, both well worn. Which is to say, ragged. Good quality running shoes, though. Major budget item.\nA family went by. Mom with shades perched on frosted hair, Dad looking comfortably rumpled in dockers and deck shoes. Two kids, girl in a stroller, boy toddling.\nMom was intent on bargains. Dad sighed. Toddler had to go to the baffroom. Made the elusive th into ff and then ffff, a spray of spittle. Giggled at his own rapier wit.\nMom pointed, issuing directives to Dad, who did the sigh thing again. Mom and the stroller arced into Ms. Professional.\nDad picked up the toddler and headed for the baffroom. Had a bit more lift in his step, maybe thinking of a detour to Sears, spend a few minutes ogling a voluptuous bandsaw.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHorn turned to the sports section: Atlanta came from behind, beat the Pirates in the tenth, evened the playoffs.\nFound him yesterday. The Woman. Sarah Fenton, reporter doing a story on the homeless. Nice hair, short and thick. Moved like a dancer. His puerile mind invented means of disrobing her. But he had other things to do.\nPeople were dying.\nAnd who are you, Horn, the Great Avenger?\nYeah, well, somebody\u2019s gotta do it.\nBut he didn\u2019t need a reporter getting into this. So he mumbled about God\u2019s Wrath On Heathen Puppies, and she grimaced and made a few notes and went away.\nKind of a shame. Nice body.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSarah dodged right and left through the crowd, Gayle Sayers in his prime. Sato would have liked the way she moved. He had always valued fluidity over power.\nGood old Sato. Had run a little dojo in the mountains, in Japan. Very pristine. Very beautiful. Very rugged. Very fucking cold at night.\nHorn had spent a few nights outside, up there at eight thousand feet, watching for the furtive movement, listening for the delicate step. Screaming obscenities as Sato inevitably caught him napping, and beat the shit out of him with The Stick.\nOne night, a long time ago, in a scummy bog in Vietnam, a hideous stick figure rose out of the black water and ate seven men. Their screams still haunted him, twenty years after the fact. Even though they had been about to kill him.\nSato taught Horn how to control his fear. Mostly fear of Sato, hiding behind trees and bushes, waiting with The Stick.\nHorn hated The Fucking Stick.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSarah swooped in, took the seat across from him. Let out a sigh. Pulled out her notebook. Brushed a bang out of her big green eyes. Clicked the pen. \u201cI talked to a man who says you blew up a bar in Texas.\u201d\nWhat an opening. \u201cReally.\u201d Turning the page.\nShe nodded briskly, checking items off. \u201cYep. Then there was the truck stop in Nevada. And\u2026\u201d pause as she confirmed careful research, \u201c\u2026a warehouse in Seattle.\u201d\nHe grimaced inwardly.

What\u2019s it to you?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s my job to ask questions.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s your job to get your facts right, too.\u201d\n\u201cI want to talk to you about these places \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a travel agent down at the other end.\u201d\n\u201cQuit being so goddamn glib,\u201d she said with a slightly disgusted air. \u201cAnd I note you\u2019re not giving me the street corner weirdo routine this time. I think you\u2019re a scam artist.\u201d\nHoping to get a rise out of him, he supposed. \u201cWhy? Looking to buy a bridge?\u201d\n\u201cLooking for answers.\u201d\n\u201cI'm a busy man. Places to go, people to meet. Make an appointment with my secretary.\u201d He dropped the paper on the table, got up and headed for the Wherehouse.\nShe tried to follow, obnoxious didn\u2019t describe it, but some group named Smashing Onions or something like that had a new album out and he lost her in the frantic crowd.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nGolden arches. Bought a pile of hamburgers. Stopped at KFC, picked up a bucket of chicken.\nHarbor Drive. The warehouse district, still resisting the wrecking ball.\nBooger, Cruiser, Fat Freddy and some others were huddled around a barrel in the railyard, burning garbage to keep away the dampness.\nHorn would have been welcome without the food, but it pays to look out for your friends.\nThey lived in the shadows, shuffling along Main Street by day, curling up on oily gravel at night. Dying by the knife, gun, drugs, booze, and rain. And once in a while, something else.\nFat Freddy scarfed down a drumstick and biscuit, spat a piece of gristle into the oily yellow flames. \u201cLady\u2019s been askin' 'bout you, Joe.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I met her.\u201d Chewing thoughtfully on a Big Mac. \u201cYou give her my name?\u201d\nFreddy laughed loud. \u201cShit, man, you think I'd give a white boy\u2019s name to a woman with tits like that?\u201d\nThe others laughed too, a big, bad sound.\nJoe smiled. But he didn\u2019t want anyone messing in his life. The world was fucked up. He was fucked up. Leave it alone.\nNobody else spoke for a while, except old Elmore, who muttered under his breath and shuffled his feet and wouldn\u2019t eat.\nFire crackled in the barrel, throwing gloomy shadows, defining the limit of their existence.\nJoe listened while they talked, of places seen, jobs held, then lost, the old lady kicked me out, assholes in government who let people live this way, best dumpster to scrounge this week (Italian restaurant on Sixth).\nElmore sneezed and pulled at his ragged coat.\nJoe thought the morning paper might have something. He had a sense about these things. Sato said it was ki.You get a bad feeling and don\u2019t get on the plane that crashes and kills everyone, it\u2019s your ki working.\nSo how come I haven\u2019t won the lotto?\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMetro: Man and his two year-old son, missing since yesterday, from the Harborside Mall.\nHe stood there for a couple of minutes, just holding the paper, and saying Shit, very softly under his breath, about a hundred times.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nA two year-old kid, with his dad. The biggest, strongest, smartest, best person in the whole world. Should have been a car on the street. Disease of the week.\nSomething normal, understandable. Not a spider-thing in the corner.\nMaybe it wasn\u2019t the spider thing, the muck drippy thing that he'd been running from for a long, long time, the thing that occasionally came out of the corner, dropped in for a bite to eat. Maybe dad had a girlfriend. Maybe he decided to take the kid and split, go meet the sweet young thing in the parking lot, pile into her Firebird and lay a patch toward Houston.\nMaybe. But probably not.\nSo how did he know? Sato once told him, when you go with your gut, it takes you to the refrigerator; when you go with your ki, it takes you to the answer.\nAnd then, wouldn\u2019t you know, Sarah suddenly appeared. Like the Cheshire Cat, grinning. \u201cHi.\u201d\nHe sighed.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a pattern,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople died in those places. Badly. Then you blew them up. Like that warehouse. Turns out to be old government storage. Supposedly it was office furniture. I\u2019ll bet. What was it, really? Were they storing nerve gas that leaked? Nuclear waste? I smell political cover-up.\u201d\n\u201cYou smell Pulitzer. Jesus, I could be an ax murderer. Don\u2019t they teach you any common sense?\u201d He shook his head, then had a sudden inspiration. \u201cIt was Muck Drippy Thing.\u201d This might be better than the Heathen Puppies line.\nShe blinked.\nHorn explained. \u201cA monster I know. Or maybe one of his friends. Slimy guys who eat people. Slavering fangs in the dark. Kind of like right wing male chauvinist war mongering industrialist pigs. They\u2019re not politically correct, so they tend to keep a low profile.\u201d\nShe blinked again. \u201cNo kidding.\u201d\n\u201cI never kid about politics.\u201d He left her there, and went down the corridor, attempting simultaneously to ignore her obtuseness and the cold ball in his gut.\nLooking around, he felt like a fool. Don\u2019t mind me, I'm the building inspector.\nA woman came out, looked askance. There\u2019s your monster, officer. Probably cut up that man and his little boy right here, flushed them down the john.\nFuck it. Went in. Had to piss anyway.\nToilet paper spilled out beneath a stall. Dirty water pooled around the floor drain.\nNobody here. But a guy in jeans and a sweater, one running shoe down by the heel, had come in here, about twenty minutes ago. He hadn\u2019t come out. There were no other exits. So where did he go?\nHorn looked around, disgusted. Then he got that feeling again. Jesus, why me?\nHe looked around. The running shoe was in the trash can. It was bloody. Like the water in the drain.\nThat was all. Well, it was enough.\nThe cold shivers went up and down his spine. His gut rolled over. And he felt the Big Silence.\nLike in the movies, when the viewer figures out what\u2019s about to happen, just before the character who\u2019s about to get eaten. About now the creepy music would start.\nThe feeling changed a little. Now it was a little more intense, a little more urgent.\nGET OUT.\nNot subtle, either.\nGET OUT.\nHe thought he heard something. Maybe a slight, very slight, gurgling sound. Like water way down in a drain pipe.\nThe water on the floor, the bloody water, had drained away. As though it had been sucked down.\nHe hung the \u201cOut Of Order\u201d sign on the door, armed the bomb, and got lost.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nShe dogged him up Fifth to Ash, slogging uphill past the massive high rises and sweating in spite of the chill off the bay. Fog obscured the tops of the buildings.\n\u201cWhere the hell have you been?\u201d She sounded exasperated. When Horn got lost, he got lost.\n\u201cMiss me?\u201d Sipping on a Diet Coke With Caffeine.\n\u201cYou did it again.\u201d\n\u201cDid what?\u201d\n\u201cBlew up the bathroom.\u201d\nTook another long pull. Belched grossly, but she ignored it. \u201cMessing up your facts again. I never did a bathroom before. And I didn\u2019t blow it up. There was no explosion. It\u2019s a small thermite charge and homemade napalm. Kind of poofs and then burns real hot.\u201d\nShe wasn\u2019t taking notes this time. \u201cI ought to turn you in.\u201d\nHe stuffed the empty can in a large pocket. Remember to recycle. \u201cRead your own paper? Man missing since Monday. Third case in a month.\u201d\n\u201cIt was a little half paragraph filler on page four of the Metro section. Big deal. So?\u201d\n\u201cI saw him go into that bathroom. He didn\u2019t come out. Same with that other guy, with his kid. Now no one else can go in and not come out.\u201d His voice hid something angry and sad, as his eyes roamed the dark. \u201cAnd I suspect that the families of those people might think it was a pretty big deal, in spite of what you say.\u201d\nShe was silent for three paces. In memoriam, he supposed.\n\u201cSo how does blowing up the bathroom solve the problem, assuming you aren\u2019t just destroying evidence of your own guilt?\u201d\n\u201cI found out that it messes something up, somehow, even if the structure is repaired. Like putting a garden hose down a gopher hole. You don\u2019t always get the gopher, but he doesn\u2019t want to live there anymore.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cWhy the interest? You\u2019ve already heard enough from other people to think I'm a loon, which is the usual opinion about the so-called disenfranchised. And it doesn\u2019t have a lot to do with your story.\u201d\nShe hesitated. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what the story\u2019s about. Maybe it\u2019s changed. What are you doing out here?\u201d\nStill scanning. \u201cTalking to a nosy reporter. Sorry, that\u2019s redundant.\u201d Looked at her again. Spoke slowly and clearly. \u201cRead my lips: Homeless.\u201d\n\u201cWhere do you sleep?\u201d\n\u201cOutside. Is that an offer?\u201d Saw two men on the other side of the street. One waved. He waved back, one hand in his pocket.\n\u201cIn your dreams. That crazy old guy, Elmore, says you don\u2019t sleep, you just walk the streets like 'the ghost o' lonely'.\u201d She sounded skeptical.\nHe shook his head. \u201cGood old Elmore.\u201d Always watching the shadows.\nTurned left on Laurel. Passed stately Gothic restorations, offices for doctors and lawyers. Their windows were dark eyes. No healing there, no defense against death.\nShe was catching his mood. \u201cWhat are you afraid of, Joe?\u201d\n\u201cDark stairs,\u201d he said, skirting an alley. \u201cDying in my sleep.\u201d Turned right at Twelfth. \u201cHaven\u2019t you got it yet? I'm paranoid. Delusional.\u201d\nShe persevered. \u201cWhen you came out of there your face was white. Like you'd just seen Death.\u201d\n\u201cPadres blew the playoffs. What can I say?\u201d\nShe stuck with him, apparently unable to plumb the depths of his wit.\nHe stopped at Wong\u2019s All Night Chinese Take-out. It was crowded at one in the morning. \u201cTry the Kung Pau Chicken.\u201d He bought.\nShe stood in front of him, turned to speak. The sweater was v-necked, presenting nice cleavage. \u201cYou act pretty flush for a derelict.\u201d\nHe leered salaciously. \u201cLow overhead.\u201d\nShe graciously admitted the food was good. A man peeled off from the crowd and joined them. He looked like a trash collector.\nJoe smiled. \u201cOne of my legitimate friends. Mac, meet Sarah the Newshound. This is Mac. He does dirty work at night.\u201d\nMac was forty-five, bulky and balding, with dirt under his fingernails and grease on his pants. \u201cCity Maintenance,\u201d he said, like Joe Friday would say his beat was Homicide. Grimaced as he spread blueprints on the table, forcing Sarah to rescue her chicken.\nHe talked about plumbing in the Harborside Mall, and turned the pages with elaborate care. His thick fingers mangled the paper. He traced pipes and drains, from the top to the street, rumbling like a 45 on 33 1\/3.\nSarah looked bored, like she was trying to figure the human angle on this refugee from the dusty back room of life.\nJoe was absorbed. Things were starting to make sense. In a hideous way. He bought a round of coffee, and studied the prints.\nMac held his styrofoam cup in both hands, slurping noisily, and tried not to appear to examine Sarah\u2019s chest.\nJoe thanked him, passed a couple of bills over the table. Mac grunted, but looked pleased. A professional doing what he did best. He gathered up his pile of paper and left, moving deliberately into the night.\nSarah grimaced. \u201cThat\u2019s what you call a legitimate friend?\u201d\nJoe watched him go. \u201cMac doesn\u2019t live like you. He works the night shift. Gets drunk on Thunderbird about once a week. Somebody finds him in an alley, takes him home. A room in the State Hotel. That\u2019s his life. He doesn\u2019t get to meet cute chicks very often.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Then, \u201cSo, what was that about?\u201d\n\u201cBasic research.\u201d He stared out the window, not liking the feeling he was getting.\nShe snorted with exasperation. Her eyes narrowed. \u201cThis strong, silent macho crap is starting to get on my nerves. Are you for real? You sound like a whacked out Clint Eastwood. You\u2019re so drawn and ragged, you kind of look like Clint Eastwood. On a very bad day.\u201d\nNo answer.\nMac stopped at an alley and looked in. The fog hung low and still, and partly obscured the view. And just like that, he disappeared. Papers scattered in the damp air.\nJoe could have said he wasn\u2019t sure, maybe Mac stepped in there to take a piss, that would be his style.\nSure.\nHe was out the door, digging into his pocket. He ran past the X-rated bookstore, the dusty appliance repair place, the Mexican restaurant smelling of chili and refried beans. Stopped short of the alley, flattened against the wall, soda can in one hand, hoping like hell a black-and-white didn\u2019t pick this moment to cruise by, with him standing there waving a piece of illegal ordnance. Hoping it would.\nHe listened.\nNothing.\nSo he went in there.\nBrick wall on one hand, eight-foot wooden fence on the other. Garbage cans and crates and no lights. Darkness was total. He went quietly, like Sato taught him. A drifting shadow in a trough of ink.\nHe heard a wet, slithering sound, and froze, terror clawing at his throat. Without conscious thought, he sank into his hara, the center of his soul. In his mind he plunged into a pool, like a spear, shot down into the cool depths, water lying placid above. He felt nothing, he was nothing. Less than a shadow, than the thought of death. He was not there at all.\nSilence.\nPlop The sound of gravel, crunched. Something oozing.\nTerrible eyes, searching.\nIt reached out.\nCloser.\nHorn sat quietly within himself.\nGroping. Testing. Hesitating. Then it receded.\nSilence.\nHorn came back, a step at a time.\nSilence.\nHe moved forward, quieter than before, nerves humming like banjo strings, run into a fly and he'd be in the next county, what the Hell was he doing here?\nHe sensed the copper smell of death. Alarms started going off, GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT \u2014\n\u201cJoe, what the hel \u2014 \u201c Fifty feet behind him, but it was like someone banging a pot in his ear.\nHe took off like a shot, heard It coming, pulled the tab and dropped the soda can, caught her with his shoulder below the ribcage. She whuffed in terror and surprise.\nThe can went off behind him, intense heat and a very bright flash, big WHUMP. Carried her out of there at a dead run, across the street, collapsed on the sidewalk.\nShe tried to scream at him, probably obscenities, but it came out a tortured groan. She was bent and wheezing, blinking from the flash. If looks could kill he'd have been a pile of cinders.\nHe got out a flashlight.\nThey waited.\nHe was not keen on going back. No, not at all. But he had to. For Mac.\nNo fire. The alley was dank, and the detonation hadn\u2019t been complete. Have to be more careful about the mix.\nOne minute. A car went by.\nSarah decided silence was golden, or less painful. She wheezed quietly.\nAnother minute.\nHe went back.\nSarah followed, huffing.\nTerror rose like bile. Sato said that\u2019s one reason we have ki, gives us strength to carry on. Sato got on his nerves sometimes.\nScraps of bloody clothing.\nSarah backed up, eyes wide, hand to mouth as though that would stop the rising sound.\nHorn expected a shriek, but it was worse somehow, for being a low moan.\nThe flashlight hung limp in Horn\u2019s hand, illuminating a storm grate. A bubble of gas belched out of it, rotten smell, putrescent images of green-black slime and crawling things.\nThey got out of there, fast.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThey caught a bus downtown. Neither spoke.\nThe bus shuddered and lurched down Sixth, along the park, growling like a huge bear. An old man slumped against a window, wheeze-snore, sleeping something off.\nSarah rocked against Horn, nodding. Terror does that. The body survived, now it had to rest, get ready for the next time. He put his arm around her.\nAt Broadway, she woke with a start.\nHorn unwrapped himself.\nShe sat up and rubbed her eyes, groggy. Then she remembered, and moved close, shivering.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nRaised eyebrow, Belmondo style, archly skeptical. Lost on her; too young to remember Belmondo.\nShe sensed it anyway. \u201cReally. I was fat, with bad teeth and stringy hair. The only party I ever went to at college, I found out it was a dog party. Bring the ugliest girl you can find. The story of my life.\u201d\n\u201cLooks like you got even.\u201d\nShook her head. \u201cNobody gets even. I just changed. Lost weight, got my teeth straightened. Cut my hair. And got mean.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem like a nice person.\u201d\nSnort. \u201cWhen pigs fly.\u201d\nPause.\n\u201cSo, why don\u2019t you have a home?\u201d\nHard to explain. Being over there. Seeing the little shacks, the hopeless stares, the children who carried guns and grenades. The smell of napalmed flesh.\nThe attitude when he came back.\nThe things he thought he'd left behind. But hadn't.\n\u201cI kept breaking the windows.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHorn couldn\u2019t figure how he could weigh three hundred pounds on what he ate.\n\u201cHelluva woman, Joe.\u201d\nHorn nodded, strolling with his hands in his pockets, fingers wrapped around a soda can, from habit.\n\u201cYou been lookin' for somethin' a long time, boy. Maybe you foun' it.\u201d Freddy, who had an MBA from Stanford, let his Alabama roots show when he was thinking deeply.\nHorn listened. Sato had taught him respect for wise men.\n\u201cSometimes, you think you fin' it, like you do that thing in Sea-tall. But nobody lay it on wit' Death like that, an' call it a livin'. Mebbe time to come in from th' col'.\u201d\nHorn was silent for a block. He wasn\u2019t surprised that Freddy knew about Seattle.\nBooger panhandled the corner at State, looking bent and awkward. Wore the frayed Padre jacket, like always. Having an okay day. Seven bucks and change.\nSaw Cruiser in the square, leaning on his shopping cart, petting his little mutt, Jake.\nSomebody they didn\u2019t know was preaching on the corner.\nLate morning crowds swirled around them. Freddy breached the waves. Horn trailed in the eddy of his passage.\nHelluva woman.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHe perched on a siding and sipped warm beer.\nElmore wandered by. Sat. Hawked and spat. Reeked like nothing Horn knew.\nHorn offered him the beer.\nElmore drew back. \u201cFish don\u2019t sleep.\u201d\nHorn nodded, finished the beer.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHe tore the robe off her.\nShe dragged him down.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nLater, he watched her sleep. Stroked her damp hair. He liked the feel of it, damp and silky. Made her seem vulnerable. He was a sucker for that.\nThought about staying.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHe stood by the door, still needing a shave. Yes, he supposed that was what he was doing.\nHer eyes were flinty. \u201cCome when you please, go when you please. Pretty cavalier with your relationships.\u201d She sat up, and the covers pooled around her waist. Her hair was nicely tousled. He could smell her musk. The strength of his reaction to it frightened him.\nHe wanted to say something stupid. Like, I love you. That was what scared him most, he realized. He wanted to stay, and he knew better than that. Never stay, Horn. Never.\nAnd there was an air about her, just a little, of artifice. The alluring image of the nymph, bed-ready, clashed with the hard eyes.\nBut he had a feeling she really didn\u2019t want him to stay. She'd been left before. Her eyes said it, the tone of her voice. Somewhere, sometime, she'd learned to like being treated like a whore. And part of the pleasure was giving back some of the pain.\n\u201cI don\u2019t sleep very well anymore,\u201d he said.\n\u201cApparently not. And a man\u2019s gotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do.\u201d Her voice was flat.\nBut it was a simple truth. He didn\u2019t sleep well anymore. He didn\u2019t sleep at all. And he did have something to do. \u201cStay away from storm drains,\u201d he said, opening the door.\n\u201cGo get 'em, Clint.\u201d Her eyes seemed old as he left.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nLike my heart, thought Horn, feeling a touch melodramatic.\nElmore stood in shadow, scratching himself. He mumbled something about Fat\nFreddy in the belly of the night. Something about the way he said it sent a chill up Horn\u2019s back.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHorn cruised Broadway. Booger wasn\u2019t there. Or Cruiser.\nChecked in at the downtown clinic, the plasma center, the soup kitchen. Zip.\nAlleys, dumpsters, empty lots. Nothing.\nSquad car slowed, gave him a once over. They knew him, he was clean, never pissed in doorways, slept at bus stops, or lurched down the middle of Union mumbling obscenities. So they went their way.\nHe thought about the blueprints, and Mac.\nIt knew. It didn\u2019t look over his shoulder and read the arcane plumber\u2019s language, or eavesdrop on the meandering conversation. But it knew.\nLike Horn sometimes knew things. Sato\u2019s training had been hard and relentless, and very effective. Primal instinct, honed by primal fear. Horn let it guide him now, like a divining rod.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBloodstained. Next to a storm drain.\nCruiser\u2019s shopping cart at Market and Fifth. Covered with scum, flies swarming in the long shadows.\nBooger\u2019s baseball jacket. Crawling with maggots. One ragged arm trailing from a half open manhole.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHorn smelled the damp, rank air off the bay. The pier was empty, except for a dumpster.\nStorm drain dumped out here.\nHe waited, hand in pocket, soda can warm and heavy. K-Bar strapped to his forearm. He'd had experience with these things.\nIt knew he was here. It was waiting. It ate all the big bad laughter. It left a trail to follow, mocking.\nHe waited.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cJoe!\u201d Breathless, husky voice.\nHe had an instant tactile memory of her on the floor under him. Made him hard in a second. A woman like that, walking the waterfront at four in the morning, must have balls the size of cantaloupes. He sighed. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\nShe tossed her head, to get a bang out of her big green eyes. \u201cI can read plans, too, smart ass.\u201d\nThat wasn\u2019t what he meant, and she knew it.\nHe looked around, force of habit, and sensed movement again. Pulled her close and they flattened themselves against the dumpster.\nCame a shuffling step, irregular, alien, but somehow familiar. A shape materialized.\nBent figure, oblivious to the night and the fog. Elmore.\nHorn stared, speechless. Then said, \u201cWhat the hell \u2014 \u201d\nElmore stopped and turned and looked at him with that ungodly Elmore stare.\nDidn\u2019t say anything, just tugged at the edges of the ragged, greasy raincoat, eyes bulging like he was suddenly frightened.\nTerrible eyes.\nAt the best of times, Elmore was not all there. This was not the best of times.\nTerrible eyes. Holding Horn, beckoning him, pulling him down into black, turgid depths. Arms reaching, slow, sinuous, snake like, mouth opening, opening, opening, until it was the universe turned inside out, the underside of everything exposed, a black hole sucking in the world, shockingly soft tentacles wrapping him up, tenderly, dragging him into the warm embrace of a dark and slimy ending\u2026\nHer voice brought him back, screaming like a goddammned banshee, what a pair of lungs, and he moved, automatically shifting into the high gear of controlled terror, it had always impressed the hell out of Sato, the k-bar jumping into his hand, slashing, pulling free, groping for the can, finding it, losing it as the tentacles came back, he was a goddamn hydra, they went for Sarah and he threw himself between them, and they got him again and pulled him in and he glimpsed her, eyes wide and empty, as cold as the bottom of a grave.\nShe threw the soda can as he was dragged into Elmore\u2019s scummy mouth.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nOn the pier, a few pieces of something still popped and sizzled, like burgers on a griddle. A uniformed cop stood by with a Purple K bottle. An empty one lay at his feet.\nThe dumpster was a ragged mess, blackened, torn metal and smoldering garbage.\nA plain clothes man straightened from inspecting blackened concrete, blew out a sigh. Forensics might make something out of the scraps, but unless they found a skull, with a few teeth that had been drilled, there was no way they could ID this one. He shook his head, waved at the man with the extinguisher. \u201cLet\u2019s get the hell out of here.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHe groaned.\nShe muttered an epithet. \u201cJesus, you stink. You\u2019re dripping scum all over my car. And you still need a bath.\u201d She didn\u2019t look a lot better. Her clothes were torn, and she had cuts and abrasions, but she hadn\u2019t taken a thermite bomb in the gut.\nThe jacket was a mess. The cloth was gone, only a few charred pieces still attached to the kevlar lining, which was what had saved him.\nShe made him get out of it, and threw it in a dumpster.\nHorn said nothing, laying back and breathing through clenched teeth while she strapped him in. The soda can was supposed to be mainly heat, not much bang, but he'd mixed it wrong again, and the explosion had thrown him into the bay. He was alive, but it felt regrettable.\nShe drove to Mercy General. Talked along the way, calm and rational, holding something down. Her hands barely shook on the wheel. \u201cI had to know. That\u2019s all. I just wanted to know. I was tired of not knowing.\u201d\nReporters, he thought, saying nothing. Thinking.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThey sewed him up, patched the worst holes, and let him go. Nothing they could do about it. Four ribs broken. Separated shoulder (hit the edge of the pier going in). Flash burns on his face. God-awful hole in his leg where Elmore had clamped on with a sucker or something.\nThe duty doc called it in, but by the time the cops came by Horn would be long gone.\nSarah waited on the street. \u201cWell?\u201d\nHe winced. The ribs were a problem. He took short breaths. \u201cYou see how it is.\u201d\nHer eyes wavered, momentarily limpid, yearning. Then the flint was shoveled into place. \u201cYes.\u201d\nHe hopped a bus downtown. She followed. They rode in silence.\nHe got off and started walking. Limping. Headed west, then stopped at the entrance to an alley he knew.\nThought he saw something move, in the shadowed recesses in the back. Just an impression. Something anyone else would have dismissed, if they had even noticed.\nSensitive, Horn was. Very sensitive.\nHe limped on. Checked another alley. Looked okay. Went in. Still thinking.\nSarah followed, ever inquisitive.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t figure out Elmore,\u201d he said half to himself, \u201cbecause Elmore wasn\u2019t MD.\u201d\nSarah was looking at him like he was crazy, in a sad way.\n\u201cI'm kind of sensitive to MD and his type, the real bad-ass monsters. Elmore was just one of the store-bought, Campbell\u2019s Soup variety. MD would have eaten him for breakfast.\u201d\nSarah rolled her eyes, then shrugged.\nHorn looked at her for a moment, and his face was serious and thoughtful. \u201cEnterprising reporter,\u201d he said, as though thinking out loud. \u201cAlways in the right place at the right time.\u201d He didn\u2019t like what he was thinking.\nShe shrugged again. \u201cNot really. I \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cYes, really.\u201d He stopped and reached behind a battered trashcan, hauled out a filthy but otherwise serviceable fatigue jacket. At her look, he said, \u201cI got these things stashed all over town.\u201d He shrugged into it, carefully. Checked the pockets. Two soda cans.\nShe stepped back, waving her hand in front of her face. \u201cChrist, Joe.\u201d\nCryptically, Horn said, \u201cEverybody thinks They Walk By Night, but the truth is They walk whenever They damn well please, because They know how to stay outside the edge of your vision, hiding in the blindspot.\u201d\nShe looked at him like she thought he was truly crazy.\nHe shrugged. I am, he thought. Only the truly insane can deal with reality. He smiled a thin smile, flicked a bug off his collar. \u201cYou were there the day Elmore got the kid and his dad. The day he got the guy in the sweater. The night he got Mac. This morning, when he almost got me.\n\u201cYou interviewed my friends. Fat Freddy. Booger. Cruiser. All of them. And they all died. Vienna sausage for Elmore.\u201d\nShe stared hard at him. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d\nThe smile got thinner. \u201cI made a call while you were waiting outside. Fellow I know at the paper. Says you must keep a pretty low profile, because he never heard of you. And he would have, if you were real. But you\u2019re not real, are you?\u201d\nShe was silent. Blinked. Looked away. Looked back. The flint was still there.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve suspected for a while, haven\u2019t you? Why wait \u2019til now to check me out?\u201d\nHe tilted his head to one side. His own eyes got fairly flinty. \u201cI'm like Mac. I don\u2019t get to meet cute chicks very often.\u201d\nShe hesitated, then said. \u201cI'm a scientist. A type of genetics research.\u201d\nHe grimaced. \u201cThis is going to sound like a bad movie, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nShe forged on. \u201cElmore was a scientist at\u2026 a lab. Something went wrong. He contaminated himself.\u201d She looked away, remembering. \u201cTwo other scientists were contaminated. Some of the stuff we do is very sensitive. And very strange. The operating rules are pretty harsh \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cThe other guys were killed, weren\u2019t they?\u201d\nShe started. \u201cYes.\u201d She didn\u2019t seem too upset. \u201cHow \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cLucky guess.\u201d Then, \u201cYou\u2019re not a scientist.\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cWhat \u2014 ?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re security. First class, too. You effectively masqueraded as a reporter. You found me in the first place. You kept finding me. There aren\u2019t a lot of people who can do that.\u201d\nShe snorted. \u201cHey, man, wake up. You\u2019re a weird guy who walks the streets looking over his shoulder all the time. You look like a bum on speed. You stick out \u2014 \u201d\nHorn was calm. \u201cYou found me, because you heard, somehow, somewhere, about what happened in Seattle. You joked about secret government storage. But it was really something related to what happened to Elmore, right? As a matter of fact, the thing I met in that Seattle warehouse could have been Elmore\u2019s cousin. And I heard that a couple of people who used to hang around there ended up dead. It happens to the homeless, nobody pays much mind. But of course you were careful.\u201d\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t making much sense, Joe.\u201d\nHe stopped smiling altogether. It was starting to hurt his face. \u201cYou move well. Very athletic. We martial artists can see these things. I\u2019ll bet you\u2019re ranked about fourth or fifth dan in something interestingly lethal.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I think you\u2019re paranoid \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cWalk a mile in these shoes, Babe, and you'd be paranoid, too. It\u2019s pretty hard to believe that even the government would send a top grade scientist on an assignment like this. Not exactly in the job description. You killed those two guys yourself, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, sure. That was it. And Elmore got away and I stalked him for six months and watched while he ate a bunch of innocent people \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cField test, to see if the genetic makeover worked.\u201d\n\u201cI was being sarcastic \u2014 \u201c She stopped, seeing the look in his eyes.\n\u201cYou killed the other two because they were failures. Elmore was a success, wasn\u2019t he? And so was the one I got in Seattle. I bet you were plenty pissed about that. Since I'm being paranoid, it\u2019s probably not too far fetched to believe that you sent Elmore down here just to get me.\u201d\nShe started to say something. Maybe a denial, but it caught in her throat. \u201cI \u2014 look, it was my job \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cBut you blew up Elmore when you were supposed to let him get me. Why?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a really good lay,\u201d she said without hesitation.\nHer quiet voice was like a punch in the stomach.\nIn a softer voice he said, \u201cSo what are you going to tell the suits back home?\nThey\u2019re not going to like it much when they find out what happened to Elmore.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s my problem,\u201d she said. She hesitated, like she was waiting for him to give her the answer.\nHe looked at her, said nothing, feeling his gut turn over. \u201cFreddy was my friend.\u201d\nShe nodded, looking down. Then she slowly walked away, rounded the corner onto Broadway, and disappeared.\nHe stared after her for a long time. After a while, he turned and limped back down the alley, into the cool shadows.\n\u2022\n\u00a9 1999 John Craig, all rights reserved","source":null,"source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/ZqOFwXh0IUtWSuRSofMn5pwZ8DY.json"}

You of all people should know\u2014no, no, I\u2019m not angry at you Kishet, it\u2019s just\u2014well now you have to go.\nBest leave at dawn. The way is long, and the desert is hungry and undiscerning. She does not care that we are her children\u2014birthed from the heat of her womb, cut our teeth on the granite of those hills. She has not forgiven our ancestors for leaving her to make their homes in this valley. The desert is majestic and disorienting, stay vigilant. Make your camp well before sunset. Leave enough time before nightfall to cast your protections, and time still for meditations to clear your heart. You must do more than survive the night, you must approach the Three Sisters pure in spirit, and beseech them for their song. Their song is shield and shelter, the only surety against the Shrouded One\u2014that is, should they choose to gift it.\nYou\u2019ll want to take three sorts of bark with you. Yes, three. The berrywood is best burned as an offering\u2014its smoke curls into plumes thick and wine colored, sure to attract Mmbek Moon\u2019s attention. Peels of longola, if for some reason you find yourself needing aid to stay wakeful in order to finish your invocations\u2014steep for a half-turn of the sand glass and no longer. The drink is habit-forming at full potency, and what good will you be to the coven if you return to us eyes open yet unseeing? The last\u2014well, chew on strips torn from the heartshade tree if you find it is not the Three Sisters offering their song. Chew until the bark is a bitter pulp between your cheek and gums and swallow. There are worse fates than an untimely call from the Shrouded One.\nAt sunset, expect the winds\u2014they will be the first to tempt you to return home. The winds will buffet you viciously, whipping fine granules of sand against your skin. It will sting your face, burn your throat, your eyes. They will be the coldest, loudest winds you\u2019ve ever known; roaring against you with a voice that calls up every lonely, anxious lie your mind has ever whispered. But you must not leave. Once you enter the basin of the Three Sisters you must stay until they have given you their blessing, or until the sun rises and the Shrouded One rides the daybreak to carry your spirit onward. As I said, there are worse fates to consider.\nIf you see lights flashing among the black rocks of Sister Eldest, do not go! If you see blue smoke rising from the flat plateau of Sister Middle, do not go! And if you hear the call of the long horn sound from the red caves of Sister Youngest, I repeat, do not go. Aht\u2014Aht! They are our coven\u2019s signals, yes, but this is no trade route you are on. There are mimics in those hills who only deal in cuts of flesh. No, you want no part of their commerce.\nKishet, sit my child, you have gone ashen. Of course, of course, but this could have all been avoided, you know, if only you\u2019d come to me sooner. There are bindings, talismans, but now? Naught will do to keep you from the Shrouded One except the sisters, should they choose.\nExpect this night to be the longest of your young life. There will be no sleep, no reprieve. Only prayer, and with any hope, a blessing. At the bottom of the night, when you are weakest, when the hairs on your nape prickle from the rake of eyes unseen, and you begin to hear wordless susurrations against the shell of your ear exposing your worst transgressions, taunting you with your deepest fears, do not leave.\nInstead, light your offering to Mmbek Moon and look for his Winged Child. Oh? Trust in me, you will know when they arrive. Winged Child is larger than any golden owl you have ever seen\u2014what? For Dream\u2019s sake, Kishet, they glow! Their luminescence will rival anything you should see that night save the sacred face of Mmbek Moon himself. And Winged Child is fierce! Though they are frightful to behold, do not despair. They will grant you comfort and protection from the unseen threats. But know that should you survive this, you will be indebted to Mmbek Moon and his Winged Child. And there will be no refusing when they come to collect.\nHow I wish I could bear this trial instead of you, sweet one. But you are strong, Kishet, you will survive it, you must. You are shored up by an earth-old bloodline, guileless in heart, you must believe the Sisters will bless you with their song for it to be so. If you fail? If you fail, then you will die forlorn, Kishet. Without the comfort of your mother-father or your siblings, without the honor of the bells. After the Shrouded One carries away your spirit, the scavengers will gorge on your flesh. The sun will bleach your bones by day and the fleshless ones will curl around your remains, contorting your discarded vertebrae in a dance most vulgar by night. You never should have sought to interpret the dream alone. Did you not trust in the wisdom of your Elder? Ego is the first indication of the usurper; careful not to reach for what is not meant for you. Consider this a lesson, Kishet, if you fail it will be with the knowledge that you alone brought on your early demise. Hubris is a sin and interdependence, our salvation. Learn this well, and we\u2019ll never speak of your heresy again. Do everything in your power to return to us. I would be most displeased to lose yet another coven-child in the basin of the Three Sisters.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue36\/3lbe36_story2.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"What is the best way to survive a night amongst the singing hills, you ask?

Mud pressed beneath me, but not even it was cool; it tugged at the knees of my trousers as with a warm mouth. Across the road under the emerald canopy my Rupert grinned crooked, teeth bright above the once-white ruff at his bearded chin, then tipped his head toward the approaching coach.\nThe coach of white and gilt rattled over our ill-placed stones in the road and the horse panicked. With a scream of horse, driver, and passenger alike, the entire vehicle tipped over, into the thick bracken. Rupert leapt.\nHe reached the driver first and I scrambled my way up the belly of the coach, grabbing for door handle and knife, though before I could claim the former, a swift hand emerged from the window to grasp my arm and haul me inside. I fit perfectly well through the window. Unemployment, homelessness, and slow starvation will do that to a fellow. Rupert had not sold a painting in months.\nInside all was dark, the inside of an egg, perfectly sealed. The woman held me firm, by arm and throat both, and while I glimpsed her eyes in the darkness\u2014crimson the way a summer berry may be\u2014it was the froth of fabric around her throat which took my breath and rendered me unable to struggle.\nThe figure-eight folds of lace were flawlessly white; no dye, no colored starch. At each crest, a ruby gleamed. In each valley, seed pearls pooled. The pearls seemed to hover above her still chest, while the rubies drew in just enough of the day\u2019s light to illuminate her jaw with a faint blush her own body would never manufacture.\nWhen I met her eyes again, they were terribly close and I saw the flash of her sharp mouth before it latched onto my filthy throat. Pain like no other cut through me and then ebbed, replaced with the soft embrace of a stifling darkness. I could not breathe. I could not move.\nThere was a pinprick of bright blood on her ruff when next I looked. I blinked, as if to clear it from my sight, but the lace remained marred. I didn\u2019t know until we reached her home if it was her blood or mine.\nWe crawled out of the carriage only when the sun had set. I blinked at the sky above us which seemed to yawn with an impossible depth. I would have stared all night had she not led me across the stones and into her home. Only there did I turn and reach for Rupert who was not there. I stared instead at the driver, whose mouth was stained crimson, and licked my own lips, feeling a hunger I could not explain. The lady tugged me up stairs, into a candle-strewn room, where she pulled me into her lap and the lace of her ruff brushed my mouth.\nThe blood on the lace was her own. Sweet.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nShoe Roses - 1650\nDespite the late hour, Mr. Odigaunt\u2019s Haberdashery is a mad cacophony of servants and sound. Everyone has need of something different and of course they require it immediately, as their master or mistress has waited until the last moment to tell them. My errand is no less dear, but I am content to peruse the bins of buttons, loose spools of threads, and needles. Anything to delay looking through the spools of satin and lace.\nTaken as they are with their own needs, no one truly notices me. It is often the case and how we are so often able to prey on people in public. As one might gather the pleats in a skirt, one might also gather shadows into a corner, so that a neck can be exposed.\nMy fingers hovered over the displayed needles, finding them less sharp than my own teeth. Mr. Odigaunt took to keeping a display of bone needles, each decorated with miniature oil paintings. Down the length of one needle, a dozen ladies danced, where upon another a man turned his slender ankle out as he made a leg.\n\u201cMister Digby.\u201d\n\u201cMister Odigaunt.\u201d\nHe is as his name presumes: tall, thin, pale. His hair is silvered, his cheeks drawn hollow. His collar is, naturally, without flaw. He appears as though he suffered a difficult youth, ill and indoors most of the time, given to exploring his mother\u2019s things, hence his haberdashery. As my fingers sift through the buttons, I wonder how many adorned her own clothing.\n\u201cThe greens, if you would,\u201d I say and he bows, turning to the ribbon display behind him.\nHis ribbons are kept pristine in custom-made cases so that smoke, dirt, and sunlight cannot touch them. I sometimes feel as though I am in such a case myself. Mister Odigaunt opens one case, sweeps aside the protective black curtain within, and a host of green ribbons are exposed. The small spools are skewered upon long bobbins, easily removed; Mister Odigaunt removes two bobbins and sets them upright in notches on the long gleaming counter. This allows me to study the ribbon at leisure, remembering only Rupert\u2019s eyes for the longest time.\n\u201cShoe roses,\u201d I murmur to Odigaunt when he doesn\u2019t move to help another customer.\nHe clicks his tongue. \u201cAh. The pattern?\u201d\n\u201cA heeled boot with, if you can believe it, both pomegranates and artichokes.\u201d\nOdigaunt\u2019s brows lift. Both were usually unheard of in the same fabric, but Gabriel Varcoe rarely cared what others would think. The idea that I was to add shoe roses to the heeled boots pooled between Odigaunt and myself a long time, until the haberdasher could no longer bear it.\n\u201cMust you?\u201d\nI inclined my head. \u201cI must.\u201d\nHis lips press into a thin line. \u201cIf I may make a suggestion,\u201d he began and when I nodded, his needle-like fingers sought the ribbon he would suggest. \u201cAs plain as you may go, Mr. Digby.\u201d\nEven so the ribbon is splendid, the length of silk the color of new artichokes (ah, Rupert\u2019s eyes, still), finished with a simple gold stitch which encloses the raw silk edge. There is a similar ribbon, however, with edging the color of pomegranates. As though it were made for the very boots I intend to decorate. My fingers alight there. Odigaunt\u2019s lips press thinner.\nLater, in the alley behind haberdashery, where the air is thick with rotting refuse, I press Mr. Odigaunt into the shadows and expose his length of neck (his collar is sheer linen and here he smells of smoky tobacco). He tastes the way you might envision that ribbon does: smooth with a hint of unexpected color. He is subtle, unlike Gabriel\u2019s heeled boots.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nPatches - 1743\n\u201cWhat of her?\u201d\nFrom the shadows, my eyes narrow on the woman young George Newton indicates. She is draped in aquamarine satin, yards and yards of it which blossom around her small waist like rioting petals. Her d\u00e9colletage swells from this uprising, buoyed by boned and pearl-crusted round-topped stomachers which circle her torso like ocean waves. Fairy and mermaid both, like the Covenant Garden theater around us she glows with something I cannot define. She should be overdone, but she is not. Until I reach her face. Oh, misfortune.\n\u201cDigby?\u201d\nHe somehow hisses my name, though it has not a single S in it.\n\u201cNot her,\u201d is all I say.\nHer face itself is well made, a careful hand at work when it comes to her bone structure and the way her gilded hair curls upward into frothing foam drenched with more pearls. It is the patch in the center of her forehead which causes offense.\nFrom this distance, I presume the fabric is black velvet; it is cut into the shape of a star. When she turns her head, I see another perched atop her cheek (a heart), and yet another (an errant moon) clinging to the side of her chin\u2014though its glue has loosened and it seems likely to drop into her d\u00e9colletage.\nSomehow, though I am still at a loss to explain it, these small patches are presumed to tell the world of a woman\u2019s disposition before one has spoken a single word. The patch on her forehead claims she is dignified, but from there the theory dissolves, for how can one be dignified with a black velvet star pasted to one\u2019s forehead?\n\u201cAnd her?\u201d\nI fear this evening will not end any time soon. Eventually, the music will begin and the theater will further darken, but now, we watch the people mingle, and my lord, he looks for a suitable lady to court, to silence his parents. I stand in the shadows; I should not be here, but Newton values my opinions, especially when it comes to ladies and fashion.\nThis second woman is no better than the first. She is dressed in brown, which turns her skin to ash. Her split sleeves spill a waterfall of magnificent lace, but she wears a red heart-shaped patch against her right cheek. \u201cPresumed to be married,\u201d I murmur and Newton laughs.\n\u201cThat would be part of the fun, no?\u201d\n\u201cIf it is a bride you genuinely seek and a long life with her, then no, my lord.\u201d\nHe grunts, eyes continuing to survey the crowd. He murmurs to those he knows as they pass, and inclines his head to those he does not. He makes no forward move toward any of the women, his eyes trespassing back to me time and time again.\nLater, after Handel\u2019s song has been sung and the theater emptied, we linger in Newton\u2019s box. I admire the tangle of cutwork lace against his throat and the way he exhales when he leans into me. He is slender and tall. I stroke my fingers down his throat and the theater darkens yet again.\nHis coat is silk lampas, ivory flowers blooming across moss green. As I buttoned it earlier this evening, so I unbutton it now. I look up and Newton looks down, sherry eyes gleaming. The line of his nose echoes Rupert\u2019s.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nTop Hat - 1841\n\u201cI simply refused.\u201d\n\u201cAs one must.\u201d\nLamp light warms William Odigaunt\u2019s front room, glossing over the fabrics and laces with which we worked. Little had changed in this room over the centuries; cases and drawers stretched behind the counter, grooves worn into handles. The ribbons linger in their special cases and those painted bone needles stand as they ever have, awaiting a buyer. We perch on either side of the wood counter, fingers busily stitching. I had this evening free of my normal duties and came to Odigaunt\u2019s as I so often do.\nHe tosses aside the bonnet with a scowl. \u201cThis is dreadful.\u201d His thin hands curl into the mass of scarlet ribbon before him, then begin winding it back onto the spool. \u201cI shall refuse this as well. It is my position and expertise, surely she will appreciate that I refuse to let her fly blind into questionable fashion decisions.\u201d\n\u201cSometimes they do like to soar,\u201d I mutter. At one time, fashion had seemed simple. Now, it was a confusion of indoor bonnets, V-necklines, and the horror of spaniel curls. The ever-increasing height of top hats had me wondering if the entire city was making up for attributes they otherwise lacked.\nOdigaunt\u2019s fingers work steadily with the ribbon. I watch him in the lamp light, finding a strange comfort there. He was my only friend, or shall I say the only friend who weathered the years as I did. His silvered head lifts when the bells at the door chime. The door groans and I follow his gaze.\nThe gentleman framed in the doorway nearly has to duck because of his hat. I wondered who had fashioned the awful accessory, but didn\u2019t dare ask, lest he think I was interested in such. This might well lead to the acquisition of one such hat for myself. His brunet hair curled against his long sideburns, moustache rioting over his lip. I wondered how he kept the blood from it, for as he came closer it was plain he was of the same cut as Odigaunt and myself. He felt as dead as roses in winter.\n\u201cGentlemen,\u201d he said and inclined his head toward us. His gaze lingered on Odigaunt, as if trying to place him.\nMost didn\u2019t look twice at Odigaunt, for all his curious features. Most were too wrapped in their own concerns (the gold or the plain?) and needs (oh, only three buttons, I saved the fourth, such thrift!). If anyone did query, for there had been times when a wrinkled woman would recall a tall thin man very like him in this shop from her youth, Odigaunt explained that the business, like the genes, ran strong and true in his family. They had always held this business, and always would, much as he held his father\u2019s face, and his grandfather\u2019s. Most seemed content, for Odigaunt was but a haberdasher (let us claim our notions and go).\n\u201cHow may we be of assistance this evening?\u201d Odigaunt asked him. I stayed busy with the indoor bonnet in my hands, meant to be a gift for young Mister Wells\u2019s mother. It was Odigaunt\u2019s theory that if I made the repulsive item myself, I might have a better appreciation for the fashion in the end. I remained doubtful, for even Odigaunt had discarded his in-progress bonnet.\n\u201cI am looking to acquire\u2014\u201d\nAnd there he paused, as if he had come for something illicit indeed. His eyes are on me. Hooded by hat and hair, I cannot say what color they are, nor what expression pools within.\n\u201c\u2014a ruff.\u201d\nHe lifted a hand then to the counter and from it spilled three rubies and countless seed pearls.\nI sat upright as though I had been pricked in a tender spot with a needle. I felt the weight of Odigaunt\u2019s eyes on me, but he soon turned back to his customer. It seemed my own face should be flushed with color, but I knew it was only pale. Pale and growing colder for those rubies and pearls drew me backward in time, as though the carriage accident had happened but that morning.\n\u201cAttending a masquerade?\u201d Odigaunt asks him and turns to the case of laces he kept for ruffs.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nThe vampire offered nothing more. He looks at me, though, as if trying to gauge my reaction. My reaction was to drop the mess of bonnet on the counter and lunge for him, overcome by an impulse I could not explain. I knocked the absurdly tall top hat from his head and was satisfied when he stepped on it in his haste to back away from me.\nHis eyes, once out of shadow of hat and hair, were black. They were not the green I expected to find and my heart, if I still had such a thing, felt lodged in my throat.\n\u201cDigby.\u201d\nOdigaunt\u2019s hands tightened on my arms, drawing me back. I let him push me back onto the counter stool, let him mutter apologies to the gentleman as he retrieved the squashed hat. I stared at the gems in the lamp light and felt an ache inside me, one I believed long dead. Some things, I supposed, never really died, even when mortal flesh did.\nThey conducted their business, the vampire oddly not put off by remaining here. I said nothing, did nothing, only stared at the rubies and the light that bled through them. Later, there would be blood spilled. So much blood, Odigaunt would curse me as he tried to wash it from my linen shirt.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nCravat - 1902\n\u201cAnd the bat pin.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, sir.\u201d\nI drew the watered evergreen silk around Paul Nesbit\u2019s neck, letting it hang somewhat longer on his right hand side. Crossing the wide panels, I could not help but admire the way his unfolded collar stood against his throat. It might have hidden his pulse from a normal man, but not from me. I could hear it as surely as I could a clock counting the seconds.\nSixty-one years.\nSixteen rubies.\nI steadily worked on Nesbit\u2019s cravat, but it was the rubies I thought of, concealed in my pocket. They had arrived at unsteady intervals, always sent to Odigaunt\u2019s shop, always addressed to me. When a year passed without one\u2014as often did happen\u2014I was astonished by the melancholy that would overcome me. As though I had lost everything all over again.\nWhen one did arrive, it was a similar sense of astonishment; a curious stuttering of happiness in my chest. Happiness at the disruption of the normal routine, happiness that one could still feel surprise after three hundred and twenty-seven years. Was Joan playing a game? Was Rupert? So far as I knew, neither yet lived, but the rubies and pearls made me wonder, for the jewels had been her own, and Rupert the only other one there that day.\n\u201cDigby.\u201d\nNesbit\u2019s hands upon my own coupled with his strangled voice made me realize I had unintentionally ruched his cravat.\n\u201cApologies,\u201d I murmured, and set to working at the fabric yet again, admiring the way the light caught the deep color.\nSixteen rubies, which meant there were another sixteen to come, for thirty-six of them had adorned her ruff. After the tumble into her dirt-dark bed, I had counted, secretly, as she slept the day through. I had not counted the seed pearls, for they seemed too many. I was content to smooth my fingers over their cool hides and imagine the waters that had once held them. Whenever Odigaunt used pearls, he asked me of their quality; I had an opinion or two, always.\nI eased the flap of silk through the loop I had made and carefully smoothed it over Nesbit\u2019s chest. I plucked the tie pin from the nearby by tray, a small bat that was fashioned of mother-of-pearl and I skewered the fabric, smoothing it flat once more. Nesbit claimed his own jacket and was gone before I could do anything else for him. I blew an unnecessary breath through my nose.\nThe day seemed unbearably long and when I finally left, the next day being my day of rest, it was Odigaunt\u2019s I fled to, asking a silent question as I came into the room. His bony fingers slid an envelope across the counter to me.\nA year had passed since the last ruby. It wasn\u2019t the longest wait I had endured, but long enough. I moved toward the counter as one in a trance, noting the handwriting upon the envelope. It was the same as it had ever been, though whose it was I could not say. I had never seen Joan write and Rupert had been as illiterate as I.\nThe envelope smelled like tobacco, this new and strange. I looked up at Odigaunt and he laughed without me having to ask. He must have wondered it all day.\n\u201cBut who brought it?\u201d I asked.\nHis answer was ever the same. \u201cA young boy, indescribable from any young boy you would see on the streets. He could be anyone, though this boy was different.\u201d And here, Odigaunt\u2019s mouth pressed thin. \u201cWhen I asked who sent him, he opened his mouth to show me that his tongue had been removed.\u201d\nI pressed the envelope to the counter, not needing to open it to know it contained a ruby, the round lump of gem pressed against the paper.\n\u201cSurely only a coincidence?\u201d I asked. The rubies had hardly been hostile in their arrival. Despite that long-ago vampire delivering the first trio, there had been no threat, and that which came with him may well have been imagined. Had he been amused by it all? I had never seen him again.\nWe looked for the boy, of course we did. But if anyone knew of a tongueless young man, they said nothing. Irony?\nI did then what I always did, slipping into the back room at Odigaunt\u2019s, spilling the rubies from my pocket onto the polished counter and adding the newest to it. In a cup nearby there pooled countless seed pearls. Odigaunt collected them for me, so that when the time came, I could remake Joan\u2019s ruff.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nErmine-Trimmed Cape - 1975\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if glam means to repulse people.\u201d\n\u201cYou can almost forgive it for that, but punk\u2026 Well.\u201d\nOdigaunt and I sat behind his counter, each of us working on projects we never would have imagined a hundred years before. A length of red velvet pooled in my lap, a smaller stretch of ermine pinned against its edge as I stitched it into place. Odigaunt attempted keep a straight face while he sewed golden and red flames up the leg and across the crotch of a polyester jumpsuit. Odigaunt\u2019s tongue peeked from between his lips, a sincere effort.\n\u201cThis is absurd,\u201d he finally murmured, but his fingers never slowed in their task. He made blind-stitch after blind-stitch and though his work humiliated him, it was decidedly beautiful in its own way. The trail of flames ran like a river across the blue polyester.\n\u201cHow far we have fallen, Digby. It\u2019s not bad enough that people wander about the streets in their small clothes, but now we have performers upon the very stage in this\u201d\u2014and here, he shook the garment before returning to his stitching\u2014\u201cthis\u2026\u201d He shuddered, seeming incapable of finding a word for what he created.\n\u201cArt,\u201d I offered. Odigaunt\u2019s head came up sharply and he just looked at me. I shrugged and insisted, \u201cIt is.\u201d I leaned over the red velvet cape, to stroke fingers across the satin flames. \u201cLook at the way you cut this, so that one flame mirrors another and runs like liquid up the body.\u201d I pictured the performer in question, whip-slim and angled, and I exhaled. Oh, me. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d\nOdigaunt\u2019s thin lips quirked upward, then settled once more into their thin line. No tongue this time, but a crease between his eyes as he continued to stitch.\n\u201cAnd yours?\u201d\nWhen he asked, I looked to the ermine and velvet. \u201cIt\u2019s dreadfully long,\u201d I said. I worried that it would be stepped on, crushed, and yet, perhaps that was part of the idea. That one might trample the symbol of king and kingdom. Or queen, as the case may be. The satin lining, the careful trim\u2026 he would step on it, it would tear.\n\u201cCan you imagine,\u201d Odigaunt said, \u201cif we paired them?\u201d He flung the flaming polyester over the red velvet. The world seemed to stop\u2014was it blood rushing into my ears after all these centuries? I stared, horrified. Then, eventually, I became aware of Mott the Hoople blaring as a car passed.\n\u201cPomegranates and artichokes,\u201d I whispered.\nOdigaunt laughed and drew his flames back into his own lap. \u201cHow some things never change.\u201d\nAt that, my eyes fell upon the nearest glass case; Odigaunt had pushed back the interior curtain some weeks ago, to expose the contents. Many customers asked about it. Not spooled ribbons this time, but a near-complete ruff, lacking only one ruby. The whole of a man\u2019s life could shift, but some things remained ever true.\nMy room upstairs held the evidence of that, ribbon-tied envelopes that once held rubies. Odigaunt was, indeed, a victim of his past as well, haunted by all the things we spent our days amid. Buttons, thread, and those painted needles. Those bone needles, as it happens, belonged to his dear mother; Odigaunt painted them himself during a long and rainy winter.\nWhile people asked after the ruff, we made clear it was not for sale, as it was incomplete. Not that I would have let it go had that final ruby been in place. How strange, that a man\u2019s life may pause for a single gemstone, and yet, it wasn\u2019t the ruby I sought, was it?\nIt was only after I stopped looking that things began to fall into my lap. The December night was chilled and bit into my cheeks as Odigaunt and I bundled into his Corvair and made our way to the concert hall. Costumes nearly overflowed the car and we were lucky to arrive with only a wrinkle or two.\nI noticed it when I was dressing him, as my fingers smoothed the cape into place and I set to stitching an errant length of ermine that seemed determined to come off. My eyes wandered to the mirror and I was drawn nearly through its surface, backward in time to that tumbled carriage and the set of a driver\u2019s bloody mouth. (Rupert\u2019s blood.) It was the same mouth I saw now, the same eyes which looked upon me.\nMy mouth parted in silent wonder. He shook his head.\n\u201cI could not have asked for a better cape,\u201d is what he said, but that isn\u2019t what I heard. In my mind, I saw the cape as Rupert\u2014in his mind, I saw the sweet memory:\nA leaping young man with eyes bright as the forest canopy; the scent of mud coupled with the meat pie we had eaten only a short time before. (You would think this memory would ease over time, but I can still remember the melted cheese and the luck of having carrots as well.) Firm hands, so strong and yet impossibly fragile when it came down to it, clinging to immortal arms. Rupert\u2019s fingers, Rupert\u2019s throat, his pulse bright beyond the curl of his filthy ruff. The shock of that mortal blood, bright like poppies under a summer sun, and then\u2014\nThe ruby pressed hard into my palm.\nHe said nothing, only moved away under the guidance of his handlers, toward the crowd who clamored for him, for his music. I enclosed the gem within my shaking hand and was never so close to him as I was then, for fame would take him to places I could not reach. Not after tonight, not after they saw him in that ermine-trimmed cape.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBone Keys and Needles - 2011\nI drew her ebony hair up along the crown of her head and ringlets cascaded down.\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cMmm.\u201d\nQueen Elizabeth had worn her hair like this long ago, I knew. I could remember every pin and every tuck, even though my own hands had not made them. Now, for this Elisabeth, I did, each pin as black as her eyes, each tipped with a small pearl that glistened. When Odigaunt drew a black satin ruff around her throat, she sucked in another breath.\n\u201cBut it hides the key,\u201d she murmured.\n\u201cTo be discovered only by those who should,\u201d Odigaunt said, and gently tied the ruff closed at her nape.\nHer fingers slipped under the ruff, to likely press against the bone. She seemed enthralled by this idea, her pink mouth tipping upward. \u201cOh.\u201d\nShe seemed from an earlier time, one of mourning fashions; a time when the world did not run on technology, nor electricity, nor caffeine. In this age, one supposed I could flit to the glowing computer screen, summon a search engine, and input that which I sought. Despite the wonders of the Internet (and let us be fair, the horrors), it had not been able to conjure the thing I had lost.\nNor had Joan\u2019s ruff, now whole behind its glass case, made her emerge from London\u2019s streets. Some part of me had believed that once the item was complete, there she would be, called by the power of those gems, ready for me to tie the ruffle around her neck. We would laugh at the idea of her driver on stage, then raise a glass to him in fond memory now. We would murmur too of Rupert. Where was he? Oh, lost to the ages, she would say, and we would bow our heads together, only to find him running toward us when we looked up again. His feet would pound the cobblestones and behind him, moonlight would gleam as new London faded to old once more and a rising soundtrack encompassed us and pulled us into the black of end credits. Tidy.\nLife was not like this. Part of me wished it were so, while the other part knew not to wish. Our days were spent with fabrics and laces, with ribbons and buttons. Odigaunt had lost his fair share yet never once did I hear him groan to have it back. Perhaps he was relieved at all that had fallen away, light now and unburdened. Whereas I still felt the hole of the thing taken.\nJoan and Rupert were surely not the only people I had lost through the years. I thought of Gabriel Varcoe and was still pained\u2014though did have to wonder if it was the memory of him, or the memory of his shoes which had become part of the historical collection at the Museum of London. Anyone might see those shoes! I had taken Odigaunt only the previous spring, and oh the dismay remained fresh. Yet, Joan and Rupert were kept closest to my heart because\u2014\nWell, one does not need to itemize the facts when one knows them so well.\n\u201cThank you, Digby.\u201d\nElisabeth\u2019s lips against my cheek are startlingly warm. She fusses over us, tells us that we shouldn\u2019t keep the building so chilled, for our cheeks are always like ice. She gives my cheek a pat now, and then slips an envelope into my hand. I stare at it a long while; it is flat, no tell-tale bump of a ruby. Then, I look into her black eyes.\n\u201cSomeone asked that you receive that.\u201d\nI wait until she goes, until Odigaunt has closed the groaning door after her and looks at me as if he is about to burst. He gives me such a look at my delay, I find myself amused, drawn back to the memory of him in the alley, all unexpected color against my tongue.\n\u201cDigby!\u201d\nI carefully open the envelope with only my fingers, not wanting to waste time in finding an opener. The envelope is also the letter, so old fashioned in the way it is folded that it makes my heart leap. No wax seal or ribbon, but these things don\u2019t matter. There were countless lines upon the small page, written to and fro and back again, a palimpsest in my shaking hands and it\u2019s one line that leaps out at me, \u201cI, cumber\u2019d with good manners, answer do, but know not how, for still I think of you.\u201d\nThough I have never seen Rupert\u2019s handwriting, I know it to belong to him. The way I would know the turn of a collar or a heel. The way I had known the color of his eyes in the curl of a ribbon, or the lift of his mouth in the rise of a hat. The words are not his own, but they are old indeed, a cycle of sonnets beloved of Joan.\nThe bells on the door chime, then, and the door makes its customary protest as it swings inward. The man who enters is impossibly young and Odigaunt and I both stare. Something has changed in those well-remembered eyes\u2014untidy\u2014but I would wish for nothing else, for oh the stories he must have to tell. I am already counting the evenings and it takes more than both hands.\n\u201cI have come to see a man about a ruff,\u201d Rupert says, and his smile is that of the devil, crooked.\nEver my downfall.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue31\/3lbe31_story2.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"The ruff was ever my downfall.

David Fulcher\nThe next moments were awful, with just me holding my breath while beyond the closet door the Bogeyman made his horrible noises. I was afraid I would wet myself again. Finally, Mom arrived.\nThe door opened just a crack, but even that was enough to let in the night light from the hall, the long yellow triangle of light cutting across my floor. The border between my bed and the closet was once again a safe zone.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, dear?\u201d she asked. Her voice helped me in the dark to think of other things\u2026 of cotton candy and ice cream, kites at the beach and Christmas gifts.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Bogeyman. he\u2019s back again!\u201d I said, breathing fast and quick.\nShe came over and sat down next to me on the bed. She took my hands in her big, dry ones. \u201cThere, there Charlie. I thought I told you the bogeyman was just a fairy tale?\u201d\n\u201che\u2019s real! I can hear him. He waits until I'm alone, until the lights are out.\u201d\nMom stood up suddenly. \u201cIs he in here, Charlie? Do you want me to open the closet and scare him away?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d I cried out.\n\u201cPlease Charlie, get some sleep. You have school early in the morning.\u201d\nShe sat down again and messed my hair. I know I'm supposed to be too big to like that, but it still makes me feel better.\n\u201cCan we leave the door open? Just a little bit so that I can see the night light?\u201d\nShe pulled me close, and her hair reminded me of strawberries. \u201cWhatever you want, hon. I'm just down the hall.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I want.\u201d I replied.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she answered, pulling my sheets up and kissing my forehead. \u201cBut someday you\u2019ll have to get over your fear of the dark.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the dark I'm afraid of. It\u2019s the Bogeyman.\u201d\n\u201cGoodnight, Charlie,\u201d she said, standing in the doorway on her way out.\n\u201cGoodnight,\u201d I answered. She kept her promise and left the door open a little.\nI moved to the edge of the bed, and looked over. The triangle of light from the hall stopped just short of the closet door. Sometimes it made light, too, an awful green-brown light like the water in the creek behind my house where we catch crayfish. It was dark right now.\nI felt less scared because suddenly I was dreaming. First, I dreamed about things I like: cowboys and Indians, airplanes and spaceships, baseball and cookies. Then the dream didn\u2019t feel so good.\nI was on my bed floating in the middle of space. I mean, it felt like space, but there weren\u2019t any stars or anything. Just a lot of dark nothing. I knew I was no longer in my room because I couldn\u2019t hear the neighbor\u2019s dog barking and that dog is always barking. Actually I couldn\u2019t hear anything, not even my own breathing or the rustle of the covers as I crawled around to look over the edges of the bed.\nI felt pricklies on the back of my neck and sat back quickly to the headboard, clutching my pillow in front of me. If I hadn\u2019t seen the dark purple of its skin, I wouldn\u2019t have known it was coming down at me. Now I wish I hadn\u2019t seen it.\nIt had four sail-shape wings, swept way back to get me in their folds. Like a manta ray I saw on the Discovery channel. Glowy blue dangle-things hung down from its tummy like a thousand eyes.\nMy screams were lost in the dark as the slick oily skin ate me\u2026\n\u2022\nI was almost asleep when the Bogeyman started making his hungry noises. I think he is part insect, 'cause he clicks and slurps and whirs like a giant spider cricket.\nMaybe even a roach. I wrapped the pillow around my head and held it tight against my ears. On the wall, I could see the flicky green-brown. I forced myself to not turn around.'Cause I knew the light was pouring out of the crack around the door.\nThe light got hotter until my back felt like sunburn. Still I forced myself to stay on this side of the bed and look straight ahead, holding the pillow to my ears, biting my tongue, and blinking out tears from eyes overshut.\nThen the Bogeyman broke the rules. I heard the rusting creak of the closet door hinge.\nImpossible. He can\u2019t leave the closet!\nThe creaking got louder, the door almost open\u2026\nHe was breaking the rules, so what else could I do? And mom said too I was gonna have to face it someday\u2026 I spun around to face the Bogeyman.\nThe nightmare was over. I caught my breath. 'Cause it was just Mom standing there in the open closet.\nThere was a click and whir when she turned her head to look at me.\n\u201cCharlie! What are you doing up? School comes early. You really must get over this foolish fear of the dark!\u201d\nI smiled at her and blushed. You'd never think such a baby like me was in third grade!\nShe smiled lovingly back at me. Then I saw something in her hands. It was round and black, big as a basketball. Its thin glowy green arms worked wire strippers and a soldering iron, on the mess of wires and motors in her chest. It paused for a second and looked at me with one alien, purple eye. Showing off, it ballooned out its sail-shape egg sack and slick black wings.\nThe clock read 9:05. I screamed and screamed.\n\u2022\n\u00a9 1999 R.

It was Jessie\u2019s idea. She thought it would help, and anything that helps Jessie at the moment has to be given a try. When she described Uisk, he imagined a romantic landscape, a Brigadoon-type place, with green mountains and deep valleys roamed by stags. Jessie was still a child when she left and her memories are consequently full of giants, unadjusted for the inflation of intervening years.\nIn reality, this place is a bog.\nJack unpacks the rented car. The air inside the cottage is moist and unwelcoming. He piles their bags just inside the door, alone in the fading light. Jessie has taken Innes up the hill. It\u2019s November, very much the wrong time of year for Scotland, and he worries it will be dark before she finds her way back down. He pictures her slipping and cracking an ankle, tumbling into the bog, drowning in shallow mud. He tries to laugh at himself. Why catastrophize, when the worst has already happened?\nThrough the clouded windows, he feels the bog watching him. He can hear it breathing, big, ballooning breaths like an enormous animal. At least, he imagines he can.\nThe bags are unpacked and the electric heaters lit in both rooms by the time Jessie gets back. She puts Innes on the kitchen counter, touches her fingers distractedly to the back of Jack\u2019s neck, and starts to cook some pasta which none of them will eat.\nIn bed that night he wakes to find her rigid, every muscle clenched, tears flooding furiously from her closed eyes. He tries to hold her. Their attempts at comfort are clumsy, like schoolchildren formulating a first kiss. They don\u2019t know how to do any of this. Nothing in the books about it. She doesn\u2019t sleep. He suspects she hasn\u2019t slept in weeks.\nHe dreams of lying at the bottom of a bog and tasting the layers of peat, mud, acid, moss, all the way up to the sky.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSome of the older residents remember Jessie. She feels no need to seek any of them out, doesn\u2019t know them well enough to burden herself with social calls, but occasionally one of them will stop her in the street or in the little supermarket and say, \u201cWell, isn\u2019t that Chessick?\u201d And even on her worst days Jessie will smile, out of politeness, answer a few questions about her parents, make vague promises to stop round for a cup of tea. She doesn\u2019t tell them why they\u2019re here. From the way they gently lay their eyes on her, though, and the way their hands hover through the air, Jack wonders if they already know.\n\u201cWho\u2019s Chessick?\u201d he asks as they\u2019re driving back to the cottage.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Teasag,\u201d she replies, and spells it. \u201cJust the Gaelic way of saying \u2018Jessie,\u2019 that\u2019s all.\u201d\nShe\u2019s told him before that she doesn\u2019t speak Gaelic, doesn\u2019t remember any of it, but being back here seems to trigger the odd word. Like dead roots resurfacing from the ground, she will point things out\u2014a seagull, a stone wall\u2014and say wonderingly, \u201cFaoileag. G\u00e0rradh.\u201d\nThey spend the first few days cooking, walking, trying to read. They\u2019re not ready yet to do what they came here to do, so they don\u2019t speak about it. At night, Innes perches next to the bed, within easy reach. They climb the hill, carrying Innes with them, and at the top Jack looks out over miles and miles of marsh. The sky here seems so low. He could reach up and grab the rusted clouds. There is a flat rock with a giant footprint carved in it, a king\u2019s footprint, Jessie tells him. He puts his muddy boot into it and sees himself dwarfed.\nThey walk through the bog. There are paths, though not obvious ones. He follows Jessie. She seems able to find her way, while Jack grows quickly disorientated. Their progress is slow and each walk takes several hours, no matter which direction they go. Jack becomes mildly delirious on these walks. The bog is not dead, as he first thought. Insects and miniscule birds flit between grass mounds and the waters move like slow breath. Jessie tells him bog facts: a peat bog is ninety percent water\u2014you\u2019re walking on water right now; it can hold twice as much carbon as a forest. He isn\u2019t listening.\nA patch of raised ground lies to his left, just a few steps away. Jessie is heading round the long way, sticking to the path. He says, \u201cLook\u2014shortcut.\u201d Places his foot. Jessie says, \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d He\u2019s already two steps in. Another two, and the mud fountains up over his boot, dragging him, sucking his leg into the depths. He is being pulled downwards as though by a living force. He has to stagger, overbalance, catch Jessie\u2019s hand. The boot comes off with a gargling slurp.\nJack walks home in his drenched sock. Jessie is furious and doesn\u2019t speak to him the whole way. Hours later, she still hasn\u2019t spoken. It\u2019s the grief, he tells himself, it\u2019s the hormones, not him.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe thought of scattering Innes into that sickly muck makes him want to scream.\nHe knows Jessie feels the same things that he does. The emptiness in his arms, which have grown used to Innes\u2019s soft weight resting between them. The rushing nausea when he tries to eat. The guilt which crushes him like an anchor out of the sky. If only we\u2019d woken up earlier. Checked on him. Taken him to the hospital in time. He knows she feels these things too, but there is a glass wall between them and he is alone with his thoughts on his side, she alone on hers.\nThey cook and walk and go to the supermarket. The days count down.\nThe spit of gravel where they park their car floods one night, the hand of the bog flowing up and over its surface, trying to snatch the vehicle into its depth. Stranded weeds and a layer of blackish mud left behind smear the stones.\nAlain who owns the cottage comes round. \u201cJust seeing how ye are,\u201d he says in a bland tone which causes Jack\u2019s teeth to grind. Alain is a widower; it\u2019s obvious in his stale breath, his creased clothes. He probably thinks he knows what they\u2019re going through.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not for everyone,\u201d he says, nodding out of the window to where the restless edge of the bog licks the banked gravel. \u201cTakes a bit of getting used to.\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d says Jessie.\n\u201cAye, you would.\u201d Alain crinkles his eyes at her. \u201cPeople round here, they say if you cut us, we bleed bog water. It\u2019s part of who we are.\u201d He turns to Jack, his tone lightly accusing. \u201cWhat d\u2019you think of it?\u201d\nJack wants to say, It\u2019s horrible. Fetid. Unnatural. Instead he says, \u201cLot of wildlife.\u201d\nAlain says, \u201cCurlews, plovers. Hen harrier, if you\u2019re lucky. They even found a bog body, once. Remember that, Teasag?\u201d\nJessie doesn\u2019t.\n\u201cIn the museum down in Edinburgh, now, poor bairn. Thousands of years old. Miraculous. She was a human sacrifice, most likely.\u201d\nJack makes the mistake, later, of looking up bog bodies on his phone. The shrunken heads and stretched, bronze-like faces haunt his thoughts. He dreams of Innes shriveled and tanned black. Tiny fingers, fingernails, perfectly preserved in peat acid. He dreams of sinking alongside his son, bog water filling his own mouth. He wakes sweating and wants to retch, but Jessie is awake, as always, and he has to pull himself together. He reminds himself it is worse for her, more physical. In the evenings she fills up the old hot water bottle they found in a cupboard and sits with its quilted cover pressed across her stomach, across her leaking, aching breasts.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cBut we agreed.\u201d\n\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t know\u2026 Jessie, look at this place. We can\u2019t leave him here.\u201d\nHis voice breaks and he walks a few paces away, mindful not to stray off the path. The sunset music of the bog sings around him: low birdcalls, distant seagulls, drips and plops of frogs. He wants to crouch and hold his head and hurl angry words into the mud.\n\u201cJust a small piece, then,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cPeople do that. Have themselves scattered in all their favorite places, or in different countries. That\u2019s a thing.\u201d\nHe looks at her. Her eyes are bright, feverish with unshed tears. She needs to do this, for whatever reason.\nThere were so many times, when Innes was alive, that Jack wished he didn\u2019t exist. In the tiny hours, when the post-midnight wails sliced his sleeping brain apart, he would force himself out of bed to wipe and change and feed, a full day of work ahead of him, the whole time thinking, Why did we do this? Why can\u2019t we undo it? And he knows he didn\u2019t really mean it, he knows that, he\u2019s certain every new parent has these thoughts at one time or another, but the guilt sits heavy on his skull and his guts still clench with horror at himself.\nHe pulls in his breath and agrees.\nTogether, they scoop mud aside until a fragile hole forms in the peat. It fills instantly with water which is so cold and clear it might have come from another world. Jessie kisses the urn. She takes a pinch of Innes, between two fingers and thumb, and gently lets it fall. The ashes dissipate into the water. It\u2019s a moment of peace, a stillness settling over them, and he hugs Jessie to him with one arm as they crouch there in the darkening bog.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHe wakes Jessie, flashlight in one hand, saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you were right, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d She doesn\u2019t question. It\u2019s only as they\u2019re picking their way out into the night, Innes in his urn held to Jessie\u2019s stomach, that he realizes she really was asleep, properly, for the first time in weeks.\nThe hole is gone, so they dig another. Cold wet peat stains their hands. Jessie holds his shoulder as he empties the rest of Innes into the dark water, into the shine of flashlight, to sink from sight. Then he tips his head forward and shouts, a harsh ragged cry, and the night animals of the bog stir and murmur in response.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nJack finds his consciousness pulled continuously into the waters beyond the gravel bank. He can see Innes, sometimes, secure in the wet blackness as he was in the dark of the urn, in the dark of the womb. Sphagnum moss grows across his sky, a tapestry of thousands of plants interwoven, piling into hummocks and carpets and cushions. Whorl snails, tinier than Innes\u2019s toenails, creep between the fronds. The water which holds him contains ancient pollen grains and the fossilized stumps of trees and his father\u2019s left welly-boot. He floats among roots of bog asphodel, among the stems of sundews and butterworts, past the insects dying on their sticky leaves, and up into air with the skylarks and the marsh fritillaries. Jack and Jessie are with him. Together they have become part of this strange land. Unfamiliar words skim Jack\u2019s lips: riabhag, dealan-d\u00e9, seilcheag. The language drips into his skin like blood.\nHe goes round to Alain\u2019s farmhouse to return the key. Alain takes a long time to answer the door. When he does, the lonely blare of the television and the dusty smell of his hallway make him seem smaller, older, a hundred times older than Jack.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll hopefully be back some day,\u201d Jack says with a bright smile as he hands over the key.\nAlain gestures into the murk. \u201cYou live here long enough, lad, you come to learn that people never really leave.\u201d\nJack nods uneasily. He is very aware of Innes, or what remains of Innes, lost somewhere in the bog. The empty urn, which travelled here nestled on Jessie\u2019s lap in the passenger seat, is packed away, no longer meaningful. The guilt of this weighs on him. He suspects there are guilts which will always weigh on him.\nAs they drive away, Jessie leans her head into the window, letting the glass thrum against her skull. Jack can hear it. He can still hear the breath of the bog, even as it recedes into the distance behind them. He runs his tongue over the tiny weeds which grow in the hollow of his lower jaw. The satnav comforts him with repetitive orders: turn left, slight left, at the junction, keep right. He obeys. Outside, the ground is low, flat, watery. The road dips. They tarmac is puddled with brown water. Reeds wrap the axles, tiny snails wedge themselves into the cracks of the tires. Cuilcean. Seilcheagan. Jack is driving, a smile on his face, his wife\u2019s head thrumming against the window, and the further they go, the deeper they sink, into the heart of the bog.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue35\/3lbe35_story4.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"When you're already dead inside, Jack thinks, it shouldn't be possible for anything to make you feel worse.

His own mask lay long discarded in the back seat. Frank Riley rubbed the sweat and fine powder of the Texas earth from his tall forehead with a filthy handkerchief embroidered with the Pinkerton eye. In his other hand, he fidgeted thoughtlessly with his revolver. Webster hoped it wasn\u2019t loaded.\nTo Riley, it must have seemed just another dead town, entombed by the so-called Dust Bowl. To Webster, it represented another battle lost to the new desert that grew in America\u2019s heartland, a cancer as malignant as the one that had killed his wife. the last days! the end times! exclaimed the papers, though Webster wondered if he truly believed it, or even believed in god anymore, for that matter. What kind of Father, Son, or Holy Ghost would have made his darling Ginny suffer so unspeakably before she died?\nPushing away his anger and sorrow, he navigated the yellow-gray dunes that spilled across the road. The chains hanging from the back bumper clanked in a reassuring jangle, dispersing the static electricity that built-up in the dry air. That sort of thing could short out an engine, and it was a long walk back to the federal camp at Amarillo.\nThe sky clotted like a bruise to the west, though. Another Duster was coming, and they were headed right for it. All for a few stubborn farmers.\nTied to their land body and soul, large numbers of them refused to leave when President Roosevelt signed the Emergency Resettlement Act. Webster and Riley had found jobs with FRA to go out and persuade folks to move on, even to offer a little money. At least there was only one more farm to check on this trip, and then he and Riley could head home. Let the Army evacuate the rest.\n\u201cThey ain\u2019t gonna want to go,\u201d Riley said, as if reading his thoughts.\nWebster didn\u2019t think the reckless and stubborn Riley was much of an FRA man, but he was glad to have him along \u2014 especially after that farmer outside Dalhart had declined with a shotgun their invitation to resettle. The whole trip, Riley had watched the blowing Dust like he expected something to come out of it. Dozens of dime-sized scars puckered his sinewy arms, old wounds from the Great War. A skein of burst capillaries gave his flesh a raw look like spider bites that had never fully healed. Webster hesitated to ask Riley what he\u2019d tangled with back in France, but he suspected it was something much worse than a German soldier.\n\u201cMaybe they won\u2019t,\u201d Webster conceded, \u201cbut it\u2019s our duty to drive out there all the same.\u201d Working for the FRA was honest work, just like the President had promised. Every buck Webster earned out here on the road was another meal for his daughter Katy back in Amarillo. She was all he had left now. Her and the work. He\u2019d drive all over the Dust Bowl if it kept her fed and happy. And if he saved a few more lives along the way, that was gravy.\nTheir last stop, the Anderson farm, lay ten miles west of Pearceville; an easy trip before the storms. The FRA files said the Andersons had grown broomcorn and wheat, even had once had a little apple orchard. The papers listed four members of the family: james: 34, lillie: 31, jimmy jr.: 12, daisy: 9. She was Katy\u2019s age, and Webster imagined they looked alike. He couldn\u2019t bear the thought of Katy trapped on some desolate farm.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to convince them,\u201d Webster insisted, avoiding the burnt-out shell of a Model-A abandoned by the side of the road. A clump of dunes with a sign peeking out \u2014 danforth\u2019s dry goods \u2014 marked the edge of town.\n\u201cI got a revolver to protect you, not to force folks into the truck at gunpoint,\u201d Riley said, waving his gun. \u201cThat\u2019s what the Army\u2019s for.\u201d\nThe countryside flattened like a sun-struck anvil, and swirling devils of Dust escorted them from Pearceville. Webster picked up speed, gripping the wheel until his fingers turned white. He didn\u2019t share Riley\u2019s cynicism.\n\u201dWe\u2019re doing right by these people, Riley. We\u2019ve got to get them out for their own good.\u201d\nRiley thumbed the revolver and blew out Dust. \u201cI think folks got a right to sit in the dirt and die if that\u2019s what they want.\u201d\n\u201cBut they don\u2019t have to. The Resettlement Camps\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHey, friend. Don\u2019t get sore. I\u2019m gettin\u2019 paid, same as you. This work is better than strikebreakin\u2019 out in California, anyway.\u201d The Pinkerton dug a handful of bullets out of his jacket and rammed them one by one into the gun\u2019s cylinder.\nWebster caught the glint of a curling inscription on one of the bullets.\n\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d he asked.\nRiley shrugged. \u201cA good luck charm. There\u2019s worse \u2019n stubborn farmers out there. Didn\u2019t you read the field guide?\u201d\nWebster rolled his eyes. \u201cBoogey men?\u201d Riley\u2019s superstition rankled Webster.\n\u201cWe\u2019re goin\u2019 deeper into the Dust Bowl than we\u2019ve been before,\u201d Riley said. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever wonder what\u2019s causin\u2019 all of this?\u201d\n\u201cOverfarming. Erosion. Natural drought cycles.\u201d\n\u201cYou can believe the official story if you want, Webster. But I\u2019ve seen things I can\u2019t rightly account for.\u201d Riley patted the scars on his arm, then resumed his vigil over the desolation. Webster\u2019s shoulders ratcheted with a new unease.\nThe bleak carpet of the Texas wasteland unrolled before them. Intermittent dunes broke the desert, and half-buried farms jutted up from the soil like tombstones. As they drove west, the sky yellowed to an impenetrable haze. Webster pulled the headlight knob. It made seeing through the grit harder, but it would warn anyone coming from the other way. If anyone did. Sand blows danced in the pale beams. Some folks said if you stared long enough into the Dust, you would see the Devil himself. Maybe that\u2019s what Riley was talking about.\nA roadside sign floated out of the murk, hand-painted on a battered square of tin:\nturn back\nA lump thickened in the back of Webster\u2019s throat. He imagined Daisy Anderson, wild golden curls just like his Katy\u2019s, her stomach rumbling from a diet of canned tumbleweeds and Dust. He was determined to save her, to save her family, despite Riley\u2019s misgivings. Another sign appeared out of the haze.\nno god west of pearceville\n\u201cNot much east of it either,\u201d Riley grunted.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nRiley surveyed the dark house; the windows and doors were gaping, empty.\n\u201cThey\u2019re gone,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut their car\u2019s still here.\u201d Webster replied, pointing to an old Ford half-buried in a sand dune. \u201cWe should make sure.\u201d His hopes were fading, though.\nRiley sighed. \u201cOkay. Gotta stretch my legs and take a piss, anyway.\u201d He opened the door and slid out under the hammer of the afternoon sun.\nThe wind blew into the cab, salting the seat and floorboards with Dust. Webster reached across and pulled the door shut. Damn Riley. No manners. He left doors open. Used his handkerchief only to clean his gun. Helped himself to your ham steak if you weren\u2019t eating fast enough.\nWebster grabbed his goggles off the dashboard but left his mask. The Dust wasn\u2019t blowing that badly yet. He joined Riley outside.\n\u201cF.R.A.!\u201d he shouted. The land was wide open, but his voice bounced in his own ears like he was in a toilet stall. Sweat poured down his back and tickled the base of his spine as moments crept by without an answer. Nearby, Riley watered the dirt with a spume of piss. His dick in one hand, he fumbled for a cigarette with the other. Webster positioned himself upwind.\n\u201cTold ya no one\u2019s here,\u201d Riley said, buttoning his pants.\n\u201cI guess not.\u201d\nFrom the height of the dunes, he guessed no one had been here in a long time. He shivered from the sweat cooling in the small of his back, as the Dust swirled and settled around his ankles.\n\u201cIf there are bodies\u2026\u201d he trailed off, unable to finish the sentence. \u201cI\u2019ll check the house,\u201d he said and plodded through the Dust to fetch a flashlight from the back of the truck.\n\u201cWe should scram,\u201d Riley warned. He shielded a match against the wind and lit his cigarette. Blue puffs ringed his head as he surveyed the darkening sky. \u201cThen don\u2019t just stand there,\u201d Webster said, \u201cgo check the barn!\u201d\nRiley turned, fixing him with an ice-blue stare. \u201cYou some kinda general, now?\u201d he drawled, his voice flat.\nWebster pulled the flashlight from the truck, ignoring Riley\u2019s anger. He\u2019d be seeing Katy again soon and could forgive the man\u2019s mule headedness.\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying you\u2019re right, we should hurry,\u201d Webster said, flicking on the light. It glowed like a jaundiced eye, watery and anemic in the afternoon haze. He didn\u2019t like arguing with Riley, but thinking about finding bodies made him jittery.\nWith a shrug that said the argument wasn\u2019t over, Riley stalked off toward the barn, trailing tobacco plumes. To the northwest, the Dust thickened again, and the sun dimmed as if trapped in amber. It looked like that storm was on its way after all.\nHis throat tightened as he approached the open door of the house. Webster tensed, expecting to smell the rot of death, but to his relief he caught only the musty scent of earth and old ashes. He stabbed at the darkness with his flashlight. The interior of the house was a single room, dominated by an elephantine pot-bellied stove and the leaning wreck of a wooden bed frame. A dirt-stained flour sack dress lay crumpled near the door. A child\u2019s dress.\n\u201cWebster!\u201d Riley\u2019s shout was urgent.\nWebster backed away from the door and walked around the side of the house. Riley stood at the barn, waving both arms. Webster trudged over a dune, his stomach squirming. The wind picked up, sluicing Dust into his mouth.\n\u201cWhat you got?\u201d He coughed out gobbets of phlegm as dark as mud, wondering how he could have swallowed so much dirt already. He considered retrieving his mask from the truck, but Riley pointed him to a section of tin not completely covered by the earth.\nThis time, a faint reek of decay did sting Webster\u2019s nose. Worse, a pair of legs protruded from beneath the collapsed roof. They belonged to an adult, probably James, and the feet were bare, the skin drawn and smooth like shoe leather. In some places, the skin had worn away, and bone peeked out from the withered flesh.\n\u201cDamn,\u201d Webster said.\n\u201cGuess that\u2019s it,\u201d said Riley. He scanned the darkening northwestern sky where columns of reddish Dust swirled up from the earth like grasping fingers. Emerald flashes of heat lighting glimmered within, casting strange, twisting shadows. \u201cWe\u2019d better get out of here before that storm hits.\u201d\nWebster had never seen a Duster like the one that swelled on the horizon.\n\u201cBut we can\u2019t just leave them, Riley,\u201d he said. Decency gnawed at his conscience, despite the looming storm.\n\u201cSure we can. What good will it do to dig \u2019em out?\u201d\n\u201cDignity, man. It isn\u2019t right.\u201d Webster tugged on the sheet of tin, revealing another pair of feet. Smaller, but definitely adult. Lillie Anderson. The bones of her toes were exposed to the elements, held together only by dried-out tendons like beef jerky.\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t right they died this way, but we don\u2019t want to end up with Dust Pneumonia, either.\u201d Riley scratched the strange welts on his arm, his gaze on the storm.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t catching, Riley.\u201d Webster coughed again. He still mostly believed that. Now he really wished he had his mask.\nPrompted by the fingers of the gale, the soil stirred around them in a bilious ochre fog. Riley reconsidered his stance.\n\u201cAt least they get to stay on their farm,\u201d he mumbled.\n\u201cWe\u2019d better hurry. There\u2019s shovels in the truck.\u201d\nRiley flicked his cigarette butt away. \u201cI\u2019ll get \u2019em. And the masks.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThere was no sign of little Daisy and that lifted Webster\u2019s spirits.\n\u201cWe should look for her, too,\u201d he said as they were pelted with a fine prairie grit.\n\u201cWe only got time to bury these,\u201d Riley gestured to the grey shrouds.\nThe wind raked shrill across the bones of the Anderson farm and Webster had to reluctantly agree.\nThey managed to dig three shallow graves, though the Dust filled them nearly as quick as they were dug. To Webster\u2019s surprise, Riley suggested fashioning three crude crosses from barn scrap. He didn\u2019t object, but the sun dimmed as they hammered them together. It grew so quiet Webster could hear the thud of his heart as he worked.\nAs they placed the final cross for Jimmy Jr., the storm descended. The Dust blew sideways, driving at them like tiny knives. Webster yanked his goggles down while Riley struggled to pull on his cumbersome mask. The air detonated with emerald and violet bursts of static electricity that sizzled along curls of barbed wire, wriggling jewels sparkling on the blades of the windmill.\nWebster pulled on Riley\u2019s sleeve and hurried for the Dodge just as the truck \u2014 and everything else \u2014 vanished into the black heart of the storm. He felt around for his Dust mask, unable to tell if his eyes were even open. The grit clawed at the lenses of his goggles like ravenous insects. He clamped his mouth shut and held his sleeve over his face.\nThey stumbled around in the orange-black womb of the storm for what seemed like ages, until a sudden eddy of searing wind parted the Dust to reveal the long boxy shadow of the truck. Riley threw his arm in front of Webster as he tried to run to it. The other man\u2019s muffled cries were inaudible through the mask and shrieking storm, but he jabbed his finger urgently at the truck.\nA verdant blast of lightning tore open the shadows. Daisy Anderson appeared, hunched by the red FRA eagle logo painted on the truck door, the tatters of her flour-sack dress spread like ragged wings in the wind. Lank, straw colored hair grew in patches from the copper dome of her bald, peeling head. She squatted on legs as thin as the bug chewed fence posts. A monstrous green halo shimmered in the air around her.\nWebster jumped ahead of Riley, a pang of joy thrilling his heart. She was alive!\nToo late, then, he saw the complete ruin of Daisy\u2019s eyes, glued blind by the Dust.\nLightning, grasping and green, crackled from her blind eyes. The bolts sent Webster flying backward, banners of green fire trailing at the edge of his vision. Riley shouted somewhere far off, and there came the dense thud of gunshots. The Dust surged in again, parting his lips and smothering his breath like a ravenous lover. Oblivion found him while he gasped for air.\nHe dreamed of his straw-tressed Katy in the darkness.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHe coughed. The black taste of the Dust parched his tongue. He ground his teeth over a coating of grit. As his eyes adjusted to the dimness, he saw the Anderson family circled around him; static sparks flickering like fireflies across their leathery skin. They watched him with the shriveled pits of their sightless eyes.\n\u201cOh god,\u201d he gasped, an odd, heaving breath tearing him fully awake. He lay in the sod house, spread-eagle on the ruined bed. Riley was nowhere to be found. Panic crushed his ribs as he forced himself to look at the Andersons. Whatever made them that way, it sure as hell wasn\u2019t Dust Pneumonia.\nDaisy Anderson walked her tiny fingers across three bullet holes in her sparrow chest. She sang a nursery rhyme while she counted the wounds. Or at least Webster reckoned the air wheezing from her shriveled lips was a song. From her wounds bled something like a mixture of molasses and Dust. Her father leaned forward. More sand tumbled from his mouth and lidded eyes. His whispers knifed their way into Webster\u2019s soul.\nWebster\u2019s bowels churned. He couldn\u2019t understand a word of the man\u2019s gibberish. He eyed the open door beyond the Andersons and wondered if he could outrun them.\nJimmy Jr. fidgeted, peeling a strip of skin from the back of his hand. Lillie Anderson patted her husband\u2019s shoulder, and then patted the ground. Part of her forehead flurried away as she gave an emphatic shake of her head.\n\u201cN\u2014no,\u201d Webster said, catching on. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make you leave.\u201d\nJimmy Jr. laughed, a blat of air like a punctured tire. He mimed tying a knot around Webster\u2019s neck.\nWebster flinched back on the bed. Good lord, they didn\u2019t expect him to stay here?\n\u201cFolks got a right to sit in the dirt,\u201d Riley said, appearing in the doorway.\nRelief poured through him like a cold drink of water.\n\u201cJeeze, Riley, I thought you were dead. Let\u2019s get the hell out\u2014\u201d but his words just stopped when he saw the emeralds of Riley\u2019s eyes sparkling in the dark.\nRiley waved a hand at the Dust-preserved farmer and his family.\n\u201cAm I right?\u201d\nJames and Lillie nodded, the leathery tendons of their jaws creaking.\n\u201cRiley, what happened to you?\u201d\n\u201cLike I said, Dust can change you. Reckon it caught up to me.\u201d\nWebster looked away when Riley extended his hands, fresh lightning scars rippling up his bare forearms.\n\u201cOh god. Just let me go, please. Katy\u2019s waiting for me back in Amarillo.\u201d He hadn\u2019t begged for anything since Ginny died, but he begged for Katy now. He struggled to picture her. He only saw Daisy when he squeezed shut his paper-lidded eyes.\n\u201cSo go see her, you still got some time. I ain\u2019t stoppin\u2019 you,\u201d said Riley.\nRiley stepped out the door and the Andersons followed in single file. James\u2019 eyeless face drooped in sorrow, though, and Lillie smoothed the tatters of her apron, leaving behind flakes of sun-browned skin. Jimmy Jr. just shrugged. Only Daisy turned to him as Webster leapt up from the bed and rushed out of the house. He stumbled through the door into the amber gloom of the farmstead.\nRiley stood between him and the truck, his feet planted wide like the broken windmill.\n\u201cDon. You can go, but the Dust\u2019s got into you. It might draw you back.\u201d\n\u201cBut this isn\u2019t my land,\u201d Webster protested.\n\u201cWe all got a stake in what\u2019s happenin\u2019 here, Don. You should go convince folks of that.\u201d\nWebster\u2019s thoughts clouded with visions of more Dust, spreading out past Texas, to Arkansas, Tennessee. North Carolina. Maybe even to Washington D.C. He gagged and spat out more of the gooey mud. If he was sick with something worse than Dust Pneumonia, then he should stay here. Keep away from Katy. It was the right thing to do.\nWasn\u2019t it?\nDaisy shambled forward, her stringy hair drifting in knotted clumps on the steady wind. She grabbed hold of Webster\u2019s leg, hugging him tight.\nRiley sighed.\n\u201cIf you come back \u2014 Daisy really wants a sister.\u201d\nWebster yelped like a beaten dog, lurching towards the truck and sending Daisy sprawling to the dirt. The wind howled in a cyclonic frenzy, and the blowing grit threatened to sand his skin from his bones. Or polish it bronze. Webster didn\u2019t feel it, though, he only thought of seeing his daughter again.\nHe scrambled into the truck, and thank god it started when he pressed the ignition. He dimly saw the Andersons by their door as he raced away from the farm. Riley\u2019s eyes gleamed like emerald fireflies in the gathering Dust.\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he mumbled to no one. But he didn\u2019t look back; Katy waited for him at home.\nAs he passed back through Pearceville, the sky cleared. Webster could almost believe he\u2019d imagined the farm and its tenants. Giddy, he told himself the storm\u2019s static shock had jolted his brain. He\u2019d dreamed it all. Riley would be all right. He\u2019d wander back to Amarillo sore as hell, but when wasn\u2019t Riley sore about something?\nWebster rolled down the windows, the dry tips of his fingers tingling. He coughed, dribbling sand and mud down his chin, even as more Dust blew into the cab from the ruined town. If he could just make it to Amarillo, everything would be fine. Once he and Katy were together again, not even the Dust could separate them.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue24\/3lbe24_story4.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"The empty eyes of crumbling storefronts watched as a black, early-model Dodge panel truck inched through the sand-blown ruin that had been Pearceville, Texas.

This tower was just the tallest of many now, their sharp spikes piercing through insectile light, which pulsed with uneven, wretched beats from various obsessive locations within the city. From the distance at which the wolf and the girl stood, a kind of buzz could be heard, like a power line, humming and chortling, rising from scattered pockets of alien corruption.\nA meteor moved between moon and planet \u2014 a sword stroke through the stars.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have much longer now,\u201d the wolf said.\nSylvy rubbed her eyes with the heels of her hands. There was no time to rest. She must rest.\n\u201cYou never sleep,\u201d she accused the wolf next to her, \u201cWhy don't you ever sleep?\u201d\nThe wolf blinked. \u201cEverybody knows wolves don't sleep.\u201d\n\u201cEverybody knows \u2026 \u201d Sylvy muttered as she pulled a small, velvet pouch from a pocket that also held two jawbreakers, a round patch with a depiction of the historic X-B12 space shuttle sewn into it, and a ticket stub to the Summit County Fair. \u201cWhat do you know about wolves. You're not even really a wolf, Wolf.\u201d She walked forward ten paces and nestled House into place then ran back to the leafless copse of trees from which they had emerged.\n\u201cThat's true. I'm a guide, as I've told you many times before now.\u201d\nHouse doubled then tripled in size, growing through dollhouse size, treehouse size; arriving finally at small human size with a gentle pop and the smell of smoky peat.\n\u201cYou're a hallucination. A glorified alarm clock.\u201d\n\u201cI'm an interface.\u201d\n\u201cA lie.\u201d\nToday House had three windows instead of two and its front door was arched at the top. Sylvy stepped past the front gate and patted the post.\nThe wolf followed.\nThe light in the house was a creamy caramel. Sylvy knew House kept it that way because it was the optimal color and intensity and reminded Sylvy of home. She sat on the rough bench in front of the counter and took off her muddy boots, groaning with pleasure as she stretched her toes. When was the last time she had taken the things off? She couldn\u2019t remember. A PB&J sandwich was waiting on a plate next to a steaming cup of tea that smelled of peppermint and chamomile. Sylvy stuck her face in the steam and inhaled.\nIn the far distance, a piece of the tower groaned and fell; the fragile china in the cabinets shivered and shook. The wolf made itself comfortable in an overstuffed armchair and lay its muzzle on its paws.\nSylvy paused to listen. No further cracks or snaps invaded the silence of the night. She demolished half the sandwich and sat listening to the clock purring through the minutes, hours, all the unraveled and uncounted eternities that spring up between each tick, until across the room, light began to weasel through the crack under the front door. She could see it prying at the space between the jam and the wall, reaching across the boards of the small room. It twitched at regular intervals, as if interrupted by someone pacing in front of it with even, unheard steps.\nFlicker, flicker, flicker, pause. Flicker, flicker, flicker, pause.\nSylvy drank the last bitter remains of her tea.\n\u201cWe're almost there. We'll find her,\u201d she said into the cup.\nThe wolf smiled its great marauding smile. It was agreeing. It was laughing.\n\u201cYou know that's not what we're here for, Doctor.\u201d\n\u201cDon't call me that. I've told you a thousand times.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I've told you \u2014 we're not here for your sister.\u201d\n\u201cI know that, too.\u201d Sylvy stood.\n\u201cDo you? Do you remember why we are here? You were chosen for a reason, but that reason is as dangerous as it is beneficial. This apparition you are chasing is a side effect of communication. To interface with the patient a door had to be opened.\u201d\nSylvy touched her toes to the floor then pulled them back like a swimmer testing the water. The floor was warm and smooth. Her feet made swishy noises as she shuffled to the threshold of the room, making sure no part of her touched the light.\nFlick, flick, flick, pause, flick, flick, flick, pause.\n\u201cI used to tell my bad dreams to Vic, and she would make up an ending to the dream where everything turned out okay,\u201d Sylvy told the wolf.\nThe wolf stretched, like a runner at the blocks, then leapt down.\n\u201cThis isn't helping,\u201d it said.\nSylvy's lips tightened; she cleared her throat, \u201cYou wolves are always interrupting people.\u201d\nSniffing indignantly, the wolf walked to the front door.\n\u201cAnyways, Vic was going to be a race car driver and an interstellar spaceship captain and the world\u2019s best pancake cooker. I was going to be her pit boss and her engineer and the world\u2019s best pancake taster. After school she would make these pancake sandwiches on the little electric griddle while we listened to the Shangri Las sing \u2018I\u2019ll Never Learn.\u2019 Mom would come home and she would braid our hair for bed, and Vic would tell me stories. That's how it was \u2026 before.\u201d\nSylvy stopped, considering the light still flicking its fingers across the floor. Shadows ran and rippled up the walls, as if at an indoor pool. The wavering light distorted the wolf's face, making its mouth snarl.\nSomething outside squealed, there was a pop and the walls shuddered.\nSylvy frowned. \u201cThat was fast. I don't think it's ever found us this fast before.\u201d\n\u201cNo, never so fast,\u201d the wolf agreed, prowling at the door.\n\u201cWe're close now, though. We have a chance. Let's go, House,\u201d she commanded. On the opposite side of the room a lintel grew out of the floor and a door to match, much smaller than the one at the front, grew with it. Sylvy sat down and pulled her boots on. They smelled like leather and wool and mud.\n\u201cYes, close, very close \u2026 but the city, it is also close, very close,\u201d the wolf continued to stare at the illuminated threshold. Sylvy yanked a navy peacoat off the hook beside the little red door.\n\u201cWell, then we had better be fast \u2014 very, very fast,\u201d she said, and swung the small door open, crawling through on hands and knees.\nFlickering torches lit the corridor beyond. Scents of summer swept through, reminding Sylvy of the big, drooping purple flowers that filled her Grandmother\u2019s garden in Florida where she and Vic had explored the ruins of the old launch pads, skipping past no trespassing signs and broken heaps of sharp, corroded metal. She rose and stepped onto the cold stone floor, leaving behind the warmth of House. The wolf padded past her, down the corridor, to an arch outlined by starlight.\nSylvy turned and held out her hand, \u201cC'mon, House,\u201d she called. The little red door squealed then popped off its hinges as the frame around it began to shrink. Within seconds House had reduced itself to the size of a charm and sat hot and panting in her hand. She slid House back in its pouch, letting it circle around until it settled down, then tucked the pouch into her coat pocket.\nThrough the arch, red roses dripped from green foliage, eating up walls and colonnades. Above, the sky was smothered in its usual deep purple. At the center of the courtyard stood a circle of hedge animals \u2014 zebras, unicorns, mammoths, a leaping tiger.\nThe tiger\u2019s mouth was open. Its eyes gleamed like the slick, black carapace of some giant beetle. The wolf sniffed the air. The tiger's mouth snapped shut; it shifted into a crouch. \u201cTrespasser,\u201d it growled with a voice of rustling leaves and scratching twigs, \u201cwe\u2019ve told you, we don\u2019t want your help. You will be expelled.\u201d\nSylvy placed her hand on the deep ruff of the wolf's neck, and with a springing step launched herself onto the wolf's back.\nThe tiger pounced.\nThey dodged to the left and shot forward, diving through the circled animals. Sylvy grabbed two fistfuls of fur at the wolf\u2019s neck, ducking as branches slapped at her face and arms. They left the courtyard, leaping through an arch and turning a sharp right.\nTwigs cracked and snapped.\nA terrible, squealing scream pursued them.\n\u201cWe have to get across the bridge,\u201d the wolf rasped.\n\u201cWhat bridge,\u201d Sylvy asked, even as the ground to either side of them fell.\nPavement cracked and became a cobbled path. They rushed forward; the path rose.\nSylvy\u2019s stomach heaved. She flexed her sweating hands. Rumbles of thunder boomed from all directions as water exploded from aqueducts on either side of the bridge that assembled itself even as they raced over its slender surface.\nThrough the grate of the bridge, she saw the seething surface of the city below. The roofs of the houses shivered, timbers growing upward. A three-story Victorian unfurled, gables and cupolas reaching toward them. A weather vane\u2019s point scraped the underside of Sylvy's foot. Behind them the sounds of cracking branches and pointy howls grew closer.\nThey were running out of bridge. Its ragged, self-constructing edge was now only feet away. Ahead, the spire of a high-rise stabbed at the sky. Windows thundered upward in an indistinguishable blur like boxes on a roulette wheel.\nThey were going to slam right into it.\nHoly Fish Flipping Christ, Sylvy thought, and felt a strange, wild satisfaction at using her mother\u2019s most forbidden curse.\nThey leapt through the air.\nWe\u2019re not going to make it \u2026\nGlass breaking. Colors bending. Wet wool.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nGlass crunched. The wolf stood next to her, red tongue hanging from a mouth full of white, sharp teeth. Yellow eyes, the size of Sylvy\u2019s fist, reflected a frightened young woman, maybe fourteen or fifteen, hair sparkling with glass.\nThe room they crashed into stretched to the vanishing point on the left and right. Bookcases towered from floor to ceiling. Lines of colorful, gilt spines were punctuated by decorative apocrypha.\n\u201cWell, that was fun.\u201d Sylvy brushed tiny shards of glass from her clothes with shaking hands and checked to make sure House was okay.\nThe wolf frowned at her.\n\u201cDoctor\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know, I know, this is my brain on drugs.\u201d\n\u201cNot your brain\u2014\u201d\n\u201c \u2014 an interface representing the mapping between my brain and the patient \u2026 on drugs. I know.\u201d\n\u201cListen to me.\u201d The wolf sniffed at the air. \u201cWe must eradicate this grief and --\u201d\nSylvy looked out over the ruined city. \u201cYou think this is just some neat little bit of code run amok, some circuit gone wrong, that we can snip out? Some switch we can turn off? Spoken like a true interface.\u201d The wolf made a sound like a sigh, even though everyone knows wolves don't sigh.\n\u201cThe sister you chase is a defense \u2014 an effort to distract you from your task.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Sylvy said, \u201cbut it doesn't make me want to see her any less.\u201d\nShe chose the left wing and began walking.\nThey passed lines of books with titles like The Rise and Fall of the Lunar Empire, Beatles Flew From Her Eyes, and The Terrible Reign of Nikola Tesla III, all bound and gilt, punctuated by wooden boxes, stone sculptures, framed maps, curling horns, the mounted head of something that looked like a cross between a buffalo and a cockroach. The wolf's claws clicked on the granite floor. After ten minutes of walking they came to the corridor\u2019s end. It was terminated by an atrium housing a representation of the Izanagi system, with its three orbiting planets and two moons circling a sun only slightly larger than Earth\u2019s own.\nA round window framed the slowly twirling model. Through it a sluggish and yellowed light entered, as if cast by gas lamp or anemic sun. On the opposite side of the room, a telescope sat pointed toward a postage stamp-sized window in the floor.\nSylvy paused and walked over to it. \u201cVic had one just like this,\u201d she ran her hand over the cylindrical surface. \u201cMy mother gave it to her on her sixteenth birthday. When we all still thought she was leaving, joining the service, wandering out into space like she always dreamed, like she always wanted.\u201d\nSylvy squinted into the eyepiece of the telescope. Through the curving, lensed image she could see the universe at the bottom of a well slick with stars. It was so big, and Sylvy was very small.\n\u201cTell me what a wolf wants, Wolf.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a wolf wants \u2026 a wolf wants wind and dirt and the taste of the unrevised moment, a wolf wants the stars to stare forever, a wolf wants to be free, and a wolf wants the moving muscle and common breaths of its brothers.\u201d\nSylvy looked away from the eyepiece, but her head stayed bowed.\n\u201cWe know you grieve. We know you suffer.\u201d\n\u201cSuffering?\u201d The wolf mused, \u201cYou're lying on a couch in the belly of a great ship, only your mind is here, forming some approximation of yourself. Izanagi is gone. I am alone now.\u201d\nSylvy swung the telescope around and focused on a book open on a pedestal across the room. She read the first sentence of the first page: \u201cEmpathy was missing from the first technologies \u2014 so many centuries ago. Survival instinct. The things that make machines compatible with human life, so we gave the planet-city sentience, life as we knew it.\u201d\nShe straightened, looking at the ball of blue-green azurite malachite that swung around a much larger sphere of orange agate.\n\u201cLife as we knew it,\u201d she repeated. \u201cAnd with that life \u2014 death. Wolves, Izanagi, my sister, even me \u2014 despite synth and all the eons it has given us. Most beings in our era have never experienced death. Only those few ancients who survive from the Systems Era, can begin to comprehend such a thing.\u201d\nHer voice was quiet in the enormity of the domed room.\n\u201cEven you, Keeper of Systems, City-planet Izanami, last of your kind \u2026 someday, but it doesn\u2019t have to be now.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cDown there?\u201d Sylvy asked.\n\u201cDown there,\u201d the wolf said. \u201cHop on.\u201d\nThey ran across slate and straw and terracotta. They darted around smoke stacks and rusty weather vanes and big metal antennas. They leapt across small gaps hung with clotheslines and large gaps with alleys that bucked and heaved. They rounded a green, copper dome; figures towered at its cardinal coordinates, offering their shadows for concealment. Up onto an intricately carved balustrade; down the head of a marble jade emperor; hop onto a shoulder. The street was only stories away. Arm to knee, then a fast slide down a fold in the robes to the ground.\nThey twisted between aluminum trailers with doors hanging open. They ducked under a fallen street light whose dying breath revealed a path strewn with jumbled cars. Ahead, a red flag snapped sharp in the wind, and Sylvy knew what they would see the moment they rounded a pile of twisted metal gathered at the base of a crenellated watchtower.\nShe knew it.\nBut there was only a road.\nThe wolf slowed to a walk and stopped at its asphalt edge.\nSylvy slid down the wolf's back. The road stretched either direction. They were alone now in a flat prairie that spread unending around them. At the horizon, light limned the curve of Izanami's surface. Sylvy stepped forward onto the tar black asphalt. Her movements felt slow and deliberate. She stood in the middle of the road, her legs straddling the yellow stitches that cleaved its rough skin in half.\nUp ahead something was struggling. Its front legs twitched pitifully as it continued to try to run away, to escape the ill fortune which had already befallen it.\nIt was a wolf.\nSylvy looked behind her. There was only the empty prairie. She walked forward and fell to her knees. In the cold of the night, the pavement was warm and biting. She placed a trembling hand on the wolf's neck. It struggled weakly to lift its head and bite her.\nAnother hand reached forward, stilling the helpless thing\u2019s efforts.\n\u201cI'm sorry, Little Sister.\u201d Vic knelt on the other side of the dying animal. She looked as she always had to Sylvy in life and memory \u2014 seventeen, wild within the world, the mass of mahogany hair, her mouth a relaxed question mark turned sideways.\n\u201cThis is it, isn't it? This is the moment of decision. When you decided to give up after that transport hit you. When you decided it was too hard.\u201d\nHer sister reached over and squeezed Sylvy's shoulder. Sylvy shrugged it off.\n\u201cDon't. I'm not here for your apologies. I'm older. I have other business to attend to now.\u201d\n\u201cThat's right, you're a doctor,\u201d she said. \u201cDoctor of Psychological Systems Engineering \u2026 who could have thought we would go to space this way? After all the dreams of joining the service, all the dreams of us flying together. Remember how we would sneak out to see the launches?\u201d\nHer square fingered, capable hand stroked the wolf\u2019s ear.\n\u201cYou were such a fearless kid. I would pull you up and lower you down that huge concrete fence, and you weren\u2019t scared at all \u2014 you loved it and we would sit on the little hill where no one could see us, watching the lights, listening to the command center on our metas until the ship took off.\u201d\nAll the anger Sylvy hadn't even known she felt rose up inside, tumbling out. She knew it was a distraction to the task at hand, but was as helpless before it as in the face of a meteor falling into a planet. \u201cYou left me. You were supposed to be my big sister. You were supposed to look after me, instead you were just a selfish asshole.\u201d\nShe leaned forward, \u201cSo screw you.\u201d and finding that unsatisfactory, she reached for some other phrase with which to express her fury and found only the classic of their childhood. \u201cScrew you and the horse you rode in on.\u201d\nVic\u2019s eyebrows quirked upward, then they were both giggling, then they were both laughing. The great whooping gusts escaped and they laughed just as they had when they sat in their blanket fort looking at one of father\u2019s magazines and trying to imagine what was going on; just as they had when their first model rocket had ignited and then immediately fizzled and fallen on its side; just as they always had.\nThe wolf squirmed beneath their hands and the laughter died.\nSylvy drew in a breath. \u201cI miss you, still \u2026 still after all this time.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019re not really my sister. You picked this moment from my life, from my memory. You chose my sister.\u201d\nSylvy did what she had wanted to do that night, when her sister was seventeen and running away, heartbroken, dreamstolen, to the city, and she was twelve and determined to follow and could do nothing to help when her sister lay on this road, she leaned down and kissed the wolf tenderly on the forehead.\nHer sister's warm breath was on her cheek. It smelled alive, like an apple being bitten into.\n\u201cSylvy?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cYou remember the launches don't you?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWe were happy then.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d\n\u201cI know. I\u2019m here.\u201d\nThe wolf\u2019s round, golden eyes closed. Two sisters walked toward the city under the bones of a drifting moon.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue28\/3lbe28_story2.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"The doctor turned to watch the great baroque tower falter and sway.

My eyes traced the thin blue stems growing in perfect circles, the thorny tips biting at their sprouting points, the onyx petals growing around their circumference. At once I recognized God\u2019s sign: ouroboros. I devoured the information on the plant\u2019s properties and all my apprehension melted away. I said yes to the project \u2014 not that after thirty years with the company I\u2019d get away with an easy no \u2014 and the manager produced an ugly grin. \u201cMake us new fantasies, Mr. Reyes Terron,\u201d they said, \u201cMake this the island of enchantment again.\u201d And I left, eager to comply.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI sat on one of the few surviving street benches in what had been Arecibo\u2019s town square, looking at the buildings half-swallowed by the Atlantic. The tide was high and I saw gray waves move through the broken doors and shattered windows. I wondered again if the tenants of those buildings had escaped before the flood. Above me, latched on to their roofs, the giant screens promoted the newest exhibition to the tourists, some obscene looking blob and a feathered primate.\nI thought of the flowers and I wanted to tell someone my good news, but the plaza was empty. With no attractions there were no guests and no money, and so no one lived there, only the four-eyed grackles scavenging the garbage. I re-read the files.\nThe plants were fascinating. Found under the last rumps of arctic ice, they used neutrinos as a secondary source of energy and adapted mineral compounds to reproduce, but it was their secretions that caught the company\u2019s attention. The flower\u2019s nectar could be synthesized into a genetic glue which allowed for all kinds of molecular combinations that were typically unstable \u2014 or downright impossible \u2014 under known mechanisms. A golden discovery for a company whose biological attractions were less and less popular each year, and losing the battle for the public\u2019s attention to the lunar colonies trend. Most of the initial work had already been done in simple organisms, and now the company needed an experienced hand to guide them through more complex structures.\nI thought about my family, the underground habitats where the company grew the exhibitions before displaying them, and the old story of people originating from the island caves. I thanked God knowing I would provide a rebirth for my home \u2014 a garden to survive all things.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nLeaving the building I ventured to the nearest exhibitions on display, avoiding the scant groups of tourists. I\u2019d hoped to find inspiration, maybe see one of my designs still in use, but nothing felt right. Everything appeared mundane, lackluster, boring. Where was the divine spark of life? I couldn\u2019t feel it in or around me. I rolled my eyes at the trite amalgamations, at the giant animals, at other fictions made \u201creal.\u201d When I finally found an older project among the exhibits, the skeletal jellyfish, I scoffed at myself knowing I had taken the idea from a book. Copies of copies of a copy, everything seemed tired and meek, like all zoos. My notes for new designs felt hopeless, fruitless\nThe heartless criticisms from management still rang in my mind. It was always the same, no matter how much you worked, no matter how persistent and loyal you were, they always wanted more from you. I hated the company, detested everything about it, but that was the only thing I had left, God\u2019s last chance for me. I hadn\u2019t realized how far I\u2019d been pushed into the pit of despair, or how deeply it had nullified my spirit. My days of idealism were gone, dead as my hopes of advancing the field, of becoming a big name in the company, that they might relent their older patents for medical research, for food development, humanitarian services \u2014 anything but monster-of-the-month attractions and cheap pets pre-designed to die in a few weeks. What a naive dream I\u2019d lived. The company was doing exactly what it had been built to do, like a virus sucking the life from its host. Now was the time to survive.\nOn my walk between those luxurious decaying buildings I tried to recall what had inspired me before \u2014 truly inspired me. I saw remnants of a concrete wall near the great Arecibo River, its rising waters washing away the ancient Spanish buildings, the 20th century stores, and the asphalt at my feet. I took in the soul of that place, a boundary between the old and new. I thought of physics; how the universe had turned itself from the chaos of pure motion to life. Beautiful life, as complicated and complex as the components which had birthed it.\n\u201cThere was God,\u201d I often told my grandfather, the part-time preacher, and he agreed.\nI was the same age he had been when I\u2019d been born. I recalled him taking me around the island to visit the attractions while my parents were away at some job or other. I thought of the old video he kept in his phone from when they rolled out the first dragon. It had simply been an enlarged Komodo dragon with useless wings, ox horns, and peacock feathers for a mane \u2014 though, I\u2019ll admit, giving it a lion's roar had been a stroke of genius \u2014 we still used that same sequence. At the end of its act the animal would climb onto a golden ball, arch its body, spread its wings, and bite its own tail. Even through his phone\u2019s distortions one could hear the wild cheering of the crowd, my grandfather's own elated youthful shouting. It was that ouroboros which drew my imagination to the science of the company.\nAs I grew older I wondered why he went to see the attractions unlike grandmother. Later I learned they had earned her hate when the bailout from the company effectively made all citizens tenants of the park. \u2018Enchanted Island: Where fantasy lives.\u2019 After that there were no more new residences built on the island, and the only employment for those who remained was with the company. Whenever I\u2019d ask him about it, he\u2019d smile, shrug, and say, \u201cThat\u2019s how life\u2019s always been, those in power use their power. I\u2019m just trying to survive, make sure my children and my grandchildren are safe, fed, and happy. That\u2019s why God put me on this Earth.\u201d\nBut what did happiness have to do with it? I couldn\u2019t see it anymore. Did the little black birds scavenging the roads and trash contemplate emotion? It\u2019s survival, all of it. Survival to feel a sliver of security under pressures beyond your power to change: that was happiness in our island. Here on Earth\u2019s fragile shell, floating in the voids and subject to its currents, is our test for being God's children: to survive. No arbitrary ethics, no inner understanding beyond this primal dictate: survive, survive, survive. Just as my grandparents had managed to escape those massive drownings, working every day until they died. Though not before that they saw us off to college, the last children of the island.\nSurvive, that was all that mattered; within the company, without it. The flower would unlock my dream: an island brimming with life, not meandering old men, not the rich and their playthings. I simply needed more room to breathe, more room to experiment. Then, like a fever, I was struck by the wisdom of the self-eating snake. The insight flashed before me, so obvious now, like forgotten knowledge fully digested: all beginnings come from an end. For my new world to be properly born the previous one had to burn. I felt the divine spark in me, guiding me, I would create to destroy to create. Through those cycles of life and death, new and beautiful survivors would arise. Like God had always done.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThus, when the expendable old man who mumbled old ideas requested a few extra easily programmable service robots to help him around the lab, no one looked twice. The robots were the actual teams responsible for cleaning the guest areas, maintaining the habitats, and producing new attractions under human guidance. After a quick modding of their GPS and security links they were ready to be my helping angels.\nThree weeks after my second progress report \u2014 spent in half-hearted explanations to an obvious replacement \u2014 I had at my disposal a secret second habitat. It was two floors below my official one and connected through an unused staircase via a section which had been permanently closed off for canceled renovation. It was fairly standard: development tanks and sacks, complete weather control and terraforming, and radiation gradients. Little by little my robots took the needed resources down and prepared them for me.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMy selected species were based on evolution, playing to the harmonies of nature, but an artistic spirit also commanded my hand. I felt as a poet in the throws of ecstatic inspiration, knowing that from the blood of my makeshift aliens, dragons, and dinosaurs something new would arise. With enough of my old models installed, I began incorporating other codes, some from nature, improving them as I saw fit, and some made rather spontaneously. Some had to be adjusted and reintroduced, some removed from the balancing act, some favored.\nLastly, to all my children, I gave the truest marvel of the flowers, one I was careful never to disclose: control of aging. Altering it for the greater design; I, and I alone, had found a method to maximize evolution. Once it was all set and done, I let time run its course.\nI wondered if perhaps God encoded in us arbitrary functions for their own convenience \u2014 yes, I decided, perhaps the soul.\nIn six months a beautiful genesis occurred. My heart went out to those feathered mammals running from the arthropod-like things hunting them. I gazed for hours at the habits of an odd type of worm which had developed appendages and eyes, amazed as it rose to become the dominant lifeform. In the rivers, fish haunted amphibians and the amphibians grew to hunt them. The flora developed a taste for the traditional gasses and minerals and light, but also incorporated the flower\u2019s peculiarity for neutrinos.\nIt was around the tenth month that I decided a first apocalypse was in order. I began with fire and ash using the radiation gradients. After averaging certain ecosystems and food webs in certain habitats, I made it burn like a never-ending summer.\nWhat was I aiming for exactly? To be completely honest, I had no idea. Again I\u2019d let my artistic expression take over my decisions. Though as most artists will tell you, perhaps my body knew something my conscious mind did not as I warmed their land and sea. And so my beautiful yet familiar prologue came to an end. I decided to let the next world be defined by water. I had almost made the mistake of lowering the temperatures without first giving the survivors time to adapt.\nThough it would not be long before I discovered my true error: the process would take too long. I had calculated my rations to last for a year, but even funneling natural selection everything would take years. I\u2019d cued my resignation letter to send automatically after three months. I couldn\u2019t risk leaving the habitat, a wandering tourist or robot or employee might see me, even the service exits of the tunnels were too risky. Sending the re-programmed robot was an even bigger risk, it might connect to the shared network. No, it would\u2019ve un-made everything.\nI prayed and meditated for days. I went to the garden for some clarity and as I laid on the velvet grass my grandfather\u2019s words came back to me, \u201cTo survive and make sure my children are happy. Why God put me on this Earth.\u201d\nNow revelation came as a breeze, it was simple really, I would use the flowers on myself. Not flagrantly, not impudently, but just enough that my body would produce its own sustenance, like a plant. It took a few days of focused planning and simulations, dedicating and modifying one of the growing modules for myself. I left the shuffling genesis and apocalypses in the hands of a simple AI while I went through the procedure. The last thing I saw before my current state was the dropping oxygen levels of that second world, the beginning of its end.\nI dreamed of the stars and the earth and the ouroboros and its infinite abstractions; of not merely conversation of energy, but reality itself, transcendental, infinitely fractured in harmonies and sprouting tones we can\u2019t \u2014 and will never \u2014 understand. I dreamed the flowers spoke to me, sang to me. And when I awoke, oh delicious return, I recognized nothing.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHow that initial transfusion left me perpetually elated? How I went to the garden and savored the light and air in ways that made other tastes blunt and insulting? How my eyes saw what lives underneath shades and shadows? Or that soon after my muscles stiffened as my skin turned green and I began to rely on the AI\u2019s voice command? Or that is why in the fifth world I desired to walk among my children and made my lower body akin to a cockroach, able to move without much of a mind.\nIn the sixth world I beheld the most beautiful creatures. Small fibrous hexapods tangentially related to those now extinct feathered mammals, curious odd things resembling cephalopods perfectly suited for deserts, above them the birds that could not be. Oh, the colors made by the flora, the aromas, the velvet orchidians, changing color with temperature, the embracing thorns of those that became carnivores. If the samples are to be believed, some of them are able to naturally produce the flower's secretions. They even grew in the same way: lapis-lazuli skin, purple thorns, and circular branches \u2014 though their petals are crimson colored.\nHow did all this come about? I have no idea. Sure enough my hand guided, but I knew not the direction, nor what chance and luck has granted those that survived since the beginning. Now I think neither did God and that is why they had died. Changing themselves so materially, so drastically, to be in our garden. A place suited only for their children, and so the divine body merely crumbled and decayed to feed its worms. Always worms, even now.\nWhat to say? My memories feel vague lately, my body feels apart from myself. Shared, as if another life is developing alongside mine. I welcome it.\nHow long since I began? I made myself live long and forgot, silly me.\nI will go now. To be with my children. I wish to feed my worms. Let them have me, all of me. Perhaps I shall be reborn. I have instructed my helpers to call on the company. Even if a hundred years have passed there is always a company. Let them have me too, all of me. My vision, my garden; my sprawling chimeric dream.\nThey will turn it all into an exhibition, I know it. An exhibition born out of death, made to survive and change and spread and survive in ways they will not predict. I love them, my children, wild and free. They\u2019ll take the island, I know it. Like the old myths, its new people will come from below, from the caves, to make our seventh world.\n\u2022\nFront & Back cover art by Rew X\n\u2022\nJulie Ireland\nBear Weiter\nKelly L.\nJessica Guptill\nThomas Ha\nMaria Haskins\nLorna D.

You were sitting on my couch like you belonged there.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I asked, wobbling, holding my key out at you like a weapon.\nAndrew stood in the doorway. He sniffed twice at the air. \u201cCalm, Nora, this is Grayson,\u201d he said. \u201cHe works with me at the warehouse.\u201d\nOf course, I thought. My roommate knew everyone. He was always bringing people back to our house. I knew then what kind of person you might be. You didn't have a lot of friends. Why else would you be here with him? You were awkward and adverse to authority. Otherwise, Andrew\u2019s conspiracy theories would have scared you away. You didn\u2019t do your homework or go to class, or else you wouldn\u2019t be in a stranger\u2019s house on a Wednesday night. You smelled like the woods far, far away from this town, farther away even than the town Andrew and I grew up in in.\n\u201cWant to smoke a joint with us?\u201d Andrew asked. You still said nothing. I wondered if you could talk. I\u2019d never seen you smile.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, walking past you to my room.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nNo one but Andrew and me.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIn the morning, you were passed out on our couch. The blanket had slid down your chest, and I could see your flabby stomach, pasty white as the moon. My stomach growled. I grabbed a white bread bagel on my way out the door. I never skipped class. I never got hangovers. Not from drinking, not from drugs. I walked to class with your blank gaze burning behind my eyes.\nThe second dreams I had about you were sweaty. I woke to slick sheets. I woke to blood and cramps. I woke to tingling skin and the deep belly urge to plunge my fingers between my legs until my breath came out hard and quick as a chased predator\u2019s. Your skin, in those dreams, tasted like sunlight and honey. You were always naked.\nThe next time I saw you, sitting on a bench outside the history building, you smiled at me. Your smile was as ugly and crooked as death. No wonder you rarely smiled. Your smell was overwhelming, then, like the scent of a home I'd never realized that I had. I knew with a gut animal instinct that you were not who I had thought you were. I was willing to give you a try.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWe did not sleep together then. You were my roommate\u2019s friend, and his scent was all over you, too, like cologne. Instead I took home other men, made rough love to them with my eyes shut tight. I pretended they were you. Still, you went with me to bars, to parties I sniffed out. We walked down streets until we heard laughter, until we sniffed the skunk smell of dank weed. At parties we stuck side by side at first, until the moon trembled tentatively in the sky and it was time to pick a partner and go home.\nEach night I hugged you goodbye so close I could smell your sweat stink. I let it rub off onto my shirt. When I fucked those other people, I left my shirt on. I let them go in the mornings with bite marks across their necks.\nSometimes you were on the couch, pretending to sleep. Once, when I asked why you had come there, you said Andrew asked you over. Sometimes Andrew went to the party with us. But always you clung to him as though he was the leader of your pack. I came to know the reason; you wanted to be close enough to protect me, if I needed it. I never needed it. You could hear the gasp screams that came from my room. I imagine that to you they were a sick lullaby.\nI was not good to you. I don\u2019t know why you stomached it.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWe went camping, all of the pack. Me and you and Andrew and the temporary people who floated in and out of our lives like specks in the corners of our eyes. In a college town, that was bound to happen, people still getting to know themselves. Very few people liked me once they got to know me. Too predatory and wild and ambitious. You, though. You stuck around and made friends of an enemy.\nWe had a tent to ourselves. I insisted on my own tent. We swallowed three grams of shrooms and went walking. The river was a snake. The water was your spilled blood. Not yet, I said. You thought I meant sex. I meant death. I took you by the river. You were soft and sweet and your skin hummed and shifted. In the dark you looked familiar, like your old town might have been like ours, like you might be like us.\n\u201cAre you one of us?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cI\u2019m one with you,\u201d you said.\nIt wasn\u2019t what I meant. We zipped the tent and unzipped our pants and unzipped our skins and knew each other bone by bone.\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d I whispered.\nWhen you came, you howled like a dying dog.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cThis is where you came from,\u201d you said. \u201cThis is who you are.\u201d\nIn Agape I drove you around the city on the main street which wrapped like teeth around the fire station, past the lone cop car that sat empty in the church parking lot, past the BBQ joint with the smell of roasting flesh, past the house I had been raised in.\n\u201cCan we go in?\u201d you asked.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s so quiet,\u201d you said. \u201cThere\u2019s no one. Is anyone home?\u201d\n\"They're home. They're hiding. They all hide, here.\u201d\nI kept on driving. The streets were as dead as the day I had left them.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cTake me anywhere,\u201d you said. \u201cWe need to get away for a while.\u201d\nI wanted you to drive. I wanted to see where you came from. But you shook your head. \u201cToo tired,\u201d you said. \u201cToo tired to drive.\u201d\nThere was only one place I knew the way to.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cDo you feel welcome?\u201d I asked you.\nYou looked over at me. Already, I was forgetting everything I had learned since leaving. In Agape I am the same stupid teenager I was in high school. In Agape I am as hungry as a growing girl. My stomach growled. You were kind enough not to mention it. But you had a look in your eye; you were wary of me. You saw that my pupils were dilating, that my eyes were darkening. You saw that I was who I had always been.\n\u201cNo,\u201d you said. \u201cI don\u2019t know you here.\u201d\nWe came to the playground behind the church. I wanted to show you the spot where it had all begun, where I had first bled for a boy. I would bleed for you, I wanted to say. I should have bled for you. But you weren't one of us after all.\nSome things never change. You smelled like the first time. You bled like the most intoxicating liquor I had ever tasted. You did not bite back.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Grayson?\u201d he asks, but he doesn\u2019t expect an answer. He knows without looking at me. He has always known. We are two of a pack.\nTogether we bury your bones in our back yard. We build a garden over them.\nSome nights I still dream about you. I wake up with your taste on my tongue. Times like these, I go out to the garden and pick red tomatoes from the stalk. I sink my teeth into them. Juice drips all over my hands, my feet, my thighs. I imagine that you are here with me. That you are the pulsing moon. That you are in Agape, waiting for me to retrieve you, to save you, to carry you home.","source":"https:\/\/www.3lobedmag.com\/issue26\/3lbe26_story2.html","source-hostname":"Three-Lobed Burning Eye Magazine","excerpt":"You were familiar to me.

McDermott\nHe smoked, too. And he was ugly. He didn\u2019t really know what to make of me because army guys don\u2019t meet a lot of lesbians.)\nHe says, I don\u2019t think the world will end with the weapons I\u2019m guarding. I don\u2019t think this empty stretch of damp concrete adumbrates the future of the cities when the war machines level the buildings and all the towers fall into a rubble of concertina wire and dying men in isolation suits and nuclear winter.\nI\u2019m in front of the dangerous weapons, watching storm clouds tumble all over each other like lovers wrapped in gray pillows frantically rolling into the moment of the rain.\nI think that the end of the world will come when the people choose to leave the cities for the wild places.\nSomeday people will forget why soldiers and healthcare and schools matter. We\u2019ll just walk away into the green hills like African Bushmen. It happens everyday somewhere, when men and women decide to walk away from homes and civilization and become bums or survivalists. It happens all the time in Africa, Arctic Canada, China, South America, and the Pacific Islands. People just collectively stand up, and walk into the wilderness with nothing but a knife and a vague sense of primitive purpose.\nAnd some folks will try to hold on to civilization. We\u2019ll be guarding these places like soldiers until no one knows why \u2014 not even us. And cults will form around these sacred spots. And radiation poisoning will claim any who defile the temple. And civilization will start over around these forbidden places.\nI tell my fellow soldier on guard duty about how Bacchus made the pirates into dolphins, and they swam away, joyfully into the sea, with a freedom the children of Athena \u2014 like us \u2014 will never know.\nHe tells me I should read the Bible and give up all these false mythologies for the love of Jesus Christ. He tells me that he\u2019d love to pray with me.\nAfter duty, I got on a bus downtown, and thought about how the buses of Germany have signs prohibiting the wearing of roller skates, and the eating of ice cream, and how someone must have died of rollerskates, and ice cream. I got off, and I was thinking about death, and I was thinking about death, and I was thinking about all death.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI can tell she came from Russia, originally, because of the way she stands in darkness and the way she looks at the world in darkness and the wonderful Russian syrup in her accent. She smokes cigarettes in the Mainz marketplace beside a man with a llama\u2019s bridle in one hand and a coin can in the other. She smokes with one hand and gracefully runs her other hand\u2019s fingertips, with her long, red nails, across the llama\u2019s long neck.\nWhen she sees me looking at her, she puts the cigarette in her mouth. She grabs the lapels of my jacket. She says something wonderful in German. I have no idea what she says. Then she says something in Russian. I still don\u2019t understand.\nI drop a single Euro into the llama man\u2019s can. I take her arm. She leads me into an alley between a clothing store and a travel agency. We take an elevator up to the top floor. She leads me to a single room apartment with one window. I lean out the window, and the bustling city moves with the anonymous kind of love that happens in any neighborhood \u2014 that general sense of well-being while people who recognize each other say hello.\nShe has an electric pot \u2014 no stove in sight \u2014 sitting on a table covered with bunched up clothes and receipts and a cereal bowl that had become an ash tray and bits of fruit loops and dried up milk slept beneath this loamy ash from foreign cigarettes and broken, lipstick-stained cigarette butts curled erotically around cigarette butts with no lipstick stains at all.\nI sit down on the bed. It\u2019s the only place to sit. I could reach out and touch her long, black hair. She stands near the table, waiting for the tea to boil, and she lights up a new cigarette.\nThe room stinks of cigarettes and something else I can\u2019t place, but familiar.\nThe pot screams when it boils. Hot steam runs up the wall, and I notice how the wallpaper beside the teapot\u2019s mouth has curdled and bubbled like a second-degree sunburn.\n(That reminded me of when I rubbed lotion into her back in St. Louis in our puny motel room after we had spent all day walking around and she had forgotten that this one spot on her shoulders was exposed to the sun in this normal, t-shirt when that spot wasn\u2019t exposed in her usual uniform. She had this little line, like a collar of bubbles on her shoulders. I had to be so careful when I put the lotion on her, and it was disgusting to feel all those fluids moving just under her skin.\nOh, my dark woman.)\nThe Russian girl gets my attention with a snap of her fingers. She hands me a cup of peppery tea.\nShe, apparently, speaks a little bit of English. She says \u201cDrink\u201d with the throaty femme fatale way that has warmed a thousand cinema screens. She points at body parts. She lists escalating amounts of money.\nI give her everything in my pockets, and it\u2019s almost enough for everything I want from her.\nThe tea on the table cools while we warm to each other\u2019s touch. When we pretend to strip naked we keep the pleasure masks of our commerce between us, so we do not open up our faces, really, in intimacy. When we pretend to scrape at each other\u2019s skins ravenously, she speaks one small word that could have been German for \u2018there\u2019, or Russian for \u2018yes\u2019.\nDa\u2026 Da\u2026 Da\u2026 Da\u2026 Da\u2026\nAnd maybe it\u2019s English, too, and I push that out of my head because I don\u2019t want to think about what her father would think about this thing we\u2019re doing.\nI just want one thing from her. I get it.\nAfterwards, she lets me rest in her bed while she smokes another cigarette and watches a reality television show dubbed from Dutch to Deutsch about a whole neighborhood block that has become a walled city and all the people inside lose contact with the outside world, lose all their privacy, and do not know exactly what will keep them in the city or get them voted out.\nThe show simulates the outbreak of a dangerous plague, and not enough medicine exists to keep the population alive.\nIt\u2019s the end of the world.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nEach week these people inside the show watched the men in yellow isolation suits appear, take half of the survivors by the arm, and lead them away to who knows where off-screen. The rest got a bottle of pills for the week \u2014 placebos, I assumed.\nWith the language barrier and the horrible quality of the picture in the hidden cameras, I couldn\u2019t tell if these people knew this was only a television show. I couldn\u2019t tell if it wasn\u2019t real, either.\nOne night a crowded city block had gone to bed. The next morning concertina wire separated them from the civilized world. Men in terrifying isolation suits handed out placebos and cut off all communication with the outside, blaming the plague. Each week, half their number got no medicine and they were led away to their imminent doom in a hospital bed.\nPlacebos went every week to the ones that had gotten enough votes to survive. They could do whatever they wanted with the pills. If they didn\u2019t take all of them they were led away as if they had been voted off. They could give them away if they wanted, or sell them.\nA certain Russian prostitute never seemed to die, though everyone seemed to hate her on the show. I watched how she kept finding someone to give her a placebo in exchange for one, long night that European television showed in sensual, stylish blips that \u2014 the advertisements assured us \u2014 had extended into various adult websites available for subscription.\nThe woman in the bed with me pointed at the woman on the screen. \u201cSchwester,\u201d she said, \u201cSister, ja?\u201d\nI nodded, sadly. I saw the resemblance in a flash. I rubbed her shoulders.\nShe pushed me away. She looked at me like she was disgusted that I had touched her.\nI put my clothes back on.\nJust like a real epidemic, the very old and very young died fast. By the time I had my foot out the door, there were only beautiful young women, and men with quick tongues and chiseled abs. They fell in and out of love recklessly, tears streaming down their faces as their friends and families disappeared to die.\nIn the real world, I left the dark woman there, while she pulled for her sister. The door opened and closed without a good-bye. I left behind a pack of cigarettes, like a placebo, but mine were deadly.\nHalfway down the hall, I heard her scream in agony. I knew it was her sister. Her sister had been led away by the men in isolation suits and had left television and had returned to the marketplace and to smoke cigarettes and live the kind of life where people don\u2019t look at her. When the icy fingers of death really did spread across her face she would only be a smell of perfume and smoke, like burning gardens. When the men like me smelled her, we would \u2014 alas \u2014 remember nothing.\n(I finished my cold absinthe in the bar with the soldier. I carried this soldier\u2019s story across continents. Now, I\u2019ve given all the soldier\u2019s words to you.)\n\u2022\n\u00a9 2010 J.M.
